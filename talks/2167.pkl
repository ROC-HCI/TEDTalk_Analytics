VWhen you grow up in a developing country like India, as I did,
p5
aVyou instantly learn to get more value from limited resources
p6
aVand find creative ways to reuse what you already have.
p7
aVTake Mansukh Prajapati, a potter in India.
p8
aVHe has created a fridge made entirely of clay
p9
aVthat consumes no electricity.
p10
aVHe can keep fruits and vegetables fresh for many days.
p11
aVThat's a cool invention, literally.
p12
aVIn Africa, if you run out of your cell phone battery, don't panic.
p13
aVYou will find some resourceful entrepreneurs
p14
aVwho can recharge your  cell phone using bicycles.
p15
aVAnd since we are in South America,
p16
aVlet's go to Lima in Peru,
p17
aVa region with high humidity
p18
aVthat receives only one inch of rainfall each year.
p19
aVAn engineering college in Lima designed a giant advertising billboard
p20
aVthat absorbs air humidity and converts it into purified water,
p21
aVgenerating over 90 liters of water every day.
p22
aVThe Peruvians are amazing.
p23
aVThey can literally create water out of thin air.
p24
aa(lp25
VFor the past seven years,
p26
aVI have met and studied hundreds of entrepreneurs
p27
aVin India, China, Africa and South America, and they keep amazing me.
p28
aVMany of them did not go to school.
p29
aVThey don't invent stuff in big R&D labs.
p30
aVThe street is the lab.
p31
aVWhy do they do that?
p32
aVBecause they don't have the kind of basic resources we take for granted,
p33
aVlike capital and energy,
p34
aVand basic services like healthcare and education
p35
aVare also scarce in those regions.
p36
aVWhen external resources are scarce, you have to go within yourself
p37
aVto tap the most abundant resource, human ingenuity,
p38
aVand use that ingenuity to find clever ways to solve problems with limited resources.
p39
aa(lp40
VIn India, we call it Jugaad.
p41
aVJugaad is a Hindi word
p42
aVthat means an improvised fix, a clever solution born in adversity.
p43
aVJugaad solutions are not sophisticated or perfect,
p44
aVbut they create more value at lower cost.
p45
aVFor me, the entrepreneurs who will create Jugaad solutions
p46
aVare like alchemists.
p47
aVThey can magically transform adversity into opportunity,
p48
aVand turn something of less value into something of high value.
p49
aVIn other words, they mastered the art of doing more with less,
p50
aVwhich is the essence of frugal innovation.
p51
aa(lp52
VFrugal innovation is the ability  to create more economic and social value
p53
aVusing fewer resources.
p54
aVFrugal innovation is not about making do; it's about making things better.
p55
aVNow I want to show you how, across emerging markets,
p56
aVentrepreneurs and companies are adopting  frugal innovation on a larger scale
p57
aVto cost-effectively deliver healthcare and energy to billions of people
p58
aVwho may have little income but very high aspirations.
p59
aa(lp60
VLet's first go to China,
p61
aVwhere the country's largest I.T. service provider, Neusoft,
p62
aVhas developed a telemedicine solution
p63
aVto help doctors in cities remotely treat old and poor patients
p64
aVin Chinese villages.
p65
aVThis solution is based on simple-to-use medical devices
p66
aVthat less qualified health workers like nurses can use in rural clinics.
p67
aVChina desperately needs these frugal medical solutions
p68
aVbecause by 2050 it will be home to over half a billion senior citizens.
p69
aa(lp70
VNow let's go to Kenya,
p71
aVa country where half the population uses M-Pesa, a mobile payment solution.
p72
aVThis is a great solution for the African continent
p73
aVbecause 80 percent of Africans don't have a bank account,
p74
aVbut what is exciting is that M-Pesa is now becoming the source
p75
aVof other disruptive business models in sectors like energy.
p76
aVTake M-KOPA, the home solar solution that comes literally in a box
p77
aVthat has a solar rooftop panel, three LED lights,
p78
aVa solar radio, and a cell phone charger.
p79
aVThe whole kit, though, costs 200 dollars, which is too expensive for most Kenyans,
p80
aVand this is where mobile telephony can make the solution more affordable.
p81
aVToday, you can buy this kit by making an initial deposit of just 35 dollars,
p82
aVand then pay off the rest by making a daily micro-payment of 45 cents
p83
aVusing your mobile phone.
p84
aVOnce you've made 365 micro-payments, the system is unlocked,
p85
aVand you own the product and you start  receiving clean, free electricity.
p86
aVThis is an amazing solution for Kenya,
p87
aVwhere 70 percent of people live off the grid.
p88
aVThis shows that with frugal innovation
p89
aVwhat matters is that you take what is most abundant, mobile connectivity,
p90
aVto deal with what is scarce, which is energy.
p91
aa(lp92
VWith frugal innovation, the global South is actually catching up
p93
aVand in some cases  even leap-frogging the North.
p94
aVInstead of building expensive hospitals, China is using telemedicine
p95
aVto cost-effectively treat millions of patients,
p96
aVand Africa, instead of building banks and electricity grids,
p97
aVis going straight to mobile payments and distributed clean energy.
p98
aa(lp99
VFrugal innovation is diametrically opposed to the way we innovate in the North.
p100
aVI live in Silicon Valley,
p101
aVwhere we keep chasing the next big technology thing.
p102
aVThink of the iPhone 5, 6, then 7, 8.
p103
aVCompanies in the West spend billions of dollars investing in R&D,
p104
aVand use tons of natural resources to create ever more complex products,
p105
aVto differentiate their brands from competition,
p106
aVand they charge customers more money for new features.
p107
aVSo the conventional business model  in the West is more for more.
p108
aVBut sadly, this more for more model is running out of gas, for three reasons:
p109
aVFirst, a big portion of customers in the West
p110
aVbecause of the diminishing purchasing power,
p111
aVcan no longer afford these expensive products.
p112
aVSecond, we are running out of natural water and oil.
p113
aVIn California, where I live, water scarcity is becoming a big problem.
p114
aVAnd third, most importantly,
p115
aVbecause of the growing income disparity
p116
aVbetween the rich  and the middle class in the West,
p117
aVthere is a big disconnect between existing products and services
p118
aVand basic needs of customers.
p119
aVDo you know that today,
p120
aVthere are over 70 million Americans today who are underbanked,
p121
aVbecause existing banking services
p122
aVare not designed to address their basic needs.
p123
aa(lp124
VThe prolonged economic crisis in the West is making people think
p125
aVthat they are about to lose the high standard of living
p126
aVand face deprivation.
p127
aVI believe that the only way we can sustain growth and prosperity in the West
p128
aVis if we learn to do more with less.
p129
aa(lp130
VThe good news is, that's starting to happen.
p131
aVSeveral Western companies are now adopting frugal innovation
p132
aVto create affordable products for Western consumers.
p133
aVLet me give you two examples.
p134
aa(lp135
VWhen I first saw this building,
p136
aVI told myself it's some kind of postmodern house.
p137
aVActually, it's a small manufacturing plant set up by Grameen Danone,
p138
aVa joint venture between  Grameen Bank of Muhammad Yunus
p139
aVand the food multinational Danone
p140
aVto make high-quality yogurt in Bangladesh.
p141
aVThis factory is 10 percent the size of existing Danone factories
p142
aVand cost much less to build.
p143
aVI guess you can call it a low-fat factory.
p144
aVNow this factory, unlike Western factories that are highly automated,
p145
aVrelies a lot on manual processes in order  to generate jobs for local communities.
p146
aVDanone was so inspired by this model
p147
aVthat combines economic efficiency and social sustainability,
p148
aVthey are planning to roll it out in other parts of the world as well.
p149
aa(lp150
VNow, when you see this example,
p151
aVyou might be thinking, "Well, frugal innovation is low tech."
p152
aVActually, no.
p153
aVFrugal innovation is also about making high tech
p154
aVmore affordable and more accessible to more people.
p155
aVLet me give you an example.
p156
aa(lp157
VIn China, the R&D engineers of Siemens Healthcare
p158
aVhave designed a C.T. scanner that is easy enough to be used
p159
aVby less qualified health workers, like nurses and technicians.
p160
aVThis device can scan more patients on a daily basis,
p161
aVand yet consumes less energy,
p162
aVwhich is great for hospitals, but it's also great for patients
p163
aVbecause it reduces the cost of treatment by 30 percent
p164
aVand radiation dosage by up to 60 percent.
p165
aVThis solution was initially designed for the Chinese market,
p166
aVbut now it's selling like hotcakes in the U.S. and Europe,
p167
aVwhere hospitals are pressured to deliver quality care at lower cost.
p168
aa(lp169
VBut the frugal innovation revolution
p170
aVin the West is actually led by creative entrepreneurs
p171
aVwho are coming up with amazing solutions
p172
aVto address basic needs in the U.S. and Europe.
p173
aVLet me quickly give you three examples of startups
p174
aVthat personally inspire me.
p175
aVThe first one happens to be launched by my neighbor in Silicon Valley.
p176
aVIt's called gThrive.
p177
aVThey make these wireless sensors designed like plastic rulers
p178
aVthat farmers can stick in different parts of the field
p179
aVand start collecting detailed information like soil conditions.
p180
aVThis dynamic data allows farmers to optimize use of water energy
p181
aVwhile improving quality of the products and the yields,
p182
aVwhich is a great solution for California, which faces major water shortage.
p183
aVIt pays for itself within one year.
p184
aa(lp185
VSecond example is Be-Bound, also in Silicon Valley,
p186
aVthat enables you to connect to the Internet
p187
aVeven in no-bandwidth areas where there's no wi-fi or 3G or 4G.
p188
aVHow do they do that?
p189
aVThey simply use SMS, a basic technology, but that happens to be the most reliable
p190
aVand most widely available around the world.
p191
aVThree billion people today with  cell phones can't access the Internet.
p192
aVThis solution can connect them to the Internet in a frugal way.
p193
aa(lp194
VAnd in France, there is a startup calle Compte Nickel,
p195
aVwhich is revolutionizing the banking sector.
p196
aVIt allows thousands of people to walk into a Mom and Pop store
p197
aVand in just five minutes activate the service that gives them two products:
p198
aVan international bank account number and an international debit card.
p199
aVThey charge a flat annual  maintenance fee of just 20 Euros.
p200
aVThat means you can do all banking transactions \u2014
p201
aVsend and receive money, pay with your debit card \u2014
p202
aVall with no additional charge.
p203
aVThis is what I call low-cost banking without the bank.
p204
aVAmazingly, 75 percent of the customers using this service
p205
aVare the middle-class French who can't afford high banking fees.
p206
aa(lp207
VNow, I talked about frugal innovation, initially pioneered in the South,
p208
aVnow being adopted in the North.
p209
aVUltimately, we would like to see
p210
aVdeveloped countries and developing countries
p211
aVcome together and co-create frugal solutions
p212
aVthat benefit the entire humanity.
p213
aVThe exciting news is that's starting to happen.
p214
aVLet's go to Nairobi to find that out.
p215
aa(lp216
VNairobi has horrendous traffic jams.
p217
aVWhen I first saw them, I thought, "Holy cow."
p218
aVLiterally, because you have to dodge cows as well when you drive in Nairobi.
p219
aVTo ease the situation,
p220
aVthe engineers at the IBM lab in Kenya are piloting a solution called Megaffic,
p221
aVwhich initially was designed by the Japanese engineers.
p222
aVUnlike in the West, Megaffic doesn't rely on roadside sensors,
p223
aVwhich are very expensive to install in Nairobi.
p224
aVInstead they process images, traffic data,
p225
aVcollected from a small number of low-resolution webcams in Nairobi streets,
p226
aVand then they use analytic software to predict congestion points,
p227
aVand they can SMS drivers alternate routes to take.
p228
aVGranted, Megaffic is not as sexy as self-driving cars,
p229
aVbut it promises to take Nairobi drivers from point A to point B
p230
aVat least 20 percent faster.
p231
aVAnd earlier this year, UCLA Health launched its Global Lab for Innovation,
p232
aVwhich seeks to identify frugal healthcare  solutions anywhere in the world
p233
aVthat will be at least 20 percent cheaper than existing solutions in the U.S.
p234
aVand yet more effective.
p235
aVIt also tries to bring together innovators from North and South
p236
aVto cocreate affordable healthcare solutions for all of humanity.
p237
aa(lp238
VI gave tons of examples of frugal innovators from around the world,
p239
aVbut the question is, how do you go about adopting frugal innovation?
p240
aVWell, I gleaned out three principles from frugal innovators around the world
p241
aVthat I want to share with you
p242
aVthat you can apply in your own organization
p243
aVto do more with less.
p244
aa(lp245
VThe first principle is: Keep it simple.
p246
aVDon't create solutions to impress customers.
p247
aVMake them easy enough to use and widely accessible,
p248
aVlike the C.T. scanner we saw in China.
p249
aa(lp250
VSecond principle:  Do not reinvent the wheel.
p251
aVTry to leverage existing resources and assets that are widely available,
p252
aVlike using mobile telephony to offer clean energy
p253
aVor Mom and Pop stores to offer banking services.
p254
aa(lp255
VThird principle is: Think and act horizontally.
p256
aVCompanies tend to scale up vertically
p257
aVby centralizing operations in big factories and warehouses,
p258
aVbut if you want to be agile and deal with immense customer diversity,
p259
aVyou need to scale out horizontally using a distributed supply chain
p260
aVwith smaller manufacturing and distribution units,
p261
aVlike Grameen Bank has shown.
p262
aa(lp263
VThe South pioneered frugal innovation out of sheer necessity.
p264
aVThe North is now learning to do more and better with less
p265
aVas it faces resource constraints.
p266
aVAs an Indian-born French national who lives in the United States,
p267
aVmy hope is that we transcend this artificial North-South divide
p268
aVso that we can harness the collective ingenuity
p269
aVof innovators from around the world
p270
aVto cocreate frugal solutions
p271
aVthat will improve the quality of life of everyone in the world,
p272
aVwhile preserving our precious planet.
p273
aa(lp274
VThank you very much.
p275
aa(lp276
V(Applause)

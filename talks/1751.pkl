VWhen I was a young boy,
p5
aVI used to gaze through the microscope of my father
p6
aVat the insects in amber that he kept in the house.
p7
aVAnd they were remarkably well preserved,
p8
aVmorphologically just phenomenal.
p9
aVAnd we used to imagine that someday,
p10
aVthey would actually come to life
p11
aVand they would crawl out of the resin,
p12
aVand, if they could, they would fly away.
p13
aa(lp14
VIf you had asked me 10 years ago whether or not
p15
aVwe would ever be able to sequence the genome of extinct animals,
p16
aVI would have told you, it's unlikely.
p17
aVIf you had asked whether or not we would actually be able
p18
aVto revive an extinct species,
p19
aVI would have said, pipe dream.
p20
aVBut I'm actually standing here today, amazingly,
p21
aVto tell you that not only is the sequencing
p22
aVof extinct genomes a possibility, actually a modern-day reality,
p23
aVbut the revival of an extinct species is actually within reach,
p24
aVmaybe not from the insects in amber \u2014
p25
aVin fact, this mosquito was actually used
p26
aVfor the inspiration for "Jurassic Park" \u2014
p27
aVbut from woolly mammoths, the well preserved remains
p28
aVof woolly mammoths in the permafrost.
p29
aa(lp30
VWoollies are a particularly interesting,
p31
aVquintessential image of the Ice Age.
p32
aVThey were large. They were hairy.
p33
aVThey had large tusks, and we seem to have
p34
aVa very deep connection with them, like we do with elephants.
p35
aVMaybe it's because elephants share
p36
aVmany things in common with us.
p37
aVThey bury their dead. They educate the next of kin.
p38
aVThey have social knits that are very close.
p39
aVOr maybe it's actually because we're bound by deep time,
p40
aVbecause elephants, like us, share their origins in Africa
p41
aVsome seven million years ago,
p42
aVand as habitats changed and environments changed,
p43
aVwe actually, like the elephants, migrated out
p44
aVinto Europe and Asia.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo the first large mammoth that appears on the scene
p47
aVis meridionalis, which was standing four meters tall
p48
aVweighing about 10 tons, and was a woodland-adapted species
p49
aVand spread from Western Europe clear across Central Asia,
p50
aVacross the Bering land bridge
p51
aVand into parts of North America.
p52
aVAnd then, again, as climate changed as it always does,
p53
aVand new habitats opened up,
p54
aVwe had the arrival of a steppe-adapted species
p55
aVcalled trogontherii in Central Asia
p56
aVpushing meridionalis out into Western Europe.
p57
aVAnd the open grassland savannas of North America
p58
aVopened up, leading to the Columbian mammoth,
p59
aVa large, hairless species in North America.
p60
aVAnd it was really only about 500,000 years later
p61
aVthat we had the arrival of the woolly,
p62
aVthe one that we all know and love so much,
p63
aVspreading from an East Beringian point of origin
p64
aVacross Central Asia, again pushing the trogontherii
p65
aVout through Central Europe,
p66
aVand over hundreds of thousands of years
p67
aVmigrating back and forth across the Bering land bridge
p68
aVduring times of glacial peaks
p69
aVand coming into direct contact
p70
aVwith the Columbian relatives living in the south,
p71
aVand there they survive over hundreds of thousands of years
p72
aVduring traumatic climatic shifts.
p73
aVSo there's a highly plastic animal dealing with great transitions
p74
aVin temperature and environment, and doing very, very well.
p75
aVAnd there they survive on the mainland until about 10,000 years ago,
p76
aVand actually, surprisingly, on the small islands off of Siberia
p77
aVand Alaska until about 3,000 years ago.
p78
aVSo Egyptians are building pyramids
p79
aVand woollies are still living on islands.
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd then they disappear.
p82
aVLike 99 percent of all the animals that have once lived,
p83
aVthey go extinct, likely due to a warming climate
p84
aVand fast-encroaching dense forests
p85
aVthat are migrating north,
p86
aVand also, as the late, great Paul Martin once put it,
p87
aVprobably Pleistocene overkill,
p88
aVso the large game hunters that took them down.
p89
aa(lp90
VFortunately, we find millions of their remains
p91
aVstrewn across the permafrost buried deep
p92
aVin Siberia and Alaska, and we can actually go up there
p93
aVand actually take them out.
p94
aVAnd the preservation is, again,
p95
aVlike those insects in [amber], phenomenal.
p96
aVSo you have teeth, bones with blood
p97
aVwhich look like blood, you have hair,
p98
aVand you have intact carcasses or heads
p99
aVwhich still have brains in them.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo the preservation and the survival of DNA
p102
aVdepends on many factors, and I have to admit,
p103
aVmost of which we still don't quite understand,
p104
aVbut depending upon when an organism dies
p105
aVand how quickly he's buried, the depth of that burial,
p106
aVthe constancy of the temperature of that burial environment,
p107
aVwill ultimately dictate how long DNA will survive
p108
aVover geologically meaningful time frames.
p109
aVAnd it's probably surprising to many of you
p110
aVsitting in this room that it's not the time that matters,
p111
aVit's not the length of preservation,
p112
aVit's the consistency of the temperature of that preservation that matters most.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo if we were to go deep now within the bones
p115
aVand the teeth that actually survived the fossilization process,
p116
aVthe DNA which was once intact, tightly wrapped
p117
aVaround histone proteins, is now under attack
p118
aVby the bacteria that lived symbiotically with the mammoth
p119
aVfor years during its lifetime.
p120
aVSo those bacteria, along with the environmental bacteria,
p121
aVfree water and oxygen, actually break apart the DNA
p122
aVinto smaller and smaller and smaller DNA fragments,
p123
aVuntil all you have are fragments that range
p124
aVfrom 10 base pairs to, in the best case scenarios,
p125
aVa few hundred base pairs in length.
p126
aVSo most fossils out there in the fossil record
p127
aVare actually completely devoid of all organic signatures.
p128
aVBut a few of them actually have DNA fragments
p129
aVthat survive for thousands,
p130
aVeven a few millions of years in time.
p131
aVAnd using state-of-the-art clean room technology,
p132
aVwe've devised ways that we can actually pull these DNAs
p133
aVaway from all the rest of the gunk in there,
p134
aVand it's not surprising to any of you sitting in the room
p135
aVthat if I take a mammoth bone or a tooth
p136
aVand I extract its DNA that I'll get mammoth DNA,
p137
aVbut I'll also get all the bacteria that once lived with the mammoth,
p138
aVand, more complicated, I'll get all the DNA
p139
aVthat survived in that environment with it,
p140
aVso the bacteria, the fungi, and so on and so forth.
p141
aVNot surprising then again that a mammoth
p142
aVpreserved in the permafrost will have something
p143
aVon the order of 50 percent of its DNA being mammoth,
p144
aVwhereas something like the Columbian mammoth,
p145
aVliving in a temperature and buried in a temperate environment
p146
aVover its laying-in will only have 3 to 10 percent endogenous.
p147
aa(lp148
VBut we've come up with very clever ways
p149
aVthat we can actually discriminate, capture and discriminate,
p150
aVthe mammoth from the non-mammoth DNA,
p151
aVand with the advances in high-throughput sequencing,
p152
aVwe can actually pull out and bioinformatically
p153
aVre-jig all these small mammoth fragments
p154
aVand place them onto a backbone
p155
aVof an Asian or African elephant chromosome.
p156
aVAnd so by doing that, we can actually get all the little points
p157
aVthat discriminate between a mammoth and an Asian elephant,
p158
aVand what do we know, then, about a mammoth?
p159
aa(lp160
VWell, the mammoth genome is almost at full completion,
p161
aVand we know that it's actually really big. It's mammoth.
p162
aVSo a hominid genome is about three billion base pairs,
p163
aVbut an elephant and mammoth genome
p164
aVis about two billion base pairs larger, and most of that
p165
aVis composed of small, repetitive DNAs
p166
aVthat make it very difficult to actually re-jig the entire structure of the genome.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo having this information allows us to answer
p169
aVone of the interesting relationship questions
p170
aVbetween mammoths and their living relatives,
p171
aVthe African and the Asian elephant,
p172
aVall of which shared an ancestor seven million years ago,
p173
aVbut the genome of the mammoth shows it to share
p174
aVa most recent common ancestor with Asian elephants
p175
aVabout six million years ago,
p176
aVso slightly closer to the Asian elephant.
p177
aa(lp178
VWith advances in ancient DNA technology,
p179
aVwe can actually now start to begin to sequence
p180
aVthe genomes of those other extinct mammoth forms that I mentioned,
p181
aVand I just wanted to talk about two of them,
p182
aVthe woolly and the Columbian mammoth,
p183
aVboth of which were living very close to each other
p184
aVduring glacial peaks,
p185
aVso when the glaciers were massive in North America,
p186
aVthe woollies were pushed into these subglacial ecotones,
p187
aVand came into contact with the relatives living to the south,
p188
aVand there they shared refugia,
p189
aVand a little bit more than the refugia, it turns out.
p190
aVIt looks like they were interbreeding.
p191
aVAnd that this is not an uncommon feature
p192
aVin Proboscideans, because it turns out
p193
aVthat large savanna male elephants will outcompete
p194
aVthe smaller forest elephants for their females.
p195
aVSo large, hairless Columbians
p196
aVoutcompeting the smaller male woollies.
p197
aVIt reminds me a bit of high school, unfortunately.
p198
aa(lp199
V(Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
VSo this is not trivial, given the idea that we want
p202
aVto revive extinct species, because it turns out
p203
aVthat an African and an Asian elephant
p204
aVcan actually interbreed and have live young,
p205
aVand this has actually occurred by accident in a zoo
p206
aVin Chester, U.K., in 1978.
p207
aVSo that means that we can actually take Asian elephant chromosomes,
p208
aVmodify them into all those positions we've actually now
p209
aVbeen able to discriminate with the mammoth genome,
p210
aVwe can put that into an enucleated cell,
p211
aVdifferentiate that into a stem cell,
p212
aVsubsequently differentiate that maybe into a sperm,
p213
aVartificially inseminate an Asian elephant egg,
p214
aVand over a long and arduous procedure,
p215
aVactually bring back something that looks like this.
p216
aVNow, this wouldn't be an exact replica,
p217
aVbecause the short DNA fragments that I told you about
p218
aVwill prevent us from building the exact structure,
p219
aVbut it would make something that looked and felt
p220
aVvery much like a woolly mammoth did.
p221
aa(lp222
VNow, when I bring up this with my friends,
p223
aVwe often talk about, well, where would you put it?
p224
aVWhere are you going to house a mammoth?
p225
aVThere's no climates or habitats suitable.
p226
aVWell, that's not actually the case.
p227
aVIt turns out that there are swaths of habitat
p228
aVin the north of Siberia and Yukon
p229
aVthat actually could house a mammoth.
p230
aVRemember, this was a highly plastic animal
p231
aVthat lived over tremendous climate variation.
p232
aVSo this landscape would be easily able to house it,
p233
aVand I have to admit that there [is] a part of the child in me,
p234
aVthe boy in me, that would love to see
p235
aVthese majestic creatures walk across the permafrost
p236
aVof the north once again, but I do have to admit
p237
aVthat part of the adult in me sometimes wonders
p238
aVwhether or not we should.
p239
aa(lp240
VThank you very much.
p241
aa(lp242
V(Applause)
p243
aa(lp244
VRyan Phelan: Don't go away.
p245
aVYou've left us with a question.
p246
aVI'm sure everyone is asking this. When you say, "Should we?"
p247
aVit feels like you're reticent there,
p248
aVand yet you've given us a vision of it being so possible.
p249
aVWhat's your reticence?
p250
aa(lp251
VHendrik Poinar: I don't think it's reticence.
p252
aVI think it's just that we have to think very deeply
p253
aVabout the implications, ramifications of our actions,
p254
aVand so as long as we have good, deep discussion
p255
aVlike we're having now, I think
p256
aVwe can come to a very good solution as to why to do it.
p257
aVBut I just want to make sure that we spend time
p258
aVthinking about why we're doing it first.
p259
aa(lp260
VRP: Perfect. Perfect answer. Thank you very much, Hendrik.
p261
aa(lp262
VHP: Thank you. (Applause)

VSo, I am indeed going to talk about
p5
aVthe spaces men create for themselves,
p6
aVbut first I want to tell you why I'm here.
p7
aVI'm here for two reasons. These two guys
p8
aVare my two sons Ford and Wren.
p9
aVWhen Ford was about three years old,
p10
aVwe shared a very small room together,
p11
aVin a very small space.
p12
aVMy office was on one half of the bedroom,
p13
aVand his bedroom was on the other half.
p14
aVAnd you can imagine, if you're a writer,
p15
aVthat things would get really crowded around deadlines.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo when Wren was on the way,
p18
aVI realized I needed to find a space of my own.
p19
aVThere was no more space in the house. So I went out to the backyard,
p20
aVand without any previous building experience,
p21
aVand about 3,000 dollars and some
p22
aVrecycled materials, I built this space.
p23
aVIt had everything I needed. It was quiet.
p24
aVThere was enough space. And I had control, which was very important.
p25
aa(lp26
VAs I was building this space, I thought
p27
aVto myself, "Surely I'm not the only guy
p28
aVto have to have carved out a space for his own."
p29
aVSo I did some research.
p30
aVAnd I found that there was an historic precedence.
p31
aVHemingway had his writing space.
p32
aVElvis had two or three manspaces,
p33
aVwhich is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in Graceland.
p34
aVIn the popular culture, Superman had the Fortress of Solitude,
p35
aVand there was, of course, the Batcave.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo I realized then that I wanted to go out on a journey
p38
aVand see what guys were creating for themselves now.
p39
aVHere is one of the first spaces I found. It is in Austin, Texas,
p40
aVwhich is where I'm from.
p41
aVOn the outside it looks like a very typical garage, a nice garage.
p42
aVBut on the inside, it's anything but.
p43
aVAnd this, to me, is a pretty classic manspace.
p44
aVIt has neon concert posters, a bar
p45
aVand, of course, the leg lamp,
p46
aVwhich is very important.
p47
aa(lp48
VI soon realized that manspaces didn't have to be only inside.
p49
aVThis guy built a bowling alley in his backyard,
p50
aVout of landscaping timbers, astroturf.
p51
aVAnd he found the scoreboard in the trash.
p52
aa(lp53
VHere's another outdoor space, a little bit more sophisticated.
p54
aVThis a 1923 wooden tugboat,
p55
aVmade completely out of Douglas fir.
p56
aVThe guy did it all himself.
p57
aVAnd there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging-out space inside.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo, pretty early on in my investigations
p60
aVI realized what I was finding was not what I expected to find,
p61
aVwhich was, quite frankly, a lot of beer can pyramids
p62
aVand overstuffed couches and flat-screen TVs.
p63
aVThere were definitely hang-out spots.
p64
aVBut some were for working, some were for playing,
p65
aVsome were for guys to collect their things.
p66
aVMost of all, I was just surprised with what I was finding.
p67
aa(lp68
VTake this place for example.
p69
aVOn the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage.
p70
aVThis is in Long Island, New York.
p71
aVThe only thing that might tip you off is the round window.
p72
aVOn the inside it's a recreation of a
p73
aV16th century Japanese tea house.
p74
aVThe man imported all the materials from Japan,
p75
aVand he hired a Japanese carpenter
p76
aVto build it in the traditional style.
p77
aVIt has no nails or screws.
p78
aVAll the joints are hand-carved and hand-scribed.
p79
aa(lp80
VHere is another pretty typical scene. This is a suburban Las Vegas neighborhood.
p81
aVBut you open one of the garage doors
p82
aVand there is a professional-size boxing ring inside.
p83
aV(Laughter)
p84
aVAnd so there is a good reason for this.
p85
aVIt was built by this man who is Wayne McCullough.
p86
aVHe won the silver medal for Ireland
p87
aVin the 1992 Olympics,
p88
aVand he trains in this space. He trains other people.
p89
aVAnd right off the garage he has his own trophy room
p90
aVwhere he can sort of bask in his accomplishments,
p91
aVwhich is another sort of important part about a manspace.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo, while this space represents someone's profession,
p94
aVthis one certainly represents a passion.
p95
aVIt's made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship.
p96
aVIt's a collection of nautical antiques from the 1700s and 1800s.
p97
aVMuseum quality.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo, as I came to the end of my journey,
p100
aVI found over 50 spaces.
p101
aVAnd they were unexpected and they were surprising.
p102
aVBut they were also \u2014
p103
aVI was really impressed by how personalized they were,
p104
aVand how much work went into them.
p105
aVAnd I realized that's because the guys that I met
p106
aVwere all very passionate about what they did.
p107
aVAnd they really loved their professions.
p108
aVAnd they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies.
p109
aVAnd so they created these spaces
p110
aVto reflect what they love to do,
p111
aVand who they were.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo if you don't have a space of your own,
p114
aVI highly recommend finding one, and getting into it.
p115
aVThank you very much.
p116
aV(Applause)

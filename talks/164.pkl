VThis is a picture of Maurice Druon,
p5
aVthe Honorary Perpetual Secretary of L'Academie francaise,
p6
aVthe French Academy.
p7
aVHe is splendidly attired in his 68,000-dollar uniform,
p8
aVbefitting the role of the French Academy
p9
aVas legislating the
p10
aVcorrect usage in French
p11
aVand perpetuating the language.
p12
aVThe French Academy has two main tasks:
p13
aVit compiles a dictionary of official French.
p14
aVThey're now working on their ninth edition,
p15
aVwhich they began in 1930, and they've reached the letter P.
p16
aVThey also legislate on correct usage,
p17
aVsuch as the proper term for what the French call "email,"
p18
aVwhich ought to be "courriel."
p19
aVThe World Wide Web, the French are told,
p20
aVought to be referred to as
p21
aV"la toile d'araignee mondiale" \u2014 the Global Spider Web \u2014
p22
aVrecommendations that the French gaily ignore.
p23
aa(lp24
VNow, this is one model of how language comes to be:
p25
aVnamely, it's legislated by an academy.
p26
aVBut anyone who looks at language realizes
p27
aVthat this is a rather silly conceit,
p28
aVthat language, rather, emerges from human minds interacting from one another.
p29
aVAnd this is visible in the unstoppable change in language \u2014
p30
aVthe fact that by the time the Academy finishes their dictionary,
p31
aVit will already be well out of date.
p32
aa(lp33
VWe see it in the
p34
aVconstant appearance of slang and jargon,
p35
aVof the historical change in languages,
p36
aVin divergence of dialects
p37
aVand the formation of new languages.
p38
aVSo language is not so much a creator or shaper of human nature,
p39
aVso much as a window onto human nature.
p40
aVIn a book that I'm currently working on,
p41
aVI hope to use language to shed light on
p42
aVa number of aspects of human nature,
p43
aVincluding the cognitive machinery
p44
aVwith which humans conceptualize the world
p45
aVand the relationship types that govern human interaction.
p46
aVAnd I'm going to say a few words about each one this morning.
p47
aa(lp48
VLet me start off with a technical problem in language
p49
aVthat I've worried about for quite some time \u2014
p50
aVand indulge me
p51
aVin my passion for verbs and how they're used.
p52
aVThe problem is, which verbs go in which constructions?
p53
aVThe verb is the chassis of the sentence.
p54
aVIt's the framework onto which the other parts are bolted.
p55
aa(lp56
VLet me give you a quick reminder
p57
aVof something that you've long forgotten.
p58
aVAn intransitive verb, such as "dine," for example,
p59
aVcan't take a direct object.
p60
aVYou have to say, "Sam dined," not, "Sam dined the pizza."
p61
aVA transitive verb mandates
p62
aVthat there has to be an object there:
p63
aV"Sam devoured the pizza." You can't just say, "Sam devoured."
p64
aVThere are dozens or scores of verbs of this type,
p65
aVeach of which shapes its sentence.
p66
aVSo, a problem in explaining how children learn language,
p67
aVa problem in teaching language to adults so that they don't make grammatical errors,
p68
aVand a problem in programming computers to use language is
p69
aVwhich verbs go in which constructions.
p70
aa(lp71
VFor example, the dative construction in English.
p72
aVYou can say, "Give a muffin to a mouse," the prepositional dative.
p73
aVOr, "Give a mouse a muffin," the double-object dative.
p74
aV"Promise anything to her," "Promise her anything," and so on.
p75
aVHundreds of verbs can go both ways.
p76
aVSo a tempting generalization for a child,
p77
aVfor an adult, for a computer
p78
aVis that any verb that can appear in the construction,
p79
aV"subject-verb-thing-to-a-recipient"
p80
aVcan also be expressed as "subject-verb-recipient-thing."
p81
aVA handy thing to have,
p82
aVbecause language is infinite,
p83
aVand you can't just parrot back the sentences that you've heard.
p84
aVYou've got to extract generalizations
p85
aVso you can produce and understand new sentences.
p86
aVThis would be an example of how to do that.
p87
aa(lp88
VUnfortunately, there appear to be idiosyncratic exceptions.
p89
aVYou can say, "Biff drove the car to Chicago,"
p90
aVbut not, "Biff drove Chicago the car."
p91
aVYou can say, "Sal gave Jason a headache,"
p92
aVbut it's a bit odd to say, "Sal gave a headache to Jason."
p93
aVThe solution is that these constructions, despite initial appearance,
p94
aVare not synonymous,
p95
aVthat when you crank up the microscope
p96
aVon human cognition, you see that there's a subtle difference
p97
aVin meaning between them.
p98
aVSo, "give the X to the Y,"
p99
aVthat construction corresponds to the thought
p100
aV"cause X to go to Y." Whereas "give the Y the X"
p101
aVcorresponds to the thought "cause Y to have X."
p102
aa(lp103
VNow, many events can be subject to either construal,
p104
aVkind of like the classic figure-ground reversal illusions,
p105
aVin which you can either pay attention
p106
aVto the particular object,
p107
aVin which case the space around it recedes from attention,
p108
aVor you can see the faces in the empty space,
p109
aVin which case the object recedes out of consciousness.
p110
aVHow are these construals reflected in language?
p111
aVWell, in both cases, the thing that is construed as being affected
p112
aVis expressed as the direct object,
p113
aVthe noun after the verb.
p114
aVSo, when you think of the event as causing the muffin to go somewhere \u2014
p115
aVwhere you're doing something to the muffin \u2014
p116
aVyou say, "Give the muffin to the mouse."
p117
aVWhen you construe it as "cause the mouse to have something,"
p118
aVyou're doing something to the mouse,
p119
aVand therefore you express it as, "Give the mouse the muffin."
p120
aa(lp121
VSo which verbs go in which construction \u2014
p122
aVthe problem with which I began \u2014
p123
aVdepends on whether the verb specifies a kind of motion
p124
aVor a kind of possession change.
p125
aVTo give something involves both causing something to go
p126
aVand causing someone to have.
p127
aVTo drive the car only causes something to go,
p128
aVbecause Chicago's not the kind of thing that can possess something.
p129
aVOnly humans can possess things.
p130
aVAnd to give someone a headache causes them to have the headache,
p131
aVbut it's not as if you're taking the headache out of your head
p132
aVand causing it to go to the other person,
p133
aVand implanting it in them.
p134
aVYou may just be loud or obnoxious,
p135
aVor some other way causing them to have the headache.
p136
aVSo, that's
p137
aVan example of the kind of thing that I do in my day job.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo why should anyone care?
p140
aVWell, there are a number of interesting conclusions, I think,
p141
aVfrom this and many similar kinds of analyses
p142
aVof hundreds of English verbs.
p143
aVFirst, there's a level of fine-grained conceptual structure,
p144
aVwhich we automatically and unconsciously compute
p145
aVevery time we produce or utter a sentence, that governs our use of language.
p146
aVYou can think of this as the language of thought, or "mentalese."
p147
aa(lp148
VIt seems to be based on a fixed set of concepts,
p149
aVwhich govern dozens of constructions and thousands of verbs \u2014
p150
aVnot only in English, but in all other languages \u2014
p151
aVfundamental concepts such as space,
p152
aVtime, causation and human intention,
p153
aVsuch as, what is the means and what is the ends?
p154
aVThese are reminiscent of the kinds of categories
p155
aVthat Immanuel Kant argued
p156
aVare the basic framework for human thought,
p157
aVand it's interesting that our unconscious use of language
p158
aVseems to reflect these Kantian categories.
p159
aVDoesn't care about perceptual qualities,
p160
aVsuch as color, texture, weight and speed,
p161
aVwhich virtually never differentiate
p162
aVthe use of verbs in different constructions.
p163
aa(lp164
VAn additional twist is that all of the constructions in English
p165
aVare used not only literally,
p166
aVbut in a quasi-metaphorical way.
p167
aVFor example, this construction, the dative,
p168
aVis used not only to transfer things,
p169
aVbut also for the metaphorical transfer of ideas,
p170
aVas when we say, "She told a story to me"
p171
aVor "told me a story,"
p172
aV"Max taught Spanish to the students" or "taught the students Spanish."
p173
aVIt's exactly the same construction,
p174
aVbut no muffins, no mice, nothing moving at all.
p175
aVIt evokes the container metaphor of communication,
p176
aVin which we conceive of ideas as objects,
p177
aVsentences as containers,
p178
aVand communication as a kind of sending.
p179
aVAs when we say we "gather" our ideas, to "put" them "into" words,
p180
aVand if our words aren't "empty" or "hollow,"
p181
aVwe might get these ideas "across" to a listener,
p182
aVwho can "unpack" our words to "extract" their "content."
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd indeed, this kind of verbiage is not the exception, but the rule.
p185
aVIt's very hard to find any example of abstract language
p186
aVthat is not based on some concrete metaphor.
p187
aVFor example, you can use the verb "go"
p188
aVand the prepositions "to" and "from"
p189
aVin a literal, spatial sense.
p190
aV"The messenger went from Paris to Istanbul."
p191
aVYou can also say, "Biff went from sick to well."
p192
aVHe needn't go anywhere. He could have been in bed the whole time,
p193
aVbut it's as if his health is a point in state space
p194
aVthat you conceptualize as moving.
p195
aVOr, "The meeting went from three to four,"
p196
aVin which we conceive of time as stretched along a line.
p197
aVLikewise, we use "force" to indicate
p198
aVnot only physical force,
p199
aVas in, "Rose forced the door to open,"
p200
aVbut also interpersonal force,
p201
aVas in, "Rose forced Sadie to go," not necessarily by manhandling her,
p202
aVbut by issuing a threat.
p203
aVOr, "Rose forced herself to go,"
p204
aVas if there were two entities inside Rose's head,
p205
aVengaged in a tug of a war.
p206
aa(lp207
VSecond conclusion is that the ability to conceive
p208
aVof a given event in two different ways,
p209
aVsuch as "cause something to go to someone"
p210
aVand "causing someone to have something,"
p211
aVI think is a fundamental feature of human thought,
p212
aVand it's the basis for much human argumentation,
p213
aVin which people don't differ so much on the facts
p214
aVas on how they ought to be construed.
p215
aVJust to give you a few examples:
p216
aV"ending a pregnancy" versus "killing a fetus;"
p217
aV"a ball of cells" versus "an unborn child;"
p218
aV"invading Iraq" versus "liberating Iraq;"
p219
aV"redistributing wealth" versus "confiscating earnings."
p220
aVAnd I think the biggest picture of all
p221
aVwould take seriously the fact
p222
aVthat so much of our verbiage about abstract events
p223
aVis based on a concrete metaphor
p224
aVand see human intelligence itself
p225
aVas consisting of a repertoire of concepts \u2014
p226
aVsuch as objects, space, time, causation and intention \u2014
p227
aVwhich are useful in a social, knowledge-intensive species,
p228
aVwhose evolution you can well imagine,
p229
aVand a process of metaphorical abstraction
p230
aVthat allows us to bleach these concepts
p231
aVof their original conceptual content \u2014
p232
aVspace, time and force \u2014
p233
aVand apply them to new abstract domains,
p234
aVtherefore allowing a species that evolved
p235
aVto deal with rocks and tools and animals,
p236
aVto conceptualize mathematics, physics, law
p237
aVand other abstract domains.
p238
aa(lp239
VWell, I said I'd talk about two windows on human nature \u2014
p240
aVthe cognitive machinery with which we conceptualize the world,
p241
aVand now I'm going to say a few words about the relationship types
p242
aVthat govern human social interaction,
p243
aVagain, as reflected in language.
p244
aVAnd I'll start out with a puzzle, the puzzle of indirect speech acts.
p245
aVNow, I'm sure most of you have seen the movie "Fargo."
p246
aVAnd you might remember the scene in which
p247
aVthe kidnapper is pulled over by a police officer,
p248
aVis asked to show his driver's license
p249
aVand holds his wallet out
p250
aVwith a 50-dollar bill extending
p251
aVat a slight angle out of the wallet.
p252
aVAnd he says, "I was just thinking
p253
aVthat maybe we could take care of it here in Fargo,"
p254
aVwhich everyone, including the audience,
p255
aVinterprets as a veiled bribe.
p256
aVThis kind of indirect speech is rampant in language.
p257
aVFor example, in polite requests,
p258
aVif someone says, "If you could pass the guacamole,
p259
aVthat would be awesome,"
p260
aVwe know exactly what he means,
p261
aVeven though that's a rather bizarre
p262
aVconcept being expressed.
p263
aa(lp264
V(Laughter)
p265
aa(lp266
V"Would you like to come up and see my etchings?"
p267
aVI think most people
p268
aVunderstand the intent behind that.
p269
aVAnd likewise, if someone says,
p270
aV"Nice store you've got there. It would be a real shame if something happened to it" \u2014
p271
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p272
aVwe understand that as a veiled threat,
p273
aVrather than a musing of hypothetical possibilities.
p274
aVSo the puzzle is, why are bribes,
p275
aVpolite requests, solicitations and threats so often veiled?
p276
aVNo one's fooled.
p277
aVBoth parties know exactly what the speaker means,
p278
aVand the speaker knows the listener knows
p279
aVthat the speaker knows that the listener knows, etc., etc.
p280
aVSo what's going on?
p281
aa(lp282
VI think the key idea is that language
p283
aVis a way of negotiating relationships,
p284
aVand human relationships fall into a number of types.
p285
aVThere's an influential taxonomy by the anthropologist Alan Fiske,
p286
aVin which relationships can be categorized, more or less,
p287
aVinto communality, which works on the principle
p288
aV"what's mine is thine, what's thine is mine,"
p289
aVthe kind of mindset that operates within a family, for example;
p290
aVdominance, whose principle is "don't mess with me;"
p291
aVreciprocity, "you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours;"
p292
aVand sexuality, in the immortal words of Cole Porter, "Let's do it."
p293
aa(lp294
VNow, relationship types can be negotiated.
p295
aVEven though there are default situations
p296
aVin which one of these mindsets can be applied,
p297
aVthey can be stretched and extended.
p298
aVFor example, communality applies most naturally
p299
aVwithin family or friends,
p300
aVbut it can be used to try to transfer
p301
aVthe mentality of sharing
p302
aVto groups that ordinarily would not be disposed to exercise it.
p303
aVFor example, in brotherhoods, fraternal organizations,
p304
aVsororities, locutions like "the family of man,"
p305
aVyou try to get people who are not related
p306
aVto use the relationship type that would ordinarily
p307
aVbe appropriate to close kin.
p308
aa(lp309
VNow, mismatches \u2014 when one person assumes one relationship type,
p310
aVand another assumes a different one \u2014 can be awkward.
p311
aVIf you went over and you helped yourself
p312
aVto a shrimp off your boss' plate,
p313
aVfor example, that would be an awkward situation.
p314
aVOr if a dinner guest after the meal
p315
aVpulled out his wallet and offered to pay you for the meal,
p316
aVthat would be rather awkward as well.
p317
aVIn less blatant cases,
p318
aVthere's still a kind of negotiation that often goes on.
p319
aVIn the workplace, for example,
p320
aVthere's often a tension over whether an employee
p321
aVcan socialize with the boss,
p322
aVor refer to him or her
p323
aVon a first-name basis.
p324
aVIf two friends have a
p325
aVreciprocal transaction, like selling a car,
p326
aVit's well known that this can be a source
p327
aVof tension or awkwardness.
p328
aVIn dating, the transition
p329
aVfrom friendship to sex
p330
aVcan lead to, notoriously, various forms of awkwardness,
p331
aVand as can sex in the workplace,
p332
aVin which we call the conflict between a
p333
aVdominant and a sexual relationship "sexual harassment."
p334
aa(lp335
VWell, what does this have to do with language?
p336
aVWell, language, as a social interaction,
p337
aVhas to satisfy two conditions.
p338
aVYou have to convey the actual content \u2014
p339
aVhere we get back to the container metaphor.
p340
aVYou want to express the bribe, the command, the promise,
p341
aVthe solicitation and so on,
p342
aVbut you also have to negotiate
p343
aVand maintain the kind of relationship
p344
aVyou have with the other person.
p345
aVThe solution, I think, is that we use language at two levels:
p346
aVthe literal form signals
p347
aVthe safest relationship with the listener,
p348
aVwhereas the implicated content \u2014
p349
aVthe reading between the lines that we count on the listener to perform \u2014
p350
aVallows the listener to derive the interpretation
p351
aVwhich is most relevant in context,
p352
aVwhich possibly initiates a changed relationship.
p353
aa(lp354
VThe simplest example of this is in the polite request.
p355
aVIf you express your request as a conditional \u2014
p356
aV"if you could open the window, that would be great" \u2014
p357
aVeven though the content is an imperative,
p358
aVthe fact that you're not using the imperative voice
p359
aVmeans that you're not acting as if you're in a relationship of dominance,
p360
aVwhere you could presuppose the compliance of the other person.
p361
aVOn the other hand, you want the damn guacamole.
p362
aVBy expressing it as an if-then statement,
p363
aVyou can get the message across
p364
aVwithout appearing to boss another person around.
p365
aa(lp366
VAnd in a more subtle way, I think, this works
p367
aVfor all of the veiled speech acts
p368
aVinvolving plausible deniability:
p369
aVthe bribes, threats, propositions,
p370
aVsolicitations and so on.
p371
aVOne way of thinking about it is to imagine what it would be like
p372
aVif language \u2014 where it could only be used literally.
p373
aVAnd you can think of it in terms of a
p374
aVgame-theoretic payoff matrix.
p375
aVPut yourself in the position of the
p376
aVkidnapper wanting to bribe the officer.
p377
aVThere's a high stakes
p378
aVin the two possibilities
p379
aVof having a dishonest officer or an honest officer.
p380
aVIf you don't bribe the officer,
p381
aVthen you will get a traffic ticket \u2014
p382
aVor, as is the case of "Fargo," worse \u2014
p383
aVwhether the honest officer
p384
aVis honest or dishonest.
p385
aVNothing ventured, nothing gained.
p386
aVIn that case, the consequences are rather severe.
p387
aVOn the other hand, if you extend the bribe,
p388
aVif the officer is dishonest,
p389
aVyou get a huge payoff of going free.
p390
aVIf the officer is honest, you get a huge penalty
p391
aVof being arrested for bribery.
p392
aVSo this is a rather fraught situation.
p393
aa(lp394
VOn the other hand, with indirect language,
p395
aVif you issue a veiled bribe,
p396
aVthen the dishonest officer
p397
aVcould interpret it as a bribe,
p398
aVin which case you get the payoff of going free.
p399
aVThe honest officer can't hold you to it as being a bribe,
p400
aVand therefore, you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket.
p401
aVSo you get the best of both worlds.
p402
aVAnd a similar analysis, I think,
p403
aVcan apply to the potential awkwardness
p404
aVof a sexual solicitation,
p405
aVand other cases where plausible deniability is an asset.
p406
aVI think this affirms
p407
aVsomething that's long been known by diplomats \u2014
p408
aVnamely, that the vagueness of language,
p409
aVfar from being a bug or an imperfection,
p410
aVactually might be a feature of language,
p411
aVone that we use to our advantage in social interactions.
p412
aa(lp413
VSo to sum up: language is a collective human creation,
p414
aVreflecting human nature,
p415
aVhow we conceptualize reality,
p416
aVhow we relate to one another.
p417
aVAnd then by analyzing the various quirks and complexities of language,
p418
aVI think we can get a window onto what makes us tick.
p419
aVThank you very much.

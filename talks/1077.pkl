VI'm speaking to you about what I call the "mesh."
p5
aVIt's essentially a fundamental shift
p6
aVin our relationship with stuff, with the things in our lives.
p7
aVAnd it's starting to look at \u2014
p8
aVnot always and not for everything \u2014
p9
aVbut in certain moments of time,
p10
aVaccess to certain kinds of goods and service
p11
aVwill trump ownership of them.
p12
aVAnd so it's the pursuit of better things,
p13
aVeasily shared.
p14
aVAnd we come from a long tradition of sharing.
p15
aVWe've shared transportation.
p16
aVWe've shared wine and food
p17
aVand other sorts of fabulous experiences
p18
aVin coffee bars in Amsterdam.
p19
aVWe've also shared other sorts of entertainment \u2014
p20
aVsports arenas, public parks,
p21
aVconcert halls, libraries,
p22
aVuniversities.
p23
aVAll these things are share-platforms,
p24
aVbut sharing ultimately starts and ends
p25
aVwith what I refer to
p26
aVas the "mother of all share-platforms."
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd as I think about the mesh
p29
aVand I think about, well, what's driving it,
p30
aVhow come it's happening now,
p31
aVI think there's a number of vectors
p32
aVthat I want to give you as background.
p33
aVOne is the recession \u2014
p34
aVthat the recession has caused us
p35
aVto rethink our relationship
p36
aVwith the things in our lives relative to the value \u2014
p37
aVso starting to align the value
p38
aVwith the true cost.
p39
aVSecondly, population growth
p40
aVand density into cities.
p41
aVMore people, smaller spaces,
p42
aVless stuff.
p43
aVClimate change:
p44
aVwe're trying to reduce the stress
p45
aVin our personal lives and in our communities
p46
aVand on the planet.
p47
aVAlso, there's been this recent distrust
p48
aVof big brands, global big brands,
p49
aVin a bunch of different industries,
p50
aVand that's created an opening.
p51
aVResearch is showing here, in the States,
p52
aVand in Canada and Western Europe,
p53
aVthat most of us are much more open
p54
aVto local companies,
p55
aVor brands that maybe we haven't heard of.
p56
aVWhereas before, we went with the big brands
p57
aVthat we were sure we trusted.
p58
aVAnd last is that
p59
aVwe're more connected now to more people on the planet
p60
aVthan ever before \u2014
p61
aVexcept for if you're sitting next to someone.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VThe other thing that's worth considering
p66
aVis that we've made a huge investment
p67
aVover decades and decades,
p68
aVand tens of billions of dollars
p69
aVhave gone into this investment
p70
aVthat now is our inheritance.
p71
aVIt's a physical infrastructure
p72
aVthat allows us to get from point A to point B
p73
aVand move things that way.
p74
aVIt's also \u2014 Web and mobile
p75
aVallow us to be connected
p76
aVand create all kinds of platforms and systems,
p77
aVand the investment of those technologies
p78
aVand that infrastructure
p79
aVis really our inheritance.
p80
aVIt allows us to engage
p81
aVin really new and interesting ways.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd so for me, a mesh company, the "classic" mesh company,
p84
aVbrings together these three things:
p85
aVour ability to connect to each other \u2014
p86
aVmost of us are walking around with these mobile devices
p87
aVthat are GPS-enabled and Web-enabled \u2014
p88
aVallows us to find each other
p89
aVand find things in time and space.
p90
aVAnd third is that physical things
p91
aVare readable on a map \u2014
p92
aVso restaurants, a variety of venues,
p93
aVbut also with GPS and other technology
p94
aVlike RFID
p95
aVand it continues to expand beyond that,
p96
aVwe can also track things that are moving,
p97
aVlike a car, a taxicab, a transit system,
p98
aVa box that's moving through time and space.
p99
aVAnd so that sets up
p100
aVfor making access to get goods and services
p101
aVmore convenient and less costly in many cases
p102
aVthan owning them.
p103
aa(lp104
VFor example, I want to use Zipcar.
p105
aVHow many people here have experienced
p106
aVcar-sharing or bike-sharing?
p107
aVWow, that's great. Okay, thank you.
p108
aVBasically Zipcar
p109
aVis the largest car-sharing company in the world.
p110
aVThey did not invent car-sharing.
p111
aVCar-sharing was actually invented in Europe.
p112
aVOne of the founders went to Switzerland,
p113
aVsaw it implemented someplace,
p114
aVsaid, "Wow, that looks really cool.
p115
aVI think we can do that in Cambridge,"
p116
aVbrought it to Cambridge
p117
aVand they started \u2014 two women \u2014
p118
aVRobin Chase being the other person who started it.
p119
aVZipcar got some really important things right.
p120
aVFirst, they really understood
p121
aVthat a brand is a voice and a product is a souvenir.
p122
aVAnd so they were very clever
p123
aVabout the way that they packaged car-sharing.
p124
aVThey made it sexy. They made it fresh.
p125
aVThey made it aspirational.
p126
aVIf you were a member of the club,
p127
aVwhen you're a member of a club, you're a Zipster.
p128
aVThe cars they picked didn't look like ex-cop cars
p129
aVthat were hollowed out or something.
p130
aVThey picked these sexy cars.
p131
aVThey targeted to universities.
p132
aVThey made sure that the demographic
p133
aVfor who they were targeting and the car was all matching.
p134
aVIt was a very nice experience,
p135
aVand the cars were clean and reliable, and it all worked.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd so from a branding perspective, they got a lot right.
p138
aVBut they understood fundamentally
p139
aVthat they are not a car company.
p140
aVThey understand that they are an information company.
p141
aVBecause when we buy a car
p142
aVwe go to the dealer once, we have an interaction, and we're chow \u2014
p143
aVusually as quickly as possible.
p144
aVBut when you're sharing a car and you have a car-share service,
p145
aVyou might use an E.V. to commute,
p146
aVyou get a truck because you're doing a home project.
p147
aVWhen you pick your aunt up at the airport, you get a sedan.
p148
aVAnd you're going to the mountains to ski,
p149
aVyou get different accessories put on the car
p150
aVfor doing that sort of thing.
p151
aVMeanwhile, these guys are sitting back,
p152
aVcollecting all sorts of data
p153
aVabout our behavior and how we interact with the service.
p154
aVAnd so it's not only an option for them,
p155
aVbut I believe it's an imperative
p156
aVfor Zipcar and other mesh companies
p157
aVto actually just wow us,
p158
aVto be like a concierge service.
p159
aVBecause we give them so much information,
p160
aVand they are entitled to really see
p161
aVhow it is that we're moving.
p162
aVThey're in really good shape to anticipate
p163
aVwhat we're going to want next.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd so what percent of the day
p166
aVdo you think the average person uses a car?
p167
aVWhat percentage of the time?
p168
aVAny guesses?
p169
aVThose are really very good.
p170
aVI was imagining it was like
p171
aV20 percent when I first started.
p172
aVThe number across the U.S. and Western Europe
p173
aVis eight percent.
p174
aVAnd so basically even if you think it's 10 percent,
p175
aV90 percent of the time,
p176
aVsomething that costs us a lot of money \u2014
p177
aVpersonally, and also we organize our cities around it
p178
aVand all sorts of things \u2014
p179
aV90 percent of the time it's sitting around.
p180
aVSo for this reason,
p181
aVI think one of the other themes with the mesh
p182
aVis essentially that, if we squeeze hard
p183
aVon things that we've thrown away,
p184
aVthere's a lot of value in those things.
p185
aVWhat set up with Zipcar \u2014 Zipcar started in 2000.
p186
aa(lp187
VIn the last year, 2010,
p188
aVtwo car companies started,
p189
aVone that's in the U.K. called WhipCar,
p190
aVand the other one, RelayRides, in the U.S.
p191
aVThey're both peer-to-peer car-sharing services,
p192
aVbecause the two things that really work for car-sharing
p193
aVis, one, the car has to be available,
p194
aVand two, it's within one or two blocks
p195
aVof where you stand.
p196
aVWell the car that's one or two blocks from your home or your office
p197
aVis probably your neighbor's car,
p198
aVand it's probably also available.
p199
aVSo people have created this business.
p200
aVZipcar started a decade earlier,
p201
aVin 2000.
p202
aVIt took them six years
p203
aVto get 1,000 cars in service.
p204
aVWhipCar, which started April of last year,
p205
aVit took them six months
p206
aVto get 1,000 cars in the service.
p207
aVSo, really interesting.
p208
aVPeople are making anywhere between
p209
aV200 and 700 dollars a month
p210
aVletting their neighbors use their car when they're not using it.
p211
aVSo it's like vacation rentals for cars.
p212
aVSince I'm here \u2014
p213
aVand I hope some people in the audience
p214
aVare in the car business \u2014
p215
aV(Laughter)
p216
aV\u2014 I'm thinking that, coming from the technology side of things \u2014
p217
aVwe saw cable-ready TVs
p218
aVand WiFi-ready Notebooks \u2014
p219
aVit would be really great if, any minute now,
p220
aVyou guys could start rolling share-ready cars off.
p221
aVBecause it just creates more flexibility.
p222
aVIt allows us as owners to have other options.
p223
aVAnd I think we're going there anyway.
p224
aa(lp225
VThe opportunity and the challenge with mesh businesses \u2014
p226
aVand those are businesses like Zipcar or Netflix
p227
aVthat are full mesh businesses,
p228
aVor other ones where you have a lot of the car companies,
p229
aVcar manufacturers,
p230
aVwho are beginning to offer
p231
aVtheir own car-share services
p232
aVas well as a second flanker brand,
p233
aVor as really a test, I think \u2014
p234
aVis to make sharing irresistible.
p235
aVWe have experiences in our lives, certainly,
p236
aVwhen sharing has been irresistible.
p237
aVIt's just, how do we make that recurrent
p238
aVand scale it?
p239
aVWe know also, because we're connected in social networks,
p240
aVthat it's easy to create delight
p241
aVin one little place.
p242
aVIt's contagious because we're all connected to each other.
p243
aVSo if I have a terrific experience
p244
aVand I tweet it, or I tell five people standing next to me, news travels.
p245
aVThe opposite, as we know, is also true,
p246
aVoften more true.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo here we have LudoTruck, which is in L.A.,
p249
aVdoing the things that gourmet food trucks do,
p250
aVand they've gathered quite a following.
p251
aVIn general, and maybe, again, it's because I'm a tech entrepreneur,
p252
aVI look at things as platforms.
p253
aVPlatforms are invitations.
p254
aVSo creating Craigslist
p255
aVor iTunes and the iPhone developer network,
p256
aVthere are all these networks \u2014 Facebook as well.
p257
aVThese platforms invite all sorts of developers
p258
aVand all sorts of people
p259
aVto come with their ideas and their opportunity
p260
aVto create and target an application
p261
aVfor a particular audience.
p262
aVAnd honestly, it's full of surprises.
p263
aVBecause I don't think any of us in this room
p264
aVcould have predicted the sorts of applications
p265
aVthat have happened at Facebook, around Facebook,
p266
aVfor example, two years ago,
p267
aVwhen Mark announced
p268
aVthat they were going to go with a platform.
p269
aa(lp270
VSo in this way, I think that cities are platforms,
p271
aVand certainly Detroit is a platform.
p272
aVThe invitation of bringing
p273
aVmakers and artists and entrepreneurs \u2014
p274
aVit really helps stimulate this fiery creativity
p275
aVand helps a city to thrive.
p276
aVIt's inviting participation,
p277
aVand cities have, historically,
p278
aVinvited all sorts of participation.
p279
aVNow we're saying that there's other options as well.
p280
aVSo, for example, city departments
p281
aVcan open up transit data.
p282
aVGoogle has made available transit data API.
p283
aVAnd so there's about seven or eight cities already in the U.S.
p284
aVthat have provided the transit data,
p285
aVand different developers are building applications.
p286
aVSo I was having a coffee in Portland,
p287
aVand half-of-a-latte in
p288
aVand the little board in the cafe
p289
aVall of a sudden starts showing me
p290
aVthat the next bus is coming in three minutes
p291
aVand the train is coming in 16 minutes.
p292
aVAnd so it's reliable, real data
p293
aVthat's right in my face, where I am,
p294
aVso I can finish the latte.
p295
aa(lp296
VThere's this fabulous opportunity we have across the U.S. now:
p297
aVabout 21 percent
p298
aVof vacant commercial and industrial space.
p299
aVThat space is not vital.
p300
aVThe areas around it lack vitality
p301
aVand vibrancy and engagement.
p302
aVThere's this thing \u2014 how many people here
p303
aVhave heard of pop-up stores or pop-up shops?
p304
aVOh, great. So I'm a big fan of this.
p305
aVAnd this is a very mesh-y thing.
p306
aVEssentially, there are all sorts
p307
aVof restaurants in Oakland, near where I live.
p308
aVThere's a pop-up general store every three weeks,
p309
aVand they do a fantastic job
p310
aVof making a very social event
p311
aVhappening for foodies.
p312
aVSuper fun, and it happens in a very transitional neighborhood.
p313
aVSubsequent to that,
p314
aVafter it's been going for about a year now,
p315
aVthey actually started to lease and create and extend.
p316
aVAn area that was edgy-artsy
p317
aVis now starting to become much cooler
p318
aVand engage a lot more people.
p319
aVSo this is an example.
p320
aVThe Crafty Fox is this woman who's into crafts,
p321
aVand she does these pop-up crafts fairs around London.
p322
aVBut these sorts of things are happening
p323
aVin many different environments.
p324
aVFrom my perspective, one of the things pop-up stores do
p325
aVis create perishability and urgency.
p326
aVIt creates two of the favorite words of any businessperson:
p327
aVsold out.
p328
aVAnd the opportunity to really focus trust and attention
p329
aVis a wonderful thing.
p330
aa(lp331
VSo a lot of what we see in the mesh,
p332
aVand a lot of what we have in the platform that we built
p333
aVallows us to define, refine and scale.
p334
aVIt allows us to test things as an entrepreneur,
p335
aVto go to market,
p336
aVto be in conversation with people,
p337
aVlisten, refine something and go back.
p338
aVIt's very cost-effective,
p339
aVand it's very mesh-y.
p340
aVThe infrastructure enables that.
p341
aa(lp342
VIn closing, and as we're moving towards the end,
p343
aVI just also want to encourage \u2014
p344
aVand I'm willing to share my failures as well,
p345
aVthough not from the stage.
p346
aV(Laughter)
p347
aVI would just like to say that one of the big things,
p348
aVwhen we look at waste
p349
aVand when we look at ways that we can really be generous
p350
aVand contribute to each other,
p351
aVbut also move to create a better economic situation
p352
aVand a better environmental situation,
p353
aVis by sharing failures.
p354
aVAnd one quick example
p355
aVis Velib, in 2007,
p356
aVcame forward in Paris
p357
aVwith a very bold proposition,
p358
aVa very big bike-sharing service.
p359
aVThey made a lot of mistakes.
p360
aVThey had some number of big successes.
p361
aVBut they were very transparent, or they had to be,
p362
aVin the way that they exposed
p363
aVwhat worked and didn't work.
p364
aVAnd so B.C. in Barcelona
p365
aVand B-cycle
p366
aVand Boris Bikes in London \u2014
p367
aVno one has had to repeat
p368
aVthe version 1.0 screw-ups
p369
aVand expensive learning exercises
p370
aVthat happened in Paris.
p371
aVSo the opportunity when we're connected
p372
aVis also to share failures and successes.
p373
aa(lp374
VWe're at the very beginning of something
p375
aVthat, what we're seeing
p376
aVand the way that mesh companies are coming forward,
p377
aVis inviting, it's engaging, but it's very early.
p378
aVI have a website \u2014 it's a directory \u2014
p379
aVand it started with about 1,200 companies,
p380
aVand in the last two-and-a-half months
p381
aVit's up to about 3,300 companies.
p382
aVAnd it grows on a very regular daily basis.
p383
aVBut it's very much at the beginning.
p384
aa(lp385
VSo I just want to welcome all of you onto the ride.
p386
aVAnd thank you very much.

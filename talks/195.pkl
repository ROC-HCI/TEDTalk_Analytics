VI want you to imagine that you're a student in my lab.
p5
aVWhat I want you to do is to create a biologically inspired design.
p6
aVAnd so here's the challenge:
p7
aVI want you to help me create a fully 3D, dynamic, parameterized contact model.
p8
aVThe translation of that is, could you help me build a foot?
p9
aVAnd it is a true challenge, and I do want you to help me.
p10
aVOf course, in the challenge there is a prize.
p11
aVIt's not quite the TED Prize, but it is an exclusive t-shirt from our lab.
p12
aVSo please send me your ideas about how to design a foot.
p13
aa(lp14
VNow if we want to design a foot, what do we have to do?
p15
aVWe have to first know what a foot is.
p16
aVIf we go to the dictionary, it says, "It's the lower extremity of a leg
p17
aVthat is in direct contact with the ground in standing or walking"
p18
aVThat's the traditional definition.
p19
aVBut if you wanted to really do research, what do you have to do?
p20
aVYou have to go to the literature and look up what's known about feet.
p21
aVSo you go to the literature. (Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VMaybe you're familiar with this literature.
p24
aVThe problem is, there are many, many feet.
p25
aVHow do you do this?
p26
aVYou need to survey all feet and extract the principles of how they work.
p27
aVAnd I want you to help me do that in this next clip.
p28
aVAs you see this clip, look for principles,
p29
aVand also think about experiments that you might design
p30
aVin order to understand how a foot works.
p31
aa(lp32
VSee any common themes? Principles?
p33
aVWhat would you do?
p34
aVWhat experiments would you run?
p35
aVWow. (Applause)
p36
aVOur research on the biomechanics of animal locomotion
p37
aVhas allowed us to make a blueprint for a foot.
p38
aVIt's a design inspired by nature, but it's not a copy of any specific foot you just looked at,
p39
aVbut it's a synthesis of the secrets of many, many feet.
p40
aa(lp41
VNow it turns out that animals can go anywhere.
p42
aVThey can locomote on substrates that vary as you saw \u2014
p43
aVin the probability of contact, the movement of that surface
p44
aVand the type of footholds that are present.
p45
aVIf you want to study how a foot works,
p46
aVwe're going to have to simulate those surfaces, or simulate that debris.
p47
aVWhen we did that, here's a new experiment that we did:
p48
aVwe put an animal and had it run \u2014 this grass spider \u2014
p49
aVon a surface with 99 percent of the contact area removed.
p50
aVBut it didn't even slow down the animal.
p51
aVIt's still running at the human equivalent of 300 miles per hour.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow how could it do that? Well, look more carefully.
p54
aVWhen we slow it down 50 times we see how the leg is hitting that simulated debris.
p55
aVThe leg is acting as a foot.
p56
aVAnd in fact, the animal contacts other parts of its leg
p57
aVmore frequently than the traditionally defined foot.
p58
aVThe foot is distributed along the whole leg.
p59
aVYou can do another experiment where you can take a cockroach with a foot,
p60
aVand you can remove its foot.
p61
aVI'm passing some cockroaches around. Take a look at their feet.
p62
aVWithout a foot, here's what it does. It doesn't even slow down.
p63
aVIt can run the same speed without even that segment.
p64
aVNo problem for the cockroach \u2014 they can grow them back, if you care.
p65
aVHow do they do it?
p66
aVLook carefully: this is slowed down 100 times,
p67
aVand watch what it's doing with the rest of its leg.
p68
aVIt's acting, again, as a distributed foot \u2014
p69
aVvery effective.
p70
aa(lp71
VNow, the question we had is, how general is a distributed foot?
p72
aVAnd the next behavior I'll show you of this animal just stunned us the first time that we saw it.
p73
aVJournalists, this is off the record; it's embargoed.
p74
aVTake a look at what that is!
p75
aVThat's a bipedal octopus that's disguised as a rolling coconut.
p76
aVIt was discovered by Christina Huffard
p77
aVand filmed by Sea Studios, right here from Monterey.
p78
aa(lp79
VWe've also described another species of bipedal octopus.
p80
aVThis one disguises itself as floating algae.
p81
aVIt walks on two legs and it holds the other arms up in the air so that it can't be seen.
p82
aV(Applause)
p83
aVAnd look what it does with its foot to get over challenging terrain.
p84
aVIt uses that beautiful distributed foot to make it as if those obstacles are not even there \u2014
p85
aVtruly extraordinary.
p86
aa(lp87
VIn 1951, Escher made this drawing. He thought he created an animal fantasy.
p88
aVBut we know that art imitates life,
p89
aVand it turns out nature, three million years ago, evolved the next animal.
p90
aVIt's a shrimp-like animal called the stomatopod,
p91
aVand here's how it moves on the beaches of Panama:
p92
aVit actually rolls, and it can even roll uphill.
p93
aVIt's the ultimate distributed foot: its whole body in this case is acting like its foot.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo, if we want to then, to our blueprint, add the first important feature,
p96
aVwe want to add distributed foot contact.
p97
aVNot just with the traditional foot, but also the leg,
p98
aVand even of the body.
p99
aVCan this help us inspire the design of novel robots?
p100
aVWe biologically inspired this robot, named RHex,
p101
aVbuilt by these extraordinary engineers over the last few years.
p102
aVRHex's foot started off to be quite simple,
p103
aVthen it got tuned over time, and ultimately resulted in this half circle.
p104
aVWhy is that? The video will show you.
p105
aVWatch where the robot, now, contacts its leg in order to deal with this very difficult terrain.
p106
aVWhat you'll see, in fact, is that it's using that half circle leg as a distributed foot.
p107
aVWatch it go over this.
p108
aVYou can see it here well on this debris.
p109
aVExtraordinary. No sensing, all the control is built right into the tuned legs.
p110
aVReally simple, but beautiful.
p111
aa(lp112
VNow, you might have noticed something else about the animals
p113
aVwhen they were running over the rough terrain.
p114
aVAnd my assistant's going to help me here.
p115
aVWhen you touched the cockroach leg \u2014 can you get the microphone for him?
p116
aVWhen you touched the cockroach leg, what did it feel like?
p117
aVDid you notice something?
p118
aa(lp119
VBoy: Spiny.
p120
aa(lp121
VRobert Full: It's spiny, right? It's really spiny, isn't it? It sort of hurts.
p122
aVMaybe we could give it to our curator and see if he'd be brave enough to touch the cockroach.
p123
aV(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
VChris Anderson: Did you touch it?
p126
aa(lp127
VRF: So if you look carefully at this, what you see is that they have spines
p128
aVand until a few weeks ago, no one knew what they did.
p129
aVThey assumed that they were for protection and for sensory structures.
p130
aVWe found that they're for something else \u2014 here's a segment of that spine.
p131
aVThey're tuned such that they easily collapse in one direction
p132
aVto pull the leg out from debris,
p133
aVbut they're stiff in the other direction so they capture disparities in the surface.
p134
aa(lp135
VNow crabs don't miss footholds, because they normally move on sand \u2014
p136
aVuntil they come to our lab.
p137
aVAnd where they have a problem with this kind of mesh,
p138
aVbecause they don't have spines.
p139
aVThe crabs are missing spines, so they have a problem in this kind of rough terrain.
p140
aVBut of course, we can deal with that
p141
aVbecause we can produce artificial spines.
p142
aVWe can make spines that catch on simulated debris
p143
aVand collapse on removal to easily pull them out.
p144
aVWe did that by putting these artificial spines on crabs,
p145
aVas you see here, and then we tested them.
p146
aVDo we really understand that principle of tuning? The answer is, yes!
p147
aVThis is slowed down 20-fold, and the crab just zooms across that simulated debris.
p148
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p149
aVA little better than nature.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo to our blueprint, we need to add tuned spines.
p152
aVNow will this help us think about the design of more effective climbing robots?
p153
aVWell, here's RHex: RHex has trouble on rails \u2014 on smooth rails, as you see here.
p154
aVSo why not add a spine? My colleagues did this at U. Penn.
p155
aVDan Koditschek put some steel nails \u2014 very simple version \u2014 on the robot,
p156
aVand here's RHex, now, going over those steel \u2014 those rails. No problem!
p157
aVHow does it do it?
p158
aVLet's slow it down and you can see the spines in action.
p159
aVWatch the leg come around, and you'll see it grab on right there.
p160
aVIt couldn't do that before; it would just slip and get stuck and tip over.
p161
aVAnd watch again, right there \u2014 successful.
p162
aa(lp163
VNow just because we have a distributed foot and spines
p164
aVdoesn't mean you can climb vertical surfaces.
p165
aVThis is really, really difficult.
p166
aVBut look at this animal do it!
p167
aVOne of the ones I'm passing around is climbing up this vertical surface that's a smooth metal plate.
p168
aVIt's extraordinary how fast it can do it \u2014
p169
aVbut if you slow it down, you see something that's quite extraordinary.
p170
aVIt's a secret. The animal effectively climbs by slipping and look \u2014
p171
aVand doing, actually, terribly, with respect to grabbing on the surface.
p172
aVIt looks, in fact, like it's swimming up the surface.
p173
aVWe can actually model that behavior better as a fluid, if you look at it.
p174
aVThe distributed foot, actually, is working more like a paddle.
p175
aa(lp176
VThe same is true when we looked at this lizard running on fluidized sand.
p177
aVWatch its feet.
p178
aVIt's actually functioning as a paddle
p179
aVeven though it's interacting with a surface that we normally think of as a solid.
p180
aVThis is not different from what my former undergraduate discovered
p181
aVwhen she figured out how lizards can run on water itself.
p182
aVCan you use this to make a better robot?
p183
aVMartin Buehler did \u2014 who's now at Boston Dynamics \u2014
p184
aVhe took this idea and made RHex to be Aqua RHex.
p185
aVSo here's RHex with paddles,
p186
aVnow converted into an incredibly maneuverable swimming robot.
p187
aa(lp188
VFor rough surfaces, though, animals add claws.
p189
aVAnd you probably feel them if you grabbed it.
p190
aVDid you touch it?
p191
aa(lp192
VCA: I did.
p193
aa(lp194
VRF: And they do really well at grabbing onto surfaces with these claws.
p195
aVMark Cutkosky at Stanford University, one of my collaborators, is an extraordinary engineer
p196
aVwho developed this technique called Shape Deposition Manufacturing,
p197
aVwhere he can imbed claws right into an artificial foot.
p198
aVAnd here's the simple version of a foot for a new robot that I'll show you in a bit.
p199
aVSo to our blueprint, let's attach claws.
p200
aVNow if we look at animals, though, to be really maneuverable in all surfaces,
p201
aVthe animals use hybrid mechanisms
p202
aVthat include claws, and spines, and hairs, and pads, and glue, and capillary adhesion
p203
aVand a whole bunch of other things.
p204
aVThese are all from different insects.
p205
aVThere's an ant crawling up a vertical surface.
p206
aVLet's look at that ant.
p207
aa(lp208
VThis is the foot of an ant. You see the hairs and the claws and this thing here.
p209
aVThis is when its foot's in the air.
p210
aVWatch what happens when the foot goes onto your sandwich.
p211
aVYou see what happens?
p212
aVThat pad comes out. And that's where the glue is.
p213
aVHere from underneath is an ant foot,
p214
aVand when the claws don't dig in, that pad automatically comes out without the ant doing anything.
p215
aVIt just extrudes.
p216
aVAnd this was a hard shot to get \u2014 I think this is the shot of the ant foot on the superstrings.
p217
aVSo it's pretty tough to do.
p218
aVThis is what it looks like close up \u2014
p219
aVhere's the ant foot, and there's the glue.
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd we discovered this glue may be an interesting two-phase mixture.
p222
aVIt certainly helps it to hold on.
p223
aVSo to our blueprint, we stick on some sticky pads.
p224
aVNow you might think for smooth surfaces we get inspiration here.
p225
aVNow we have something better here.
p226
aVThe gecko's a really great example of nanotechnology in nature.
p227
aVThese are its feet.
p228
aVThey're \u2014 almost look alien. And the secret, which they stick on with,
p229
aVinvolves their hairy toes.
p230
aVThey can run up a surface at a meter per second,
p231
aVtake 30 steps in that one second \u2014 you can hardly see them.
p232
aVIf we slow it down, they attach their feet at eight milliseconds,
p233
aVand detach them in 16 milliseconds.
p234
aVAnd when you watch how they detach it, it is bizarre.
p235
aVThey peel away from the surface like you'd peel away a piece of tape.
p236
aVVery strange. How do they stick?
p237
aa(lp238
VIf you look at their feet, they have leaf-like structures called linalae
p239
aVwith millions of hairs.
p240
aVAnd each hair has the worst case of split ends possible.
p241
aVIt has a hundred to a thousand split ends,
p242
aVand that's the secret, because it allows intimate contact.
p243
aVThe gecko has a billion of these 200-nanometer-sized split ends.
p244
aVAnd they don't stick by glue, or they don't work like Velcro, or they don't work with suction.
p245
aVWe discovered they work by intermolecular forces alone.
p246
aVSo to our blueprint, we split some hairs.
p247
aVThis has inspired the design of the first self-cleaning dry adhesive \u2014
p248
aVthe patent issued, we're happy to say.
p249
aVAnd here's the simplest version in nature,
p250
aVand here's my collaborator Ron Fearing's attempt
p251
aVat an artificial version of this dry adhesive made from polyurethane.
p252
aVAnd here's the first attempt to have it work on some load.
p253
aa(lp254
VThere's enormous interest in this in a variety of different fields.
p255
aVYou could think of a thousand possible uses, I'm sure.
p256
aVLots of people have, and we're excited about realizing this as a product.
p257
aVWe have imagined products; for example, this one:
p258
aVwe imagined a bio-inspired Band-Aid, where we took the glue off the Band-Aid.
p259
aVWe took some hairs from a molting gecko;
p260
aVput three rolls of them on here, and then made this Band-Aid.
p261
aa(lp262
VThis is an undergraduate volunteer \u2014
p263
aVwe have 30,000 undergraduates so we can choose among them \u2014
p264
aVthat's actually just a red pen mark.
p265
aVBut it makes an incredible Band-Aid.
p266
aVIt's aerated, it can be peeled off easily, it doesn't cause any irritation, it works underwater.
p267
aVI think this is an extraordinary example of how curiosity-based research \u2014
p268
aVwe just wondered how they climbed up something \u2014
p269
aVcan lead to things that you could never imagine.
p270
aVIt's just an example of why we need to support curiosity-based research.
p271
aVHere you are, pulling off the Band-Aid.
p272
aa(lp273
VSo we've redefined, now, what a foot is.
p274
aVThe question is, can we use these secrets, then,
p275
aVto inspire the design of a better foot, better than one that we see in nature?
p276
aVHere's the new project:
p277
aVwe're trying to create the first climbing search-and-rescue robot \u2014 no suction or magnets \u2014
p278
aVthat can only move on limited kinds of surfaces.
p279
aVI call the new robot RiSE, for "Robot in Scansorial Environment" \u2014 that's a climbing environment \u2014
p280
aVand we have an extraordinary team of biologists and engineers creating this robot.
p281
aVAnd here is RiSE.
p282
aVIt's six-legged and has a tail. Here it is on a fence and a tree.
p283
aVAnd here are RiSE's first steps on an incline.
p284
aVYou have the audio? You can hear it go up.
p285
aVAnd here it is coming up at you, in its first steps up a wall.
p286
aVNow it's only using its simplest feet here, so this is very new.
p287
aVBut we think we got the dynamics right of the robot.
p288
aa(lp289
VMark Cutkosky, though, is taking it a step further.
p290
aVHe's the one able to build this shape-deposition manufactured feet and toes.
p291
aVThe next step is to make compliant toes,
p292
aVand try to add spines and claws and set it for dry adhesives.
p293
aVSo the idea is to first get the toes and a foot right,
p294
aVattempt to make that climb, and ultimately put it on the robot.
p295
aVAnd that's exactly what he's done.
p296
aVHe's built, in fact, a climbing foot-bot inspired by nature.
p297
aa(lp298
VAnd here's Cutkosky's and his amazing students' design.
p299
aVSo these are tuned toes \u2014 there are six of them,
p300
aVand they use the principles that I just talked about collectively for the blueprint.
p301
aVSo this is not using any suction, any glue,
p302
aVand it will ultimately, when it's attached to the robot \u2014
p303
aVit's as biologically inspired as the animal \u2014
p304
aVhopefully be able to climb any kind of a surface.
p305
aVHere you see it, next, going up the side of a building at Stanford.
p306
aVIt's sped up \u2014 again, it's a foot climbing.
p307
aVIt's not the whole robot yet, we're working on it \u2014
p308
aVnow you can see how it's attaching.
p309
aVThese tuned structures allow the spines, friction pads and ultimately the adhesive hairs
p310
aVto grab onto very challenging, difficult surfaces.
p311
aVAnd so they were able to get this thing \u2014 this is now sped up 20 times \u2014
p312
aVcan you imagine it trying to go up and rescue somebody at that upper floor? OK?
p313
aVYou can visualize this now; it's not impossible.
p314
aVIt's a very challenging task. But more to come later.
p315
aa(lp316
VTo finish: we've gotten design secrets from nature by looking at how feet are built.
p317
aVWe've learned we should distribute control to smart parts.
p318
aVDon't put it all in the brain,
p319
aVbut put some of the control in tuned feet, legs and even body.
p320
aVThat nature uses hybrid solutions, not a single solution, to these problems,
p321
aVand they're integrated and beautifully robust.
p322
aVAnd third, we believe strongly that we do not want to mimic nature but instead be inspired by biology,
p323
aVand use these novel principles with the best engineering solutions that are out there
p324
aVto make \u2014 potentially \u2014 something better than nature.
p325
aa(lp326
VSo there's a clear message:
p327
aVwhether you care about a fundamental, basic research
p328
aVof really interesting, bizarre, wonderful animals,
p329
aVor you want to build a search-and-rescue robot
p330
aVthat can help you in an earthquake, or to save someone in a fire,
p331
aVor you care about medicine, we must preserve nature's designs.
p332
aVOtherwise these secrets will be lost forever.
p333
aVThank you.

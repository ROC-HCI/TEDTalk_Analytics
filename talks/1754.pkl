VHow many of you have checked your email today?
p5
aVCome on, raise your hands.
p6
aVHow many of you are checking it right now?
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VAnd how about finances? Anybody check that today?
p11
aVCredit card, investment account?
p12
aVHow about this week?
p13
aa(lp14
VNow, how about your household energy use?
p15
aVAnybody check that today?
p16
aVThis week? Last week?
p17
aVA few energy geeks spread out across the room.
p18
aVIt's good to see you guys.
p19
aVBut the rest of us \u2014 this is a room filled with people
p20
aVwho are passionate about the future of this planet,
p21
aVand even we aren't paying attention
p22
aVto the energy use that's driving climate change.
p23
aVThe woman in the photo with me is Harriet.
p24
aVWe met her on our first family vacation.
p25
aVHarriet's paying attention to her energy use,
p26
aVand she is decidedly not an energy geek.
p27
aVThis is the story of how Harriet came to pay attention.
p28
aa(lp29
VThis is coal,
p30
aVthe most common source of electricity on the planet,
p31
aVand there's enough energy in this coal
p32
aVto light this bulb for more than a year.
p33
aVBut unfortunately, between here and here,
p34
aVmost of that energy is lost to things
p35
aVlike transmission leakage and heat.
p36
aVIn fact, only 10 percent ends up as light.
p37
aVSo this coal will last a little bit more than a month.
p38
aVIf you wanted to light this bulb for a year,
p39
aVyou'd need this much coal.
p40
aVThe bad news here is that, for every unit of energy we use,
p41
aVwe waste nine.
p42
aVThat means there's good news,
p43
aVbecause for every unit of energy we save,
p44
aVwe save the other nine.
p45
aVSo the question is, how can we get the people in this room
p46
aVand across the globe to start paying attention
p47
aVto the energy we're using,
p48
aVand start wasting less of it?
p49
aa(lp50
VThe answer comes from a behavioral science experiment
p51
aVthat was run one hot summer, 10 years ago,
p52
aVand only 90 miles from here,
p53
aVin San Marcos, California.
p54
aVGraduate students put signs on every door in a neighborhood,
p55
aVasking people to turn off their air conditioning
p56
aVand turn on their fans.
p57
aVOne quarter of the homes received a message that said,
p58
aVdid you know you could save 54 dollars a month this summer?
p59
aVTurn off your air conditioning, turn on your fans.
p60
aVAnother group got an environmental message.
p61
aVAnd still a third group got a message about
p62
aVbeing good citizens, preventing blackouts.
p63
aVMost people guessed that money-saving message would work best of all.
p64
aVIn fact, none of these messages worked.
p65
aVThey had zero impact on energy consumption.
p66
aVIt was as if the grad students hadn't shown up at all.
p67
aa(lp68
VBut there was a fourth message,
p69
aVand this message simply said,
p70
aV"When surveyed, 77 percent of your neighbors
p71
aVsaid that they turned off their air conditioning and turned on their fans.
p72
aVPlease join them. Turn off your air conditioning
p73
aVand turn on your fans."
p74
aVAnd wouldn't you know it, they did.
p75
aVThe people who received this message
p76
aVshowed a marked decrease in energy consumption
p77
aVsimply by being told what their neighbors were doing.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo what does this tell us?
p80
aVWell, if something is inconvenient,
p81
aVeven if we believe in it,
p82
aVmoral suasion, financial incentives, don't do much to move us \u2014
p83
aVbut social pressure, that's powerful stuff.
p84
aVAnd harnessed correctly, it can be a powerful force for good.
p85
aVIn fact, it already is.
p86
aa(lp87
VInspired by this insight, my friend Dan Yates and I
p88
aVstarted a company called Opower.
p89
aVWe built software and partnered with utility companies
p90
aVwho wanted to help their customers save energy.
p91
aVWe deliver personalized home energy reports
p92
aVthat show people how their consumption
p93
aVcompares to their neighbors in similar-sized homes.
p94
aVJust like those effective door hangers,
p95
aVwe have people comparing themselves to their neighbors,
p96
aVand then we give everyone targeted recommendations
p97
aVto help them save.
p98
aVWe started with paper, we moved to a mobile application,
p99
aVweb, and now even a controllable thermostat,
p100
aVand for the last five years we've been running
p101
aVthe largest behavioral science experiment in the world.
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd it's working.
p104
aVOrdinary homeowners and renters have saved
p105
aVmore than 250 million dollars on their energy bills,
p106
aVand we're just getting started.
p107
aVThis year alone, in partnership with more than 80 utilities
p108
aVin six countries, we're going to generate
p109
aVanother two terawatt hours of electricity savings.
p110
aa(lp111
VNow, the energy geeks in the room know two terawatt hours,
p112
aVbut for the rest of us, two terawatt hours
p113
aVis more than enough energy to power every home
p114
aVin St. Louis and Salt Lake City combined
p115
aVfor more than a year.
p116
aVTwo terawatt hours, it's roughly half
p117
aVwhat the U.S. solar industry produced last year.
p118
aVAnd two terawatt hours? In terms of coal,
p119
aVwe'd need to burn 34 of these wheelbarrows
p120
aVevery minute around the clock every day for an entire year
p121
aVto get two terawatt hours of electricity.
p122
aVAnd we're not burning anything.
p123
aVWe're just motivating people to pay attention
p124
aVand change their behavior.
p125
aa(lp126
VBut we're just one company, and this is just
p127
aVscratching the surface.
p128
aVTwenty percent of the electricity in homes is wasted,
p129
aVand when I say wasted, I don't mean that people have
p130
aVinefficient lightbulbs. They may.
p131
aVI mean we leave the lights on in empty rooms,
p132
aVand we leave the air conditioning on when nobody's home.
p133
aVThat's 40 billion dollars a year wasted
p134
aVon electricity that does not contribute to our well-being
p135
aVbut does contribute to climate change.
p136
aVThat's 40 billion \u2014 with a B \u2014
p137
aVevery year in the U.S. alone.
p138
aVThat's half our coal usage right there.
p139
aa(lp140
VNow thankfully, some of the world's best material scientists
p141
aVare looking to replace coal with sustainable resources
p142
aVlike these,
p143
aVand this is both fantastic and essential.
p144
aVBut the most overlooked resource to get us
p145
aVto a sustainable energy future, it isn't on this slide.
p146
aVIt's in this room. It's you, and it's me.
p147
aVAnd we can harness this resource
p148
aVwith no new material science
p149
aVsimply by applying behavioral science.
p150
aVWe can do it today, we know it works,
p151
aVand it will save us money right away.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo what are we waiting for?
p154
aVWell, in most places, utility regulation
p155
aVhasn't changed much since Thomas Edison.
p156
aVUtilities are still rewarded when their customers
p157
aVwaste energy.
p158
aVThey ought to be rewarded for helping their customers save it.
p159
aa(lp160
VBut this story is much more than about household energy use.
p161
aVTake a look at the Prius.
p162
aVIt's efficient not only because Toyota invested in material science
p163
aVbut because they invested in behavioral science.
p164
aVThe dashboard that shows drivers how much energy
p165
aVthey're saving in real time
p166
aVmakes former speed demons
p167
aVdrive more like cautious grandmothers.
p168
aa(lp169
VWhich brings us back to Harriet.
p170
aVWe met her on our first family vacation.
p171
aVShe came over to meet my young daughter,
p172
aVand she was tickled to learn that my daughter's name
p173
aVis also Harriet.
p174
aVShe asked me what I did for a living,
p175
aVand I told her, I work with utilities
p176
aVto help people save energy.
p177
aVIt was then that her eyes lit up.
p178
aa(lp179
VShe looked at me, and she said,
p180
aV"You're exactly the person I need to talk to.
p181
aVYou see, two weeks ago, my husband and I got a letter
p182
aVin the mail from our utility.
p183
aVIt told us we were using twice as much energy as our neighbors."
p184
aV(Laughter)
p185
aV"And for the last two weeks, all we can think about,
p186
aVtalk about, and even argue about,
p187
aVis what we should be doing to save energy.
p188
aVWe did everything that letter told us to do,
p189
aVand still I know there must be more.
p190
aVNow I'm here with a genuine expert.
p191
aVTell me. What should I do to save energy?"
p192
aa(lp193
VThere are many experts who can help answer Harriet's question.
p194
aVMy goal is to make sure
p195
aVwe are all asking it.
p196
aa(lp197
VThank you.

VSo imagine that a plane is about to crash
p5
aVwith 250 children and babies,
p6
aVand if you knew how to stop that, would you?
p7
aa(lp8
VNow imagine
p9
aVthat 60 planes full of babies under five
p10
aVcrash every single day.
p11
aVThat's the number of kids
p12
aVthat never make it to their fifth birthday.
p13
aV6.6 million children
p14
aVnever make it to their fifth birthday.
p15
aa(lp16
VMost of these deaths are preventable,
p17
aVand that doesn't just make me sad,
p18
aVit makes me angry,
p19
aVand it makes me determined.
p20
aVDiarrhea and pneumonia
p21
aVare among the top two killers
p22
aVof children under five,
p23
aVand what we can do to prevent these diseases
p24
aVisn't some smart,
p25
aVnew technological innovations.
p26
aVIt's one of the world's oldest inventions:
p27
aVa bar of soap.
p28
aVWashing hands with soap,
p29
aVa habit we all take for granted,
p30
aVcan reduce diarrhea by half,
p31
aVcan reduce respiratory infections by one third.
p32
aVHandwashing with soap
p33
aVcan have an impact
p34
aVon reducing flu, trachoma, SARS,
p35
aVand most recently in the case of cholera
p36
aVand Ebola outbreak,
p37
aVone of the key interventions
p38
aVis handwashing with soap.
p39
aVHandwashing with soap keeps kids in school.
p40
aVIt stops babies from dying.
p41
aVHandwashing with soap
p42
aVis one of the most cost-effective
p43
aVways of saving children's lives.
p44
aVIt can save over 600,000 children every year.
p45
aVThat's the equivalent of stopping
p46
aV10 jumbo jets
p47
aVfull of babies and children
p48
aVfrom crashing every single day.
p49
aVI think you'll agree with me that that's a pretty
p50
aVuseful public health intervention.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo now just take a minute.
p53
aVI think you need to get to know the person next to you.
p54
aVWhy don't you just shake their hands.
p55
aVPlease shake their hands.
p56
aVAll right, get to know each other.
p57
aVThey look really pretty.
p58
aVAll right.
p59
aVSo what if I told you
p60
aVthat the person whose hands you just shook
p61
aVactually didn't wash their hands
p62
aVwhen they were coming out of the toilet? (Laughter)
p63
aVThey don't look so pretty anymore, right?
p64
aVPretty yucky, you would agree with me.
p65
aa(lp66
VWell, statistics are actually showing
p67
aVthat four people out of five
p68
aVdon't wash their hands when they come out of the toilet,
p69
aVglobally.
p70
aVAnd the same way,
p71
aVwe don't do it when we've got fancy toilets,
p72
aVrunning water, and soap available,
p73
aVit's the same thing in the countries
p74
aVwhere child mortality is really high.
p75
aa(lp76
VWhat is it? Is there no soap?
p77
aVActually, soap is available.
p78
aVIn 90 percent of households in India,
p79
aV94 percent of households in Kenya,
p80
aVyou will find soap.
p81
aVEven in countries where soap is the lowest,
p82
aVlike Ethiopia, we are at 50 percent.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo why is it?
p85
aVWhy aren't people washing their hands?
p86
aVWhy is it that Mayank,
p87
aVthis young boy that I met in India,
p88
aVisn't washing his hands?
p89
aVWell, in Mayank's family,
p90
aVsoap is used for bathing,
p91
aVsoap is used for laundry,
p92
aVsoap is used for washing dishes.
p93
aVHis parents think sometimes
p94
aVit's a precious commodity,
p95
aVso they'll keep it in a cupboard.
p96
aVThey'll keep it away from him so he doesn't waste it.
p97
aVOn average, in Mayank's family,
p98
aVthey will use soap for washing hands
p99
aVonce a day
p100
aVat the very best, and sometimes
p101
aVeven once a week for washing hands with soap.
p102
aVWhat's the result of that?
p103
aVChildren pick up disease
p104
aVin the place that's supposed to love them
p105
aVand protect them the most, in their homes.
p106
aa(lp107
VThink about where you learned to wash your hands.
p108
aVDid you learn to wash your hands at home?
p109
aVDid you learn to wash your hands in school?
p110
aVI think behavioral scientists will tell you
p111
aVthat it's very difficult to change the habits
p112
aVthat you have had early in life.
p113
aa(lp114
VHowever, we all copy what everyone else does,
p115
aVand local cultural norms are something
p116
aVthat shape how we change our behavior,
p117
aVand this is where the private sector comes in.
p118
aVEvery second in Asia and Africa,
p119
aV111 mothers
p120
aVwill buy this bar to protect their family.
p121
aVMany women in India will tell you
p122
aVthey learned all about hygiene, diseases,
p123
aVfrom this bar of soap from Lifebuoy brand.
p124
aVIconic brands like this one
p125
aVhave a responsibility to do good
p126
aVin the places where they sell their products.
p127
aVIt's that belief, plus the scale of Unilever,
p128
aVthat allows us to keep talking about
p129
aVhandwashing with soap and hygiene to these mothers.
p130
aa(lp131
VBig businesses and brands can change
p132
aVand shift those social norms
p133
aVand make a difference for those habits
p134
aVthat are so stubborn.
p135
aVThink about it:
p136
aVMarketeers spend all their time
p137
aVmaking us switch from one brand to the other.
p138
aVAnd actually, they know how to transform
p139
aVscience and facts into compelling messages.
p140
aVJust for a minute, imagine
p141
aVwhen they put all their forces behind
p142
aVa message as powerful as handwashing with soap.
p143
aVThe profit motive is transforming health outcomes
p144
aVin this world.
p145
aa(lp146
VBut it's been happening for centuries:
p147
aVthe Lifebuoy brand was launched in 1894
p148
aVin Victorian England
p149
aVto actually combat cholera.
p150
aVLast week, I was in Ghana
p151
aVwith the minister of health,
p152
aVbecause if you don't know,
p153
aVthere's a cholera outbreak in Ghana at the moment.
p154
aVA hundred and eighteen years later,
p155
aVthe solution is exactly the same:
p156
aVIt's about ensuring that they have access
p157
aVto this bar of soap,
p158
aVand that they're using it,
p159
aVbecause that's the number one way
p160
aVto actually stop cholera from spreading.
p161
aVI think this drive for profit
p162
aVis extremely powerful,
p163
aVsometimes more powerful than
p164
aVthe most committed charity or government.
p165
aa(lp166
VGovernment is doing what they can,
p167
aVespecially in terms of the pandemics
p168
aVand epidemics such as cholera,
p169
aVor Ebola at the moment,
p170
aVbut with competing priorities.
p171
aVThe budget is not always there.
p172
aVAnd when you think about this,
p173
aVyou think about what is required
p174
aVto make handwashing a daily habit,
p175
aVit requires sustained funding
p176
aVto refine this behavior.
p177
aVIn short, those that fight for public health
p178
aVare actually dependent upon the soap companies
p179
aVto keep promoting handwashing with soap.
p180
aVWe have friends like USAID,
p181
aVthe Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap,
p182
aVLondon School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,
p183
aVPlan, WaterAid,
p184
aVthat all believe
p185
aVfor a win-win-win partnership.
p186
aVWin for the public sector,
p187
aVbecause we help them reach their targets.
p188
aVWin for the private sector,
p189
aVbecause we build new generations
p190
aVof future handwashers.
p191
aVAnd most importantly,
p192
aVwin for the most vulnerable.
p193
aVOn October 15,
p194
aVwe will celebrate Global Handwashing Day.
p195
aVSchools, communities,
p196
aVour friends in the public sector
p197
aVand our friends in the private sector \u2014
p198
aVyes, on that day even our competitors,
p199
aVwe all join hands to celebrate
p200
aVthe world's most important
p201
aVpublic health intervention.
p202
aVWhat's required,
p203
aVand again where the private sector can make a huge difference,
p204
aVis coming up with this big, creative thinking
p205
aVthat drives advocacy.
p206
aVIf you take our Help a Child Reach 5 campaign,
p207
aVwe've created great films
p208
aVthat bring the message of handwashing with soap
p209
aVto the everyday person
p210
aVin a way that can relate to them.
p211
aVWe've had over 30 million views.
p212
aVMost of these discussions are still happening online.
p213
aVI urge you to take five minutes
p214
aVand look at those films.
p215
aa(lp216
VI come from Mali,
p217
aVone of the world's poorest countries.
p218
aVI grew up in a family where every dinner conversation
p219
aVwas around social justice.
p220
aVI trained in Europe's premier school of public health.
p221
aVI think I'm probably one of the only women
p222
aVin my country with this high degree in health,
p223
aVand the only one
p224
aVwith a doctorate in handwashing with soap.
p225
aV(Laughter)
p226
aV(Applause)
p227
aa(lp228
VNine years ago, I decided,
p229
aVwith a successful public health career in the making,
p230
aVthat I could make the biggest impact coming,
p231
aVselling and promoting the world's best invention
p232
aVin public health: soap.
p233
aVWe run today the world's largest
p234
aVhandwashing program
p235
aVby any public health standards.
p236
aVWe've reached over 183 million people
p237
aVin 16 countries.
p238
aVMy team and I have the ambition
p239
aVto reach one billion by 2020.
p240
aVOver the last four years,
p241
aVbusiness has grown double digits,
p242
aVwhilst child mortality has reduced
p243
aVin all the places where soap use has increased.
p244
aVIt may be uncomfortable for some to hear \u2014
p245
aVbusiness growth and lives saved
p246
aVsomehow equated in the same sentence \u2014
p247
aVbut it is that business growth
p248
aVthat allows us to keep doing more.
p249
aVWithout it, and without talking about it,
p250
aVwe cannot achieve the change that we need.
p251
aa(lp252
VLast week, my team and I
p253
aVspent time visiting mothers
p254
aVthat have all experienced the same thing:
p255
aVthe death of a newborn.
p256
aVI'm a mom. I can't imagine anything more powerful
p257
aVand more painful.
p258
aVThis one is from Myanmar.
p259
aVShe had the most beautiful smile,
p260
aVthe smile, I think, that life gives you
p261
aVwhen you've had a second chance.
p262
aVHer son, Myo, is her second one.
p263
aVShe had a daughter
p264
aVwho passed away at three weeks,
p265
aVand we know that the majority
p266
aVof children that actually die
p267
aVdie in the first month of their life,
p268
aVand we know that if we give a bar of soap
p269
aVto every skilled birth attendant,
p270
aVand that if soap is used  before touching the babies,
p271
aVwe can reduce and make a change
p272
aVin terms of those numbers.
p273
aVAnd that's what inspires me,
p274
aVinspires me to continue in this mission,
p275
aVto know that I can equip her
p276
aVwith what's needed
p277
aVso that she can do
p278
aVthe most beautiful job in the world:
p279
aVnurturing her newborn.
p280
aVAnd next time you think of a gift
p281
aVfor a new mom and her family,
p282
aVdon't look far: buy her soap.
p283
aVIt's the most beautiful invention in public health.
p284
aa(lp285
VI hope you will join us
p286
aVand make handwashing part of your daily lives
p287
aVand our daily lives
p288
aVand help more children like Myo
p289
aVreach their fifth birthday.
p290
aa(lp291
VThank you.

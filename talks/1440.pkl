VWell when I was asked to do this TEDTalk, I was really chuckled,
p5
aVbecause, you see, my father's name was Ted,
p6
aVand much of my life, especially my musical life,
p7
aVis really a talk that I'm still having with him,
p8
aVor the part of me that he continues to be.
p9
aa(lp10
VNow Ted was a New Yorker, an all-around theater guy,
p11
aVand he was a self-taught illustrator and musician.
p12
aVHe didn't read a note,
p13
aVand he was profoundly hearing impaired.
p14
aVYet, he was my greatest teacher.
p15
aVBecause even through the squeaks of his hearing aids,
p16
aVhis understanding of music was profound.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd for him, it wasn't so much the way the music goes
p19
aVas about what it witnesses and where it can take you.
p20
aVAnd he did a painting of this experience,
p21
aVwhich he called "In the Realm of Music."
p22
aVNow Ted entered this realm every day by improvising
p23
aVin a sort of Tin Pan Alley style like this.
p24
aV(Music)
p25
aa(lp26
VBut he was tough when it came to music.
p27
aVHe said, "There are only two things that matter in music:
p28
aVwhat and how.
p29
aVAnd the thing about classical music,
p30
aVthat what and how, it's inexhaustible."
p31
aa(lp32
VThat was his passion for the music.
p33
aVBoth my parents really loved it.
p34
aVThey didn't know all that much about it,
p35
aVbut they gave me the opportunity to discover it
p36
aVtogether with them.
p37
aVAnd I think inspired by that memory,
p38
aVit's been my desire to try and bring it
p39
aVto as many other people as I can,
p40
aVsort of pass it on through whatever means.
p41
aVAnd how people get this music, how it comes into their lives,
p42
aVreally fascinates me.
p43
aa(lp44
VOne day in New York, I was on the street
p45
aVand I saw some kids playing baseball between stoops and cars and fire hydrants.
p46
aVAnd a tough, slouchy kid got up to bat,
p47
aVand he took a swing and really connected.
p48
aVAnd he watched the ball fly for a second,
p49
aVand then he went, "Dah dadaratatatah.
p50
aVBrah dada dadadadah."
p51
aVAnd he ran around the bases.
p52
aVAnd I thought, go figure.
p53
aVHow did this piece of 18th century Austrian aristocratic entertainment
p54
aVturn into the victory crow of this New York kid?
p55
aVHow was that passed on? How did he get to hear Mozart?
p56
aa(lp57
VWell when it comes to classical music,
p58
aVthere's an awful lot to pass on,
p59
aVmuch more than Mozart, Beethoven or Tchiakovsky.
p60
aVBecause classical music
p61
aVis an unbroken living tradition
p62
aVthat goes back over 1,000 years.
p63
aVAnd every one of those years
p64
aVhas had something unique and powerful to say to us
p65
aVabout what it's like to be alive.
p66
aa(lp67
VNow the raw material of it, of course,
p68
aVis just the music of everyday life.
p69
aVIt's all the anthems and dance crazes
p70
aVand ballads and marches.
p71
aVBut what classical music does
p72
aVis to distill all of these musics down,
p73
aVto condense them to their absolute essence,
p74
aVand from that essence create a new language,
p75
aVa language that speaks very lovingly and unflinchingly
p76
aVabout who we really are.
p77
aVIt's a language that's still evolving.
p78
aa(lp79
VNow over the centuries it grew into the big pieces we always think of,
p80
aVlike concertos and symphonies,
p81
aVbut even the most ambitious masterpiece
p82
aVcan have as its central mission
p83
aVto bring you back to a fragile and personal moment \u2014
p84
aVlike this one from the Beethoven Violin Concerto.
p85
aV(Music)
p86
aVIt's so simple, so evocative.
p87
aVSo many emotions seem to be inside of it.
p88
aVYet, of course, like all music,
p89
aVit's essentially not about anything.
p90
aVIt's just a design of pitches and silence and time.
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd the pitches, the notes, as you know, are just vibrations.
p93
aVThey're locations in the spectrum of sound.
p94
aVAnd whether we call them 440 per second, A,
p95
aVor 3,729, B flat \u2014 trust me, that's right \u2014
p96
aVthey're just phenomena.
p97
aVBut the way we react to different combinations of these phenomena
p98
aVis complex and emotional and not totally understood.
p99
aVAnd the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries,
p100
aVas have our preferences for them.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo for example, in the 11th century,
p103
aVpeople liked pieces that ended like this.
p104
aV(Music)
p105
aVAnd in the 17th century, it was more like this.
p106
aV(Music)
p107
aVAnd in the 21st century ...
p108
aV(Music)
p109
aa(lp110
VNow your 21st century ears are quite happy with this last chord,
p111
aVeven though a while back it would have puzzled or annoyed you
p112
aVor sent some of you running from the room.
p113
aVAnd the reason you like it
p114
aVis because you've inherited, whether you knew it or not,
p115
aVcenturies-worth of changes
p116
aVin musical theory, practice and fashion.
p117
aa(lp118
VAnd in classical music we can follow these changes very, very accurately
p119
aVbecause of the music's powerful silent partner,
p120
aVthe way it's been passed on: notation.
p121
aVNow the impulse to notate,
p122
aVor, more exactly I should say, encode music
p123
aVhas been with us for a very long time.
p124
aVIn 200 B.C., a man named Sekulos
p125
aVwrote this song for his departed wife
p126
aVand inscribed it on her gravestone
p127
aVin the notational system of the Greeks.
p128
aV(Music)
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd a thousand years later,
p131
aVthis impulse to notate took an entirely different form.
p132
aVAnd you can see how this happened
p133
aVin these excerpts from the Christmas mass "Puer Natus est nobis,"
p134
aV"For Us is Born."
p135
aV(Music)
p136
aVIn the 10th century, little squiggles were used
p137
aVjust to indicate the general shape of the tune.
p138
aVAnd in the 12th century, a line was drawn, like a musical horizon line,
p139
aVto better pinpoint the pitch's location.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd then in the 13th century, more lines and new shapes of notes
p142
aVlocked in the concept of the tune exactly,
p143
aVand that led to the kind of notation we have today.
p144
aVWell notation not only passed the music on,
p145
aVnotating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely,
p146
aVbecause it enabled the musicians
p147
aVto imagine music on a much vaster scale.
p148
aa(lp149
VNow inspired moves of improvisation
p150
aVcould be recorded, saved, considered, prioritized,
p151
aVmade into intricate designs.
p152
aVAnd from this moment, classical music became
p153
aVwhat it most essentially is,
p154
aVa dialogue between the two powerful sides of our nature:
p155
aVinstinct and intelligence.
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd there began to be a real difference at this point
p158
aVbetween the art of improvisation
p159
aVand the art of composition.
p160
aVNow an improviser senses and plays the next cool move,
p161
aVbut a composer is considering all possible moves,
p162
aVtesting them out, prioritizing them out,
p163
aVuntil he sees how they can form a powerful and coherent design
p164
aVof ultimate and enduring coolness.
p165
aVNow some of the greatest composers, like Bach,
p166
aVwere combinations of these two things.
p167
aVBach was like a great improviser with a mind of a chess master.
p168
aVMozart was the same way.
p169
aa(lp170
VBut every musician strikes a different balance
p171
aVbetween faith and reason, instinct and intelligence.
p172
aVAnd every musical era had different priorities of these things,
p173
aVdifferent things to pass on, different 'whats' and 'hows'.
p174
aVSo in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition
p175
aVthe big 'what' was to praise God.
p176
aVAnd by the 1400s, music was being written
p177
aVthat tried to mirror God's mind
p178
aVas could be seen in the design of the night sky.
p179
aVThe 'how' was a style called polyphony,
p180
aVmusic of many independently moving voices
p181
aVthat suggested the way the planets seemed to move
p182
aVin Ptolemy's geocentric universe.
p183
aVThis was truly the music of the spheres.
p184
aV(Music)
p185
aa(lp186
VThis is the kind of music that Leonardo DaVinci would have known.
p187
aVAnd perhaps its tremendous intellectual perfection and serenity
p188
aVmeant that something new had to happen \u2014
p189
aVa radical new move, which in 1600 is what did happen.
p190
aV(Music) Singer: Ah, bitter blow!
p191
aVAh, wicked, cruel fate!
p192
aVAh, baleful stars!
p193
aVAh, avaricious heaven!
p194
aa(lp195
VMTT: This, of course, was the birth of opera,
p196
aVand its development put music on a radical new course.
p197
aVThe what now was not to mirror the mind of God,
p198
aVbut to follow the emotion turbulence of man.
p199
aVAnd the how was harmony,
p200
aVstacking up the pitches to form chords.
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd the chords, it turned out,
p203
aVwere capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions.
p204
aVAnd the basic chords were the ones we still have with us,
p205
aVthe triads,
p206
aVeither the major one,
p207
aVwhich we think is happy,
p208
aVor the minor one,
p209
aVwhich we perceive as sad.
p210
aVBut what's the actual difference between these two chords?
p211
aVIt's just these two notes in the middle.
p212
aVIt's either E natural,
p213
aVand 659 vibrations per second,
p214
aVor E flat, at 622.
p215
aVSo the big difference between human happiness and sadness?
p216
aV37 freakin' vibrations.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo you can see in a system like this
p219
aVthere was enormous subtle potential
p220
aVof representing human emotions.
p221
aVAnd in fact, as man began to understand more
p222
aVhis complex and ambivalent nature,
p223
aVharmony grew more complex to reflect it.
p224
aVTurns out it was capable of expressing emotions
p225
aVbeyond the ability of words.
p226
aa(lp227
VNow with all this possibility,
p228
aVclassical music really took off.
p229
aVIt's the time in which the big forms began to arise.
p230
aVAnd the effects of technology began to be felt also,
p231
aVbecause printing put music, the scores, the codebooks of music,
p232
aVinto the hands of performers everywhere.
p233
aVAnd new and improved instruments
p234
aVmade the age of the virtuoso possible.
p235
aVThis is when those big forms arose \u2014
p236
aVthe symphonies, the sonatas, the concertos.
p237
aa(lp238
VAnd in these big architectures of time,
p239
aVcomposers like Beethoven could share the insights of a lifetime.
p240
aVA piece like Beethoven's Fifth
p241
aVbasically witnessing how it was possible
p242
aVfor him to go from sorrow and anger,
p243
aVover the course of a half an hour,
p244
aVstep by exacting step of his route,
p245
aVto the moment when he could make it across to joy.
p246
aV(Music)
p247
aa(lp248
VAnd it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues,
p249
aVlike gripping ones of culture,
p250
aVsuch as nationalism or quest for freedom
p251
aVor the frontiers of sensuality.
p252
aVBut whatever direction the music took,
p253
aVone thing until recently was always the same,
p254
aVand that was when the musicians stopped playing,
p255
aVthe music stopped.
p256
aa(lp257
VNow this moment so fascinates me.
p258
aVI find it such a profound one.
p259
aVWhat happens when the music stops?
p260
aVWhere does it go? What's left?
p261
aVWhat sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance?
p262
aVIs it a melody or a rhythm
p263
aVor a mood or an attitude?
p264
aVAnd how might that change their lives?
p265
aa(lp266
VTo me this is the intimate, personal side of music.
p267
aVIt's the passing on part. It's the 'why' part of it.
p268
aVAnd to me that's the most essential of all.
p269
aVMostly it's been a person-to-person thing,
p270
aVa teacher-student, performer-audience thing,
p271
aVand then around 1880 came this new technology
p272
aVthat first mechanically then through analogs then digitally
p273
aVcreated a new and miraculous way of passing things on,
p274
aValbeit an impersonal one.
p275
aVPeople could now hear music all the time,
p276
aVeven though it wasn't necessary
p277
aVfor them to play an instrument, read music or even go to concerts.
p278
aa(lp279
VAnd technology democratized music by making everything available.
p280
aVIt spearheaded a cultural revolution
p281
aVin which artists like Caruso and Bessie Smith were on the same footing.
p282
aVAnd technology pushed composers to tremendous extremes,
p283
aVusing computers and synthesizers
p284
aVto create works of intellectually impenetrable complexity
p285
aVbeyond the means of performers and audiences.
p286
aa(lp287
VAt the same time technology,
p288
aVby taking over the role that notation had always played,
p289
aVshifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence
p290
aVway over to the instinctive side.
p291
aVThe culture in which we live now
p292
aVis awash with music of improvisation
p293
aVthat's been sliced, diced, layered
p294
aVand, God knows, distributed and sold.
p295
aVWhat's the long-term effect of this on us or on music?
p296
aVNobody knows.
p297
aa(lp298
VThe question remains: What happens when the music stops?
p299
aVWhat sticks with people?
p300
aVNow that we have unlimited access to music, what does stick with us?
p301
aa(lp302
VWell let me show you a story of what I mean
p303
aVby "really sticking with us."
p304
aVI was visiting a cousin of mine in an old age home,
p305
aVand I spied a very shaky old man
p306
aVmaking his way across the room on a walker.
p307
aVHe came over to a piano that was there,
p308
aVand he balanced himself and began playing something like this.
p309
aV(Music)
p310
aa(lp311
VAnd he said something like, "Me ... boy ... symphony ... Beethoven."
p312
aVAnd I suddenly got it,
p313
aVand I said, "Friend, by any chance are you trying to play this?"
p314
aV(Music)
p315
aVAnd he said, "Yes, yes. I was a little boy.
p316
aVThe symphony: Isaac Stern, the concerto, I heard it."
p317
aVAnd I thought, my God,
p318
aVhow much must this music mean to this man
p319
aVthat he would get himself out of his bed, across the room
p320
aVto recover the memory of this music
p321
aVthat, after everything else in his life is sloughing away,
p322
aVstill means so much to him?
p323
aa(lp324
VWell, that's why I take every performance so seriously,
p325
aVwhy it matters to me so much.
p326
aVI never know who might be there, who might be absorbing it
p327
aVand what will happen to it in their life.
p328
aa(lp329
VBut now I'm excited that there's more chance than ever before possible
p330
aVof sharing this music.
p331
aVThat's what drives my interest in projects
p332
aVlike the TV series "Keeping Score" with the San Francisco Symphony
p333
aVthat looks at the backstories of music,
p334
aVand working with the young musicians at the New World Symphony
p335
aVon projects that explore the potential
p336
aVof the new performing arts centers
p337
aVfor both entertainment and education.
p338
aa(lp339
VAnd of course, the New World Symphony
p340
aVled to the YouTube Symphony and projects on the internet
p341
aVthat reach out to musicians and audiences all over the world.
p342
aVAnd the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype.
p343
aVThere's just a role here for so many people \u2014
p344
aVteachers, parents, performers \u2014
p345
aVto be explorers together.
p346
aVSure, the big events attract a lot of attention,
p347
aVbut what really matters is what goes on every single day.
p348
aVWe need your perspectives, your curiosity, your voices.
p349
aa(lp350
VAnd it excites me now to meet people
p351
aVwho are hikers, chefs, code writers, taxi drivers,
p352
aVpeople I never would have guessed who loved the music
p353
aVand who are passing it on.
p354
aVYou don't need to worry about knowing anything.
p355
aVIf you're curious, if you have a capacity for wonder, if you're alive,
p356
aVyou know all that you need to know.
p357
aVYou can start anywhere. Ramble a bit.
p358
aVFollow traces. Get lost. Be surprised, amused inspired.
p359
aVAll that 'what', all that 'how' is out there
p360
aVwaiting for you to discover its 'why',
p361
aVto dive in and pass it on.
p362
aa(lp363
VThank you.

He&#39;s also the founder of the New World Symphony, an orchestra that helps to educate young and gifted musicians as obsessed with their craft as he. Since its establishment in 1987, New World Symphony has launched the careers of more than 700 young musicians, and in its new Miami Beach concert hall designed by Frank Gehry, it&#39;s bringing well-played classical music to a truly popular audience.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>He&#39;s the guest conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra -- and the artistic director of the YouTube Symphony Orchestra (YTSO), a 96-member ensemble selected from online video auditions. Tilson Thomas conducted the YTSO at Carnegie Hall in 2009 and in 2011 in Sydney, Australia. And he&#39;s the creator of the Keeping Score education program for public schools, which uses PBS TV, web, radio and DVDs, and a K-12 curriculum to make classical music more accessible. In 2010, Tilson Thomas was awarded the National Medal of Arts, the highest award given to artists by the US government.</div><div><br /></div>", "slug": "michael_tilson_thomas", "whotheyare":

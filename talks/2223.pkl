VWhen I wrote my memoir,
p5
aVthe publishers were really confused.
p6
aVWas it about me as a child refugee,
p7
aVor as a woman who set up a high-tech software company back in the 1960s,
p8
aVone that went public
p9
aVand eventually employed over 8,500 people?
p10
aVOr was it as a mother of an autistic child?
p11
aVOr as a philanthropist that's now given away serious money?
p12
aVWell, it turns out, I'm all of these.
p13
aVSo let me tell you my story.
p14
aa(lp15
VAll that I am stems from when I got onto a train in Vienna,
p16
aVpart of the Kindertransport that saved nearly 10,000 Jewish children
p17
aVfrom Nazi Europe.
p18
aVI was five years old, clutching the hand of my nine-year-old sister
p19
aVand had very little idea as to  what was going on.
p20
aV"What is England and  why am I going there?"
p21
aVI'm only alive because so long ago,  I was helped by generous strangers.
p22
aVI was lucky, and doubly lucky to be later reunited
p23
aVwith my birth parents.
p24
aVBut, sadly, I never bonded  with them again.
p25
aVBut I've done more in the seven decades since that miserable day
p26
aVwhen my mother put me on the train
p27
aVthan I would ever have dreamed possible.
p28
aVAnd I love England, my adopted country,
p29
aVwith a passion that perhaps only someone who has lost their human rights can feel.
p30
aVI decided to make mine a life that was worth saving.
p31
aVAnd then, I just got on with it.
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VLet me take you back to the early 1960s.
p35
aVTo get past the gender issues of the time,
p36
aVI set up my own software house at one of the first such startups in Britain.
p37
aVBut it was also a company of women, a company for women,
p38
aVan early social business.
p39
aVAnd people laughed at the very idea because software, at that time,
p40
aVwas given away free with hardware.
p41
aVNobody would buy software, certainly not from a woman.
p42
aVAlthough women were then coming out of the universities with decent degrees,
p43
aVthere was a glass ceiling to our progress.
p44
aVAnd I'd hit that glass ceiling too often,
p45
aVand I wanted opportunities for women.
p46
aa(lp47
VI recruited professionally qualified women who'd left the industry on marriage,
p48
aVor when their first child was expected
p49
aVand structured them into a home-working organization.
p50
aVWe pioneered the concept of women going back into the workforce
p51
aVafter a career break.
p52
aVWe pioneered all sorts of new, flexible work methods:
p53
aVjob shares, profit-sharing,  and eventually, co-ownership
p54
aVwhen I took a quarter of the company into the hands of the staff
p55
aVat no cost to anyone but me.
p56
aVFor years, I was the first woman this, or the only woman that.
p57
aVAnd in those days, I couldn't work on the stock exchange,
p58
aVI couldn't drive a bus or fly an airplane.
p59
aVIndeed, I couldn't open a bank account without my husband's permission.
p60
aVMy generation of women fought the battles for the right to work
p61
aVand the right for equal pay.
p62
aa(lp63
VNobody really expected much  from people at work or in society
p64
aVbecause all the expectations then
p65
aVwere about home and  family responsibilities.
p66
aVAnd I couldn't really face that,
p67
aVso I started to challenge the conventions of the time,
p68
aVeven to the extent of changing my name from "Stephanie" to "Steve"
p69
aVin my business development letters,
p70
aVso as to get through the door before anyone realized
p71
aVthat he was a she.
p72
aV(Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
VMy company, called Freelance Programmers, and that's precisely what it was,
p75
aVcouldn't have started smaller:  on the dining room table,
p76
aVand financed by the equivalent of 100 dollars in today's terms,
p77
aVand financed by my labor and  by borrowing against the house.
p78
aVMy interests were scientific,  the market was commercial \u2014
p79
aVthings such as payroll, which I found rather boring.
p80
aVSo I had to compromise with  operational research work,
p81
aVwhich had the intellectual challenge  that interested me
p82
aVand the commercial value  that was valued by the clients:
p83
aVthings like scheduling freight trains,
p84
aVtime-tabling buses, stock control, lots and lots of stock control.
p85
aVAnd eventually, the work came in.
p86
aVWe disguised the domestic and part-time nature of the staff
p87
aVby offering fixed prices, one of the very first to do so.
p88
aVAnd who would have guessed that the programming
p89
aVof the black box flight recorder  of Supersonic Concord
p90
aVwould have been done by a bunch  of women working in their own homes.
p91
aV(Applause)
p92
aa(lp93
VAll we used was a simple  "trust the staff" approach
p94
aVand a simple telephone.
p95
aVWe even used to ask job applicants,  "Do you have access to a telephone?"
p96
aa(lp97
VAn early project was to develop software standards
p98
aVon management control protocols.
p99
aVAnd software was and still is a maddeningly hard-to-control activity,
p100
aVso that was enormously valuable.
p101
aVWe used the standards ourselves,
p102
aVwe were even paid to update  them over the years,
p103
aVand eventually, they were adopted by NATO.
p104
aVOur programmers \u2014 remember, only women,
p105
aVincluding gay and transgender \u2014
p106
aVworked with pencil and paper to develop flowcharts
p107
aVdefining each task to be done.
p108
aVAnd they then wrote code,  usually machine code,
p109
aVsometimes binary code,
p110
aVwhich was then sent by mail to a data center
p111
aVto be punched onto paper tape or card
p112
aVand then re-punched,  in order to verify it.
p113
aVAll this, before it ever got near a computer.
p114
aVThat was programming in the early 1960s.
p115
aa(lp116
VIn 1975, 13 years from startup,
p117
aVequal opportunity legislation  came in in Britain
p118
aVand that made it illegal to have  our pro-female policies.
p119
aVAnd as an example of  unintended consequences,
p120
aVmy female company had to let the men in.
p121
aV(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VWhen I started my company of women,
p124
aVthe men said, "How interesting, because it only works because it's small."
p125
aVAnd later, as it became sizable,  they accepted, "Yes, it is sizable now,
p126
aVbut of no strategic interest."
p127
aVAnd later, when it was a company valued at over three billion dollars,
p128
aVand I'd made 70 of the staff  into millionaires,
p129
aVthey sort of said, "Well done, Steve!"
p130
aV(Laughter)
p131
aV(Applause)
p132
aa(lp133
VYou can always tell ambitious women by the shape of our heads:
p134
aVThey're flat on top for being  patted patronizingly.
p135
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p136
aVAnd we have larger feet to stand away from the kitchen sink.
p137
aV(Laughter)
p138
aa(lp139
VLet me share with you  two secrets of success:
p140
aVSurround yourself with first-class people and people that you like;
p141
aVand choose your partner very, very carefully.
p142
aVBecause the other day when I said,  "My husband's an angel,"
p143
aVa woman complained \u2014 "You're lucky," she said,
p144
aV"mine's still alive."
p145
aV(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VIf success were easy,  we'd all be millionaires.
p148
aVBut in my case, it came in the midst of family trauma and indeed, crisis.
p149
aVOur late son, Giles, was an only child, a beautiful, contented baby.
p150
aVAnd then, at two and a half,
p151
aVlike a changeling in a fairy story,
p152
aVhe lost the little speech that he had
p153
aVand turned into a wild,  unmanageable toddler.
p154
aVNot the terrible twos;
p155
aVhe was profoundly autistic  and he never spoke again.
p156
aVGiles was the first resident in the first house of the first charity that I set up
p157
aVto pioneer services for autism.
p158
aVAnd then there's been a groundbreaking Prior's Court school
p159
aVfor pupils with autism
p160
aVand a medical research charity, again, all for autism.
p161
aVBecause whenever I found a gap in services, I tried to help.
p162
aVI like doing new things  and making new things happen.
p163
aVAnd I've just started a three-year  think tank for autism.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd so that some of my wealth does go back to the industry from which it stems,
p166
aVI've also founded  the Oxford Internet Institute
p167
aVand other IT ventures.
p168
aVThe Oxford Internet Institute focuses not on the technology,
p169
aVbut on the social, economic, legal and ethical issues of the Internet.
p170
aa(lp171
VGiles died unexpectedly 17 years ago now.
p172
aVAnd I have learned to live without him,
p173
aVand I have learned to live  without his need of me.
p174
aVPhilanthropy is all that I do now.
p175
aVI need never worry about getting lost
p176
aVbecause several charities would quickly come and find me.
p177
aV(Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
VIt's one thing to have an idea  for an enterprise,
p180
aVbut as many people in this room will know,
p181
aVmaking it happen is a very difficult thing
p182
aVand it demands extraordinary energy, self-belief and determination,
p183
aVthe courage to risk family and home,
p184
aVand a 24/7 commitment  that borders on the obsessive.
p185
aVSo it's just as well that I'm a workaholic.
p186
aVI believe in the beauty of work when we do it properly and in humility.
p187
aVWork is not just something I do when I'd rather be doing something else.
p188
aa(lp189
VWe live our lives forward.
p190
aVSo what has all that taught me?
p191
aVI learned that tomorrow's  never going to be like today,
p192
aVand certainly nothing like yesterday.
p193
aVAnd that made me able to cope with change,
p194
aVindeed, eventually to welcome change,
p195
aVthough I'm told I'm still very difficult.
p196
aa(lp197
VThank you very much.

austerity of post-World War II England, jobs were few, and opportunities for women to earn a wage were even fewer. So, on her dining room table, Stephanie Shirley founded the kind of company she&#39;d like to work for -- one that posed challenging, rewarding tasks, built around flexible work rules that made it possible to have a real life. Her software company, Freelance Programmers made her one of the richest women in England (and one of the few to have earned her own money). Initially employing only women -- Shirley often bid for contracts as &quot;Steve&quot; to compete in the male-dominated industry -- the company was eventually valued at $3 billion, while 70 of the staff became millionaires when it floated on the stock market.</p><p>But money wasn&#39;t Shirley&#39;s object. &quot;A lot of people go into business to make money,&quot; she told the <em>Guardian</em>. &quot;I really didn&#39;t; I went in with a mission for women. Conversely, I was determined never, ever to be poor again.&quot; Freelance Programmers became the FI Group became Xansa; it was acquired by Steria in 2007.  </p><p>Shirley retired in 1993, but she hasn&#39;t stopped pushing for progress in the fields she loves. For instance, she works tirelessly to push forward research into autism spectrum disorders, as well as to study and improve the IT industry and the role of the internet in society.

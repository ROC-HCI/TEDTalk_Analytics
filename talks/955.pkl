VIf nothing else, at least I've discovered
p5
aVwhat it is we put our speakers through:
p6
aVsweaty palms, sleepless nights,
p7
aVa wholly unnatural fear of clocks.
p8
aVI mean, it's quite brutal.
p9
aa(lp10
VAnd I'm also a little nervous about this.
p11
aVThere are nine billion humans coming our way.
p12
aVNow, the most optimistic dreams
p13
aVcan get dented by the prospect
p14
aVof people plundering the planet.
p15
aVBut recently, I've become intrigued
p16
aVby a different way of thinking of large human crowds,
p17
aVbecause there are circumstances
p18
aVwhere they can do something really cool.
p19
aVIt's a phenomenon that I think
p20
aVany organization or individual can tap into.
p21
aVIt certainly impacted the way we think about TED's future,
p22
aVand perhaps the world's future overall.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo, let's explore.
p25
aVThe story starts with just a single person,
p26
aVa child, behaving a little strangely.
p27
aVThis kid is known online as Lil Demon.
p28
aVHe's doing tricks here, dance tricks,
p29
aVthat probably no six-year-old in history ever managed before.
p30
aVHow did he learn them?
p31
aVAnd what drove him to spend the hundreds of hours of practice
p32
aVthis must have taken?
p33
aVHere's a clue.
p34
aa(lp35
V(Video) Lil Demon: \u266b Step your game up. Oh. Oh. \u266b
p36
aV\u266b Step your game up. Oh. Oh. \u266b
p37
aa(lp38
VChris Anderson: So, that was sent to me by this man,
p39
aVa filmmaker, Jonathan Chu,
p40
aVwho told me that was the moment he realized
p41
aVthe Internet was causing dance to evolve.
p42
aVThis is what he said at TED in February.
p43
aVIn essence,
p44
aVdancers were challenging each other online to get better;
p45
aVincredible new dance skills were being invented;
p46
aVeven the six-year-olds were joining in.
p47
aVIt felt like a revolution.
p48
aVAnd so Jon had a brilliant idea:
p49
aVHe went out to recruit the best of the best dancers
p50
aVoff of YouTube
p51
aVto create this dance troupe \u2014
p52
aVThe League of Extraordinary Dancers, the LXD.
p53
aVI mean, these kids were web-taught,
p54
aVbut they were so good that they got to play at the Oscars this year.
p55
aVAnd at TED here in February,
p56
aVtheir passion and brilliance just took our breath away.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo, this story
p59
aVof the evolution of dance
p60
aVseems strangely familiar.
p61
aVYou know, a while after TEDTalks started taking off,
p62
aVwe noticed that speakers
p63
aVwere starting to spend a lot more time in preparation.
p64
aVIt was resulting in incredible new talks like these two.
p65
aV... Months of preparation
p66
aVcrammed into 18 minutes,
p67
aVraising the bar cruelly for the next generation of speakers,
p68
aVwith the effects that we've seen this week.
p69
aVIt's not as if J.J. and Jill
p70
aVactually ended their talks saying, "Step your game up,"
p71
aVbut they might as well have.
p72
aVSo, in both of these cases,
p73
aVyou've got these cycles of improvement,
p74
aVapparently driven
p75
aVby people watching web video.
p76
aa(lp77
VWhat is going on here?
p78
aVWell, I think it's the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call
p79
aV"crowd-accelerated innovation."
p80
aVAnd there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear.
p81
aVYou can think of them
p82
aVas three dials on a giant wheel.
p83
aVYou turn up the dials, the wheel starts to turn.
p84
aVAnd the first thing you need is ... a crowd,
p85
aVa group of people who share a common interest.
p86
aVThe bigger the crowd,
p87
aVthe more potential innovators there are.
p88
aVThat's important, but actually most people in the crowd
p89
aVoccupy these other roles.
p90
aVThey're creating the ecosystem
p91
aVfrom which innovation emerges.
p92
aVThe second thing you need is light.
p93
aVYou need clear, open visibility
p94
aVof what the best people in that crowd are capable of,
p95
aVbecause that is how you will learn
p96
aVhow you will be empowered to participate.
p97
aVAnd third, you need desire.
p98
aVYou know, innovation's hard work.
p99
aVIt's based on hundreds of hours of research, of practice.
p100
aVAbsent desire, not going to happen.
p101
aa(lp102
VNow, here's an example \u2014 pre-Internet \u2014
p103
aVof this machine in action.
p104
aVDancers at a street corner \u2014
p105
aVit's a crowd, a small one,
p106
aVbut they can all obviously see what each other can do.
p107
aVAnd the desire part comes, I guess,
p108
aVfrom social status, right?
p109
aVBest dancer walks tall, gets the best date.
p110
aVThere's probably going to be some innovation happening here.
p111
aVBut on the web,
p112
aVall three dials are ratcheted right up.
p113
aVThe dance community is now global.
p114
aVThere's millions connected.
p115
aVAnd amazingly,
p116
aVyou can still see what the best can do,
p117
aVbecause the crowd itself shines a light on them,
p118
aVeither directly, through comments, ratings,
p119
aVemail, Facebook, Twitter,
p120
aVor indirectly,
p121
aVthrough numbers of views,
p122
aVthrough links that point Google there.
p123
aVSo, it's easy to find the good stuff,
p124
aVand when you've found it, you can watch it in close-up repeatedly
p125
aVand read what hundreds of people have written about it.
p126
aVThat's a lot of light.
p127
aa(lp128
VBut the desire element
p129
aVis really dialed way up.
p130
aVI mean, you might just be a kid with a webcam,
p131
aVbut if you can do something that goes viral,
p132
aVyou get to be seen by the equivalent
p133
aVof sports stadiums crammed with people.
p134
aVYou get hundreds of strangers writing excitedly about you.
p135
aVAnd even if it's not that eloquent \u2014 and it's not \u2014
p136
aVit can still really make your day.
p137
aVSo, this possibility
p138
aVof a new type of global recognition,
p139
aVI think, is driving huge amounts of effort.
p140
aVAnd it's important to note that it's not just the stars who are benefiting:
p141
aVbecause you can see the best, everyone can learn.
p142
aa(lp143
VAlso, the system is self-fueling.
p144
aVIt's the crowd that shines the light and fuels the desire,
p145
aVbut the light and desire are a lethal one-two combination
p146
aVthat attract new people to the crowd.
p147
aVSo, this is a model
p148
aVthat pretty much any organization could use
p149
aVto try and nurture its own cycle
p150
aVof crowd-accelerated innovation.
p151
aVInvite the crowd, let in the light,
p152
aVdial up the desire.
p153
aVAnd the hardest part about that is probably the light,
p154
aVbecause it means you have to open up,
p155
aVyou have to show your stuff to the world.
p156
aVIt's by giving away what you think is your deepest secret
p157
aVthat maybe millions of people
p158
aVare empowered to help improve it.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd, very happily, there's one class of people
p161
aVwho really can't make use of this tool.
p162
aVThe dark side of the web
p163
aVis allergic to the light.
p164
aVI don't think we're going to see terrorists, for example,
p165
aVpublishing their plans online and saying to the world,
p166
aV"Please, could you help us to actually
p167
aVmake them work this time?"
p168
aa(lp169
VBut you can publish your stuff online.
p170
aVAnd if you can get that wheel to turn,
p171
aVlook out.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo, at TED,
p174
aVwe've become a little obsessed with this idea of openness.
p175
aVIn fact, my colleague, June Cohen, has taken to calling it "radical openness,"
p176
aVbecause it works for us each time.
p177
aVWe opened up our talks to the world,
p178
aVand suddenly there are millions of people out there
p179
aVhelping spread our speakers' ideas,
p180
aVand thereby making it easier for us
p181
aVto recruit and motivate the next generation of speakers.
p182
aVBy opening up our translation program,
p183
aVthousands of heroic volunteers \u2014
p184
aVsome of them watching online right now, and thank you! \u2014
p185
aVhave translated our talks
p186
aVinto more than 70 languages,
p187
aVthereby tripling our viewership in non-English-speaking countries.
p188
aVBy giving away our TEDx brand,
p189
aVwe suddenly have a thousand-plus
p190
aVlive experiments in the art of spreading ideas.
p191
aVAnd these organizers,
p192
aVthey're seeing each other, they're learning from each other.
p193
aVWe are learning from them.
p194
aVWe're getting great talks back from them.
p195
aVThe wheel is turning.
p196
aa(lp197
VOkay, step back a minute.
p198
aVI mean, it's really not news for me to tell you
p199
aVthat innovation emerges out of groups.
p200
aVYou know, we've heard that this week \u2014
p201
aVthis romantic notion of the lone genius
p202
aVwith the "eureka!" moment that changes the world
p203
aVis misleading.
p204
aVEven he said that, and he would know.
p205
aVWe're a social species.
p206
aVWe spark off each other.
p207
aVIt's also not news
p208
aVto say that the Internet has accelerated innovation.
p209
aVFor the past 15 years,
p210
aVpowerful communities have been connecting online,
p211
aVsparking off each other.
p212
aVIf you take programmers,
p213
aVyou know, the whole open-source movement
p214
aVis a fantastic instance of crowd-accelerated innovation.
p215
aVBut what's key here is,
p216
aVthe reason these groups have been able to connect
p217
aVis because their work output is of the type
p218
aVthat can be easily shared digitally \u2014
p219
aVa picture, a music file,
p220
aVsoftware.
p221
aVAnd that's why what I'm excited about,
p222
aVand what I think is under-reported,
p223
aVis the significance of the rise
p224
aVof online video.
p225
aa(lp226
VThis is the technology
p227
aVthat's going to allow the rest of the world's talents to be shared digitally,
p228
aVthereby launching a whole new cycle
p229
aVof crowd-accelerated innovation.
p230
aVThe first few years of the web
p231
aVwere pretty much video-free,
p232
aVfor this reason: video files are huge; the web couldn't handle them.
p233
aVBut in the last 10 years,
p234
aVbandwidth has exploded a hundredfold.
p235
aVSuddenly, here we are.
p236
aVHumanity watches 80 million hours of YouTube every day.
p237
aVCisco actually estimates that, within four years,
p238
aVmore than 90 percent of the web's data will be video.
p239
aVIf it's all puppies, porn and piracy,
p240
aVwe're doomed.
p241
aVI don't think it will be.
p242
aVVideo is high-bandwidth for a reason.
p243
aVIt packs a huge amount of data,
p244
aVand our brains are uniquely wired to decode it.
p245
aa(lp246
VHere, let me introduce you to Sam Haber.
p247
aVHe's a unicyclist.
p248
aVBefore YouTube,
p249
aVthere was no way for him to discover
p250
aVhis sport's true potential,
p251
aVbecause you can't communicate this stuff in words, right?
p252
aVBut looking at video clips posted by strangers,
p253
aVa world of possibility opens up for him.
p254
aVSuddenly, he starts to emulate and then to innovate.
p255
aVAnd a global community of unicyclists discover each other online,
p256
aVinspire each other to greatness.
p257
aVAnd there are thousands of other examples of this happening \u2014
p258
aVof video-driven evolution of skills,
p259
aVranging from the physical to the artful.
p260
aVAnd I have to tell you,
p261
aVas a former publisher of hobbyist magazines,
p262
aVI find this strangely beautiful.
p263
aVI mean, there's a lot of passion right here on this screen.
p264
aa(lp265
VBut if Rube Goldberg machines
p266
aVand video poetry aren't quite your cup of tea,
p267
aVhow about this.
p268
aVJove is a website
p269
aVthat was founded to encourage scientists
p270
aVto publish their peer-reviewed research
p271
aVon video.
p272
aVThere's a problem with a traditional scientific paper.
p273
aVIt can take months for a scientist in another lab
p274
aVto figure out how to replicate the experiments
p275
aVthat are described in print.
p276
aVHere's one such frustrated scientist,
p277
aVMoshe Pritsker, the founder of Jove.
p278
aVHe told me that the world is wasting
p279
aVbillions of dollars on this.
p280
aVBut look at this video.
p281
aVI mean, look: if you can show
p282
aVinstead of just describing,
p283
aVthat problem goes away.
p284
aVSo it's not far-fetched to say
p285
aVthat, at some point,
p286
aVonline video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance.
p287
aa(lp288
VHere's another example
p289
aVthat's close to our hearts at TED,
p290
aVwhere video is sometimes more powerful than print \u2014
p291
aVthe sharing of an idea.
p292
aVWhy do people like watching TEDTalks?
p293
aVAll those ideas are already out there in print.
p294
aVIt's actually faster to read than to view.
p295
aVWhy would someone bother?
p296
aVWell, so, there's some showing as well as telling.
p297
aVBut even leaving the screen out of it,
p298
aVthere's still a lot more being transferred than just words.
p299
aVAnd in that non-verbal portion, there's some serious magic.
p300
aVSomewhere hidden in the physical gestures,
p301
aVthe vocal cadence, the facial expressions,
p302
aVthe eye contact,
p303
aVthe passion,
p304
aVthe kind of awkward, British body language,
p305
aVthe sense of how the audience are reacting,
p306
aVthere are hundreds of subconscious clues
p307
aVthat go to how well you will understand,
p308
aVand whether you're inspired \u2014
p309
aVlight, if you like,
p310
aVand desire.
p311
aVIncredibly, all of this can be communicated
p312
aVon just a few square inches of a screen.
p313
aa(lp314
VReading and writing are actually
p315
aVrelatively recent inventions.
p316
aVFace-to-face communication has been fine-tuned
p317
aVby millions of years of evolution.
p318
aVThat's what's made it into this mysterious, powerful thing it is.
p319
aVSomeone speaks,
p320
aVthere's resonance in all these receiving brains,
p321
aVthe whole group acts together.
p322
aVI mean, this is the connective tissue
p323
aVof the human superorganism in action.
p324
aVIt's probably driven our culture for millennia.
p325
aV500 years ago, it ran into
p326
aVa competitor with a lethal advantage.
p327
aVIt's right here.
p328
aVPrint scaled.
p329
aVThe world's ambitious innovators and influencers
p330
aVnow could get their ideas to spread far and wide,
p331
aVand so the art of the spoken word
p332
aVpretty much withered on the vine.
p333
aVBut now, in the blink of an eye,
p334
aVthe game has changed again.
p335
aVIt's not too much to say
p336
aVthat what Gutenberg did for writing,
p337
aVonline video can now do for face-to-face communication.
p338
aVSo, that primal medium,
p339
aVwhich your brain is exquisitely wired for ...
p340
aVthat just went global.
p341
aa(lp342
VNow, this is big.
p343
aVWe may have to reinvent an ancient art form.
p344
aVI mean, today, one person speaking
p345
aVcan be seen by millions,
p346
aVshedding bright light on potent ideas,
p347
aVcreating intense desire
p348
aVfor learning and to respond \u2014
p349
aVand in his case, intense desire to laugh.
p350
aVFor the first time in human history,
p351
aVtalented students
p352
aVdon't have to have their potential and their dreams
p353
aVwritten out of history by lousy teachers.
p354
aVThey can sit two feet in front of the world's finest.
p355
aa(lp356
VNow, TED is just a small part of this.
p357
aVI mean, the world's universities are opening up their curricula.
p358
aVThousands of individuals and organizations
p359
aVare sharing their knowledge and data online.
p360
aVThousands of people are figuring out new ways
p361
aVto learn and, crucially,
p362
aVto respond, completing the cycle.
p363
aVAnd so, as we've thought about this,
p364
aVyou know, it's become clear to us
p365
aVwhat the next stage of TED's evolution has to be.
p366
aVTEDTalks can't be a one-way process, one-to-many.
p367
aVOur future is many-to-many.
p368
aVSo, we're dreaming of ways
p369
aVto make it easier for you, the global TED community,
p370
aVto respond to speakers,
p371
aVto contribute your own ideas,
p372
aVmaybe even your own TEDTalks,
p373
aVand to help shine a light on the very best of what's out there.
p374
aVBecause, if we can bubble up the very best
p375
aVfrom a vastly larger pool,
p376
aVthis wheel turns.
p377
aa(lp378
VNow, is it possible to imagine
p379
aVa similar process to this,
p380
aVhappening to global education overall?
p381
aVI mean, does it have to be this painful,
p382
aVtop-down process?
p383
aVWhy not a self-fueling cycle
p384
aVin which we all can participate?
p385
aVIt's the participation age, right?
p386
aVSchools can't be silos.
p387
aVWe can't stop learning at age 21.
p388
aVWhat if, in the coming crowd of nine billion ...
p389
aVwhat if that crowd could learn enough
p390
aVto be net contributors,
p391
aVinstead of net plunderers?
p392
aVThat changes everything, right?
p393
aVI mean, that would take more teachers than we've ever had.
p394
aVBut the good news is they are out there.
p395
aVThey're in the crowd,
p396
aVand the crowd is switching on lights,
p397
aVand we can see them for the first time,
p398
aVnot as an undifferentiated mass of strangers,
p399
aVbut as individuals we can learn from.
p400
aVWho's the teacher?
p401
aVYou're the teacher.
p402
aVYou're part of the crowd
p403
aVthat may be about to launch
p404
aVthe biggest learning cycle in human history,
p405
aVa cycle capable of carrying all of us
p406
aVto a smarter, wiser, more beautiful place.
p407
aa(lp408
VHere's a group of kids in a village in Pakistan
p409
aVnear where I grew up.
p410
aVWithin five years, each of these kids is going to have access
p411
aVto a cellphone capable of full-on web video
p412
aVand capable of uploading video to the web.
p413
aVI mean, is it crazy to think that this girl,
p414
aVin the back, at the right, in 15 years,
p415
aVmight be sharing the idea that keeps the world beautiful
p416
aVfor your grandchildren?
p417
aVIt's not crazy; it's actually happening right now.
p418
aa(lp419
VI want to introduce you to a good friend of TED
p420
aVwho just happens to live in Africa's biggest shantytown.
p421
aa(lp422
V(Video) Christopher Makau: Hi. My name is Christopher Makau.
p423
aVI'm one of the organizers of TEDxKibera.
p424
aVThere are so many good things which are happening right here in Kibera.
p425
aVThere's a self-help group.
p426
aVThey turned a trash place into a garden.
p427
aVThe same spot, it was a crime spot
p428
aVwhere people were being robbed.
p429
aVThey used the same trash
p430
aVto form green manure.
p431
aVThe same trash site
p432
aVis feeding more than 30 families.
p433
aVWe have our own film school.
p434
aVThey are using Flip cameras
p435
aVto record, edit,
p436
aVand reporting to their own channel,
p437
aVKibera TV.
p438
aVBecause of a scarcity of land,
p439
aVwe are using the sacks to grow vegetables,
p440
aVand also [we're] able to save on the cost of living.
p441
aVChange happens when we see things in a different way.
p442
aVToday, I see Kibera in a different way.
p443
aVMy message to TEDGlobal
p444
aVand the entire world is:
p445
aVKibera is a hotbed
p446
aVof innovation and ideas.
p447

p452
aVWhat's new \u2014 and it's huge \u2014
p453
aVis that, for the first time, we get to see him,
p454
aVand he can see us.
p455
aVRight now, Chris and Kevin
p456
aVand Dennis and Dickson and their friends
p457

VIn Africa we say,
p5
aV"God gave the white man a watch
p6
aVand gave the black man time."
p7
aV(Laughter)
p8
aVI think, how is it possible
p9
aVfor a man with so much time
p10
aVto tell his story in 18 minutes?
p11
aVI think it will be quite a challenge for me.
p12
aa(lp13
VMost African stories these days,
p14
aVthey talk about famine,
p15
aVHIV and AIDS,
p16
aVpoverty or war.
p17
aVBut my story that I would like to share with you today
p18
aVis the one about success.
p19
aVIt is about a country
p20
aVin the southwest of Africa
p21
aVcalled Namibia.
p22
aVNamibia has got 2.1 million people,
p23
aVbut it is only twice the size of California.
p24
aa(lp25
VI come from a region
p26
aVin the remote northwest part of the country.
p27
aVIt's called Kunene region.
p28
aVAnd in the center of Kunene region
p29
aVis the village of Sesfontein. This is where I was born.
p30
aVThis is where I'm coming from.
p31
aVMost people that are following the story
p32
aVof Angelina Jolie
p33
aVand Brad Pitt
p34
aVwill know where Namibia is.
p35
aVThey love Namibia
p36
aVfor its beautiful dunes,
p37
aVthat are even taller
p38
aVthan the Empire State Building.
p39
aVWind and time have twisted our landscape
p40
aVinto very strange shapes,
p41
aVand these shapes are speckled with wildlife
p42
aVthat has become so adapted
p43
aVto this harsh and strange land.
p44
aa(lp45
VI'm a Himba.
p46
aVYou might wonder, why are you wearing these Western clothes?
p47
aVI'm a Himba and Namibian.
p48
aVA Himba is one of the 29
p49
aVethnic groups in Namibia.
p50
aVWe live a very traditional lifestyle.
p51
aVI grew up herding,
p52
aVlooking after our livestock \u2014
p53
aVgoats, sheep and cattle.
p54
aVAnd one day,
p55
aVmy father actually took me into the bush.
p56
aVHe said, "John,
p57
aVI want you to become a good herder.
p58
aVBoy, if you are looking after our livestock
p59
aVand you see a cheetah
p60
aVeating our goat \u2014
p61
aVcheetah is very nervous \u2014
p62
aVjust walk up to it.
p63
aVWalk up to it and smack it on the backside."
p64
aV(Laughter)
p65
aV"And he will let go of the goat
p66
aVand run off."
p67
aVBut then he said,
p68
aV"Boy, if you run into a lion,
p69
aVdon't move.
p70
aVDon't move. Stand your ground.
p71
aVPuff up and just look it in the eye
p72
aVand it may not want to fight you."
p73
aV(Laughter)
p74
aVBut then, he said,
p75
aV"If you see a leopard,
p76
aVboy, you better run like hell."
p77
aV(Laughter)
p78
aV"Imagine you run faster than those goats you are looking after."
p79
aVIn this way \u2014
p80
aV(Laughter)
p81
aVIn this way, I actually started to learn about nature.
p82
aa(lp83
VIn addition to being an ordinary Namibian
p84
aVand in addition to being a Himba
p85
aVI'm also a trained conservationist.
p86
aVAnd it is very important if you are in the field
p87
aVto know what to confront
p88
aVand what to run from.
p89
aVI was born in 1971.
p90
aVWe lived under apartheid regime.
p91
aVThe whites could farm, graze
p92
aVand hunt as they wished,
p93
aVbut we black, we were not regarded as responsible
p94
aVto use wildlife.
p95
aVWhenever we tried to hunt,
p96
aVwe were called poachers.
p97
aVAnd as a result, we were fined and locked up in jail.
p98
aa(lp99
VBetween 1966 and 1990,
p100
aVthe U.S. and Soviet interests
p101
aVfought for control over my country.
p102
aVAnd you know, during war time,
p103
aVthere are militaries, armies, that are moving around.
p104
aVAnd the army hunted for valuable rhino horns
p105
aVand tusks.
p106
aVThey could sell these things for anything between
p107
aV$5,000 a kilo.
p108
aVDuring the same year
p109
aValmost every Himba had a rifle.
p110
aVBecause it was wartime,
p111
aVthe British .303 rifle
p112
aVwas just all over the whole country.
p113
aa(lp114
VThen in the same time, around 1980,
p115
aVwe had a very big drought.
p116
aVIt killed almost everything that was left.
p117
aVOur livestock was
p118
aValmost at the brink of extinction,
p119
aVprotected as well.
p120
aVWe were hungry.
p121
aVI remember a night
p122
aVwhen a hungry leopard
p123
aVwent into the house
p124
aVof one of our neighbors
p125
aVand took a sleeping child out of the bed.
p126
aVIt's a very sad story.
p127
aVBut even today,
p128
aVthat memory is still in people's minds.
p129
aVThey can pinpoint the exact location
p130
aVwhere this all happened.
p131
aVAnd then, in the same year,
p132
aVwe almost lost everything.
p133
aVAnd my father said, "Why don't you just go to school?"
p134
aVAnd they sent me off to school, just to get busy somewhere there.
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd the year I went to school,
p137
aVmy father actually got a job with a non-governmental organization
p138
aVcalled IRDNC, Integrated Rural Development and Nature Conservation.
p139
aVThey actually spend a lot of time a year in the communities.
p140
aVThey were trusted by the local communities
p141
aVlike our leader, Joshua Kangombe.
p142
aVJoshua Kangombe saw what was happening:
p143
aVwildlife disappearing,
p144
aVpoaching was skyrocketing,
p145
aVand the situation seemed very hopeless.
p146
aVDeath and despair surrounded Joshua
p147
aVand our entire communities.
p148
aa(lp149
VBut then, the people from IRDNC proposed to Joshua:
p150
aVWhat if we pay people that you trust
p151
aVto look after wildlife?
p152
aVDo you have anybody in your communities, or people,
p153
aVthat know the bush very well
p154
aVand that know wildlife very well?
p155
aVThe headman said: "Yes. Our poachers."
p156
aV"Eh? The poachers?"
p157
aV"Yes. Our poachers."
p158
aVAnd that was my father.
p159
aVMy father has been a poacher for quite a long time.
p160
aVInstead of shooting poachers dead
p161
aVlike they were doing elsewhere in Africa,
p162
aVIRDNC has helped men reclaim their abilities
p163
aVto manage their peoples
p164
aVand their rights to own and manage wildlife.
p165
aVAnd thus, as people started feeling ownership over wildlife,
p166
aVwildlife numbers started coming back,
p167
aVand that's actually becoming a foundation for conservation in Namibia.
p168
aVWith independence, the whole approach of community getting involved
p169
aVwas embraced by our new government.
p170
aa(lp171
VThree things that actually help to build on this foundation:
p172
aVThe very first one is
p173
aVhonoring of tradition and being open to new ideas.
p174
aVHere is our tradition:
p175
aVAt every Himba village, there is a sacred fire.
p176
aVAnd at this sacred fire, the spirit of our ancestors
p177
aVspeak through the headman
p178
aVand advise us where to get water,
p179
aVwhere to get grazings,
p180
aVand where to go and hunt.
p181
aVAnd I think this is the best way of regulating ourselves
p182
aVon the environment.
p183
aVAnd here are the new ideas.
p184
aVTransporting rhinos using helicopters
p185
aVI think is much easier
p186
aVthan talking through a spirit that you can't see, isn't it?
p187
aVAnd these things we were taught by outsiders.
p188
aVWe learned these things from outsiders.
p189
aVWe needed new boundaries to describe our traditional lands;
p190
aVwe needed to learn more things like GPS
p191
aVjust to see whether \u2014
p192
aVcan GPS really reflect the true reflection of the land
p193
aVor is this just a thing made somewhere in the West?
p194
aVAnd we then wanted to see whether we can match our
p195
aVancestral maps with digital maps made somewhere in the world.
p196
aVAnd through this,
p197
aVwe actually started realizing our dreams,
p198
aVand we maintained honoring our traditions
p199
aVbut we were still open to new ideas.
p200
aa(lp201
VThe second element is that we wanted to have a life,
p202
aVa better life where we can benefit through many things.
p203
aVMost poachers, like my father,
p204
aVwere people from our own community.
p205
aVThey were not people from outside.
p206
aVThese were our own people.
p207
aVAnd sometimes, once they were caught,
p208
aVthey were treated with respect, brought back into the communities
p209
aVand they were made part of the bigger dreams.
p210
aVThe best one, like my father \u2014 I'm not campaigning for my father \u2014
p211
aV(Laughter)
p212
aVthey were put in charge to stop others from poaching.
p213
aVAnd when this thing started going on,
p214
aVwe started becoming one community,
p215
aVrenewing our connection to nature.
p216
aVAnd that was a very strong thing in Namibia.
p217
aa(lp218
VThe last element that actually helped develop these things
p219
aVwas the partnerships.
p220
aVOur government has given legal status over our traditional lands.
p221
aVThe other partners that we have got
p222
aVis business communities.
p223
aVBusiness communities helped bring Namibia onto the world map
p224
aVand they have also helped make wildlife
p225
aVa very valuable land use like any other land uses
p226
aVsuch as agriculture.
p227
aVAnd most of my conservation colleagues today
p228
aVthat you find in Namibia
p229
aVhave been trained through the initiative,
p230
aVthrough the involvement of World Wildlife Fund
p231
aVin the most up-to-date conservation practices.
p232
aVThey have also given funding for two decades
p233
aVto this whole program.
p234
aVAnd so far, with the support of World Wildlife Fund,
p235
aVwe've been able to scale up the very small programs
p236
aVto national programs today.
p237
aVNamibia ... or Sesfontein
p238
aVwas no more an isolated village somewhere,
p239
aVhidden away in Namibia.
p240
aVWith these assets we are now part of the global village.
p241
aa(lp242
VThirty years have passed
p243
aVsince my father's first job as a community game guard.
p244
aVIt's very unfortunate that he passed away and he cannot see the success
p245
aVas I and my children see it today.
p246
aVWhen I finished school in 1995,
p247
aVthere were only 20 lions in the entire Northwest \u2014 in our area.
p248
aVBut today, there are more than 130 lions.
p249
aV(Applause)
p250
aVSo please, if you go to Namibia,
p251
aVmake sure that you stay in the tents.
p252
aVDon't walk out at night!
p253
aa(lp254
V(Laughter)
p255
aa(lp256
VThe black rhino \u2014 they were almost extinct in 1982.
p257
aVBut today, Kunene has the largest concentration of black rhino \u2014
p258
aVfree-roaming black rhinos \u2014 in the world.
p259
aVThis is outside the protected area.
p260
aa(lp261
V(Applause)
p262
aa(lp263
VThe leopard \u2014 they are now in big numbers
p264
aVbut they are now far away from our village,
p265
aVbecause the natural plain has multiplied,
p266
aVlike zebras, springboks and everything.
p267
aVThey stay very much far away
p268
aVbecause this other thing has multiplied
p269
aVfrom less than a thousand to tens of thousands of animals.
p270
aa(lp271
VWhat started as very small,
p272
aVcommunity rangers getting community involved,
p273
aVhas now grown into something that we call conservancies.
p274
aVConservancies are legally instituted institutions
p275
aVby the government,
p276
aVand these are run by the communities themselves, for their benefit.
p277
aVToday, we have got 60 conservancies
p278
aVthat manage and protect over 13 million hectares
p279
aVof land in Namibia.
p280
aVWe have already reshaped conservation in the entire country.
p281
aVNowhere else in the world
p282
aVhas community-adopted conservation at this scale.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Applause)
p285
aa(lp286
VIn 2008, conservancy generated 5.7 million dollars.
p287
aVThis is our new economy \u2014
p288
aVan economy based on the respect of our natural resources.
p289
aVAnd we are able to use this money for many things:
p290
aVVery importantly, we put it in education.
p291
aVSecondly, we put it for infrastructure. Food.
p292
aVVery important as well \u2014 we invest this money in AIDS and HIV education.
p293
aVYou know that Africa is being affected by these viruses.
p294
aVAnd this is the good news from Africa
p295
aVthat we have to shout from the rooftops.
p296
aa(lp297
V(Applause)
p298
aa(lp299
VAnd now, what the world really needs
p300
aVis for you to help me and our partners
p301
aVtake some of what we have learned in Namibia
p302
aVto other places with similar problems:
p303
aVplaces like Mongolia,
p304
aVor even in your own backyards,
p305
aVthe Northern Great Plains,
p306
aVwhere buffalo and other animals have suffered
p307
aVand many communities are in decline.
p308
aVI like that one:
p309
aVNamibia serving as a model to Africa,
p310
aVand Africa serving as a model to the United States.
p311
aV(Applause)
p312
aVWe were successful in Namibia
p313
aVbecause we dreamed of a future
p314
aVthat was much more than just a healthy wildlife.
p315
aVWe knew conservation would fail
p316
aVif it doesn't work to improve the lives of the local communities.
p317
aVSo, come and talk to me about Namibia,
p318
aVand better yet, come to Namibia
p319
aVand see for yourself how we have done it.
p320
aVAnd please, do visit our website
p321
aVto learn more and see how you can help CBNRM
p322
aVin Africa and across the world.
p323
aVThank you very much.

It&rsquo;s a standard nature-documentary scenario: a pristine animal habitat under constant threat by the people who live there, hunting, camping, setting fires. But John Kasaona knows there is a better way to see this relationship between people and environment. As the assistant director for the <a href=\\"http://www.irdnc.org.na/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Integrated Rural Development and Nature Conservation (IRDNC)</a> , Kasaona works on ways to improve the lives of rural people in Namibia by involving them in the management of the lands they live on -- and the species that live there with them. </p><p>Kasanoa&#39;s Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) program helps rural villages set up communal conservancies, which manage and use local natural resources in a sustainable manner. Essentially, it&#39;s about restoring the balance of land and people to that of pre-colonial times, and allowing the people with the most interest in the survival of their environment to have control of it.

It&rsquo;s a standard nature-documentary scenario: a pristine animal habitat under constant threat by the people who live there, hunting, camping, setting fires. But John Kasaona knows there is a better way to see this relationship between people and environment. As the assistant director for the <a href=\\"http://www.irdnc.org.na/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Integrated Rural Development and Nature Conservation (IRDNC)</a> , Kasaona works on ways to improve the lives of rural people in Namibia by involving them in the management of the lands they live on -- and the species that live there with them. </p><p>Kasanoa&#39;s Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) program helps rural villages set up communal conservancies, which manage and use local natural resources in a sustainable manner. Essentially, it&#39;s about restoring the balance of land and people to that of pre-colonial times, and allowing the people with the most interest in the survival of their environment to have control of it. His work was featured in the recent film <em>Milking the Rhino</em>.</p><p>The World Wildlife Fund has set up a portal for TEDsters to help in John Kasaona&#39;s work. <a href=\\"http://www.worldwildlife.org/sites/TED/ted.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Learn more &gt;&gt;</a> </p>", "slug": "john_kasaona", "whotheyare": "John Kasaona is a pioneer of community-based conservation -- working with the people who use and live on fragile land to enlist them in protecting it.", "whatotherssay": "Our attitude is important.

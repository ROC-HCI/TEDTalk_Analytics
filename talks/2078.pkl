VMy dream is to build the world's first
p5
aVunderground park in New York City.
p6
aVNow, why would someone want to build an underground park,
p7
aVand why in New York City?
p8
aa(lp9
VThese three tough little buggers
p10
aVare, on the left, my grandmother, age five,
p11
aVand then her sister and brother,
p12
aVages 11 and nine.
p13
aVThis photo was taken just before they left
p14
aVfrom Italy to immigrate to the United States,
p15
aVjust about a century ago.
p16
aVAnd like many immigrants at the time,
p17
aVthey arrived on the Lower East Side
p18
aVin New York City
p19
aVand they encountered a crazy melting pot.
p20
aVWhat was amazing about their generation
p21
aVwas that they were not only building new lives
p22
aVin this new, unfamiliar area,
p23
aVbut they were also literally building the city.
p24
aVI've always been fascinated by those decades
p25
aVand by that history,
p26
aVand I would often beg my grandmother
p27
aVto tell me as many stories as possible
p28
aVabout the old New York.
p29
aVBut she would often just shrug it off,
p30
aVtell me to eat more meatballs, more pasta,
p31
aVand so I very rarely got
p32
aVany of the history that I wanted to hear about.
p33
aa(lp34
VThe New York City that I encountered
p35
aVfelt pretty built up.
p36
aVI always knew as a kid that I wanted
p37
aVto make a difference, and to somehow
p38
aVmake the world more beautiful, more interesting
p39
aVand more just.
p40
aVI just didn't really know how.
p41
aVAt first, I thought I wanted to go work abroad,
p42
aVso I took a job with UNICEF in Kenya.
p43
aVBut it felt weird to me that I knew more about
p44
aVlocal Kenyan politics than the politics of my own hometown.
p45
aVI took a job with the City of New York,
p46
aVbut very quickly felt frustrated
p47
aVwith the slowness of government bureaucracy.
p48
aVI even took a job at Google,
p49
aVwhere very fast I drank the Kool-Aid
p50
aVand believed almost wholeheartedly
p51
aVthat technology could solve all social problems.
p52
aVBut I still didn't feel like I was making the world a better place.
p53
aa(lp54
VIt was in 2009 that my friend
p55
aVand now business partner James Ramsey
p56
aValerted me to the location of a pretty spectacular site,
p57
aVwhich is this.
p58
aVThis is the former trolley terminal
p59
aVthat was the depot for passengers
p60
aVtraveling over the Williamsburg Bridge
p61
aVfrom Brooklyn to Manhattan,
p62
aVand it was open between 1908 and 1948,
p63
aVjust around the time when my grandparents were
p64
aVliving right in the area.
p65
aVAnd we learned also that the site
p66
aVwas entirely abandoned in 1948.
p67
aVFascinated by this discovery,
p68
aVwe begged the authorities to draw us into the space,
p69
aVand we finally got a tour,
p70
aVand this is what we saw.
p71
aVNow, this photo doesn't really do it justice.
p72
aVIt's kind of hard to imagine the unbelievably magical
p73
aVfeeling that you have when you get in this space.
p74
aVIt's a football field of unused land
p75
aVimmediately below a very crowded area of the city,
p76
aVand it almost feels like you're Indiana Jones
p77
aVon an archaeological dig,
p78
aVand all the details are all still there.
p79
aVIt's really pretty remarkable.
p80
aa(lp81
VNow, the site itself is located at the very heart
p82
aVof the Lower East Side,
p83
aVand today it still remains one of the most
p84
aVcrowded neighborhoods in the city.
p85
aVNew York City has two thirds the green space
p86
aVper resident as other big cities,
p87
aVand this neighborhood as one tenth the green space.
p88
aVSo we immediately started thinking about how we
p89
aVcould take this site and turn it into something
p90
aVthat could be used for the public,
p91
aVbut also could potentially even be green.
p92
aVOur plan, in a nutshell,
p93
aVis to draw natural sunlight underground
p94
aVusing a simple system that harvests sunlight above the street,
p95
aVdirects it below the city sidewalks,
p96
aVand would allow plants and trees to grow
p97
aVwith the light that's directed underneath.
p98
aVWith this approach, you could take a site
p99
aVthat looks like this today
p100
aVand transform it into something
p101
aVthat looks like this.
p102
aa(lp103
VIn 2011, we first released some of these images,
p104
aVand what was funny was,
p105
aVa lot of people said to us, "Oh, it kind of looks
p106
aVlike the High Line underground."
p107
aVAnd so what our nickname ended up becoming,
p108
aVand what ended up sticking,
p109
aVwas the Lowline, so the Lowline was born.
p110
aVWhat was also clear was that people really wanted
p111
aVto know a lot more about how the technology
p112
aVwould look and feel,
p113
aVand that there was really much more interest in this
p114
aVthan we had ever thought possible.
p115
aVSo, like a crazy person, I decided to quit my job
p116
aVand focus entirely on this project.
p117
aVHere is us with our team
p118
aVputting together a technology demonstration
p119
aVin a warehouse.
p120
aVHere's the underbelly of this solar canopy
p121
aVwhich we built to show the technology.
p122
aVYou can see the six solar collectors at the center there.
p123
aVAnd here's the full exhibit all put together
p124
aVin this warehouse.
p125
aVYou can see the solar canopy overhead,
p126
aVthe light streaming in,
p127
aVand this entirely live green space below.
p128
aVSo in the course of just a few weeks,
p129
aVtens of thousands of people came to see our exhibit,
p130
aVand since that time, we've grown
p131
aVour numbers of supporters both locally
p132
aVand among design enthusiasts all over the world.
p133
aa(lp134
VHere's a rendering of the neighborhood
p135
aVjust immediately above the Line's site,
p136
aVand a rendering of how it will look
p137
aVafter major redevelopment that is coming
p138
aVover the course of the next 10 years.
p139
aVNotice how crowded the neighborhood still feels
p140
aVand how there's really a lack of green space.
p141
aVSo what we're proposing is really something that will
p142
aVadd one football field of green space
p143
aVunderneath this neighborhood, but more importantly
p144
aVwill introduce a really community-driven focus
p145
aVin a rapidly gentrifying area.
p146
aVAnd right now, we're focusing very closely
p147
aVon how we engage with the City of New York
p148
aVon really transforming the overall ecosystem
p149
aVin an integrated way.
p150
aa(lp151
VHere's our rendering of how we would actually
p152
aVinvite people into the space itself.
p153
aVSo here you see this iconic entrance
p154
aVin which we would literally peel up the street
p155
aVand reveal the historical layers of the city,
p156
aVand invite people into this warm underground space.
p157
aVIn the middle of winter, when it's absolutely freezing outside,
p158
aVthe last place you'd want to go would be
p159
aVan outdoor space or outdoor park.
p160
aVThe Lowline would really be a four-season space
p161
aVand a respite for the city.
p162
aVSo I like to think that the Lowline actually brings
p163
aVmy own family's story full circle.
p164
aVIf my grandparents and my parents were really
p165
aVfocused on building the city up and out,
p166
aVI think my generation is focused on reclaiming
p167
aVthe spaces that we already have,
p168
aVrediscovering our shared history,
p169
aVand reimagining how we can make our communities
p170
aVmore interesting, more beautiful and more just.
p171
aa(lp172
VThanks.

director of the Lowline, an underground park that is being developed underneath the streets of New York City&mdash;in the Williamsburg Bridge Trolley Terminal. In use from 1908 to 1948, this terminal is now abandoned. The Lowline will be a one-acre park in a neighborhood where greenspace is hard to come by. The project uses innovative solar technology to capture light above ground and distribute it below, making it a space that can be used in all four seasons. Once a wild idea, the project got a big boost on Kickstarter, raising more than $155,000 for its development in 2012. The project promises to be the inverse of New York&#39;s High Line.</p>  <p>Barasch has long known that he wanted to make a difference, but for years, wasn&#39;t quite sure how to go about doing that. Before he left his job to work fultime on the Lowline, he led strategic partnerships at PopTech; held multiple roles at Google; and worked in small business development in New York City government. He also consulted for UNICEF in Nairobi and with the 9/11 Survivors&rsquo; Fund in Washington DC. He began his career at the World Affairs Council in San Francisco, co-producing the weekly NPR show &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Your World.&rdquo;</p>", "slug": "daniel_barasch", "whotheyare": "Dan Barasch\\u2019s grandmother grew up in New York\\u2019s Lower East Side.

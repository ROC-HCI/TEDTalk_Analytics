VSteve Ramirez: My first year of grad school,
p5
aVI found myself in my bedroom
p6
aVeating lots of Ben & Jerry's
p7
aVwatching some trashy TV
p8
aVand maybe, maybe listening to Taylor Swift.
p9
aVI had just gone through a breakup.
p10
aV(Laughter)
p11
aVSo for the longest time, all I would do
p12
aVis recall the memory of this person over and over again,
p13
aVwishing that I could get rid of that gut-wrenching,
p14
aVvisceral "blah" feeling.
p15
aVNow, as it turns out, I'm a neuroscientist,
p16
aVso I knew that the memory of that person
p17
aVand the awful, emotional undertones that color in that memory,
p18
aVare largely mediated by separate brain systems.
p19
aVAnd so I thought, what if we could go into the brain
p20
aVand edit out that nauseating feeling
p21
aVbut while keeping the memory of that person intact?
p22
aVThen I realized, maybe that's a little bit lofty for now.
p23
aVSo what if we could start off by going into the brain
p24
aVand just finding a single memory to begin with?
p25
aVCould we jump-start that memory back to life,
p26
aVmaybe even play with the contents of that memory?
p27
aVAll that said, there is one person in the entire world right now
p28
aVthat I really hope is not watching this talk.
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aVSo there is a catch. There is a catch.
p31
aVThese ideas probably remind you of "Total Recall,"
p32
aV"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"
p33
aVor of "Inception."
p34
aVBut the movie stars that we work with
p35
aVare the celebrities of the lab.
p36
aVXu Liu: Test mice.
p37
aV(Laughter)
p38
aVAs neuroscientists, we work in the lab with mice
p39
aVtrying to understand how memory works.
p40
aVAnd today, we hope to convince you that now
p41
aVwe are actually able to activate a memory in the brain
p42
aVat the speed of light.
p43
aVTo do this, there's only two simple steps to follow.
p44
aVFirst, you find and label a memory in the brain,
p45
aVand then you activate it with a switch.
p46
aVAs simple as that.
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aVSR: Are you convinced?
p49
aVSo, turns out finding a memory in the brain isn't all that easy.
p50
aVXL: Indeed. This is way more difficult than, let's say,
p51
aVfinding a needle in a haystack,
p52
aVbecause at least, you know, the needle is still something
p53
aVyou can physically put your fingers on.
p54
aVBut memory is not.
p55
aVAnd also, there's way more cells in your brain
p56
aVthan the number of straws in a typical haystack.
p57
aVSo yeah, this task does seem to be daunting.
p58
aVBut luckily, we got help from the brain itself.
p59
aVIt turned out that all we need to do is basically
p60
aVto let the brain form a memory,
p61
aVand then the brain will tell us which cells are involved
p62
aVin that particular memory.
p63
aVSR: So what was going on in my brain
p64
aVwhile I was recalling the memory of an ex?
p65
aVIf you were to just completely ignore human ethics for a second
p66
aVand slice up my brain right now,
p67
aVyou would see that there was an amazing number
p68
aVof brain regions that were active while recalling that memory.
p69
aVNow one brain region that would be robustly active
p70
aVin particular is called the hippocampus,
p71
aVwhich for decades has been implicated in processing
p72
aVthe kinds of memories that we hold near and dear,
p73
aVwhich also makes it an ideal target to go into
p74
aVand to try and find and maybe reactivate a memory.
p75
aVXL: When you zoom in into the hippocampus,
p76
aVof course you will see lots of cells,
p77
aVbut we are able to find which cells are involved
p78
aVin a particular memory,
p79
aVbecause whenever a cell is active,
p80
aVlike when it's forming a memory,
p81
aVit will also leave a footprint that will later allow us to know
p82
aVthese cells are recently active.
p83
aVSR: So the same way that building lights at night
p84
aVlet you know that somebody's probably working there at any given moment,
p85
aVin a very real sense, there are biological sensors
p86
aVwithin a cell that are turned on
p87
aVonly when that cell was just working.
p88
aVThey're sort of biological windows that light up
p89
aVto let us know that that cell was just active.
p90
aVXL: So we clipped part of this sensor,
p91
aVand attached that to a switch to control the cells,
p92
aVand we packed this switch into an engineered virus
p93
aVand injected that into the brain of the mice.
p94
aVSo whenever a memory is being formed,
p95
aVany active cells for that memory
p96
aVwill also have this switch installed.
p97
aVSR: So here is what the hippocampus looks like
p98
aVafter forming a fear memory, for example.
p99
aVThe sea of blue that you see here
p100
aVare densely packed brain cells,
p101
aVbut the green brain cells,
p102
aVthe green brain cells are the ones that are holding on
p103
aVto a specific fear memory.
p104
aVSo you are looking at the crystallization
p105
aVof the fleeting formation of fear.
p106
aVYou're actually looking at the cross-section of a memory right now.
p107
aVXL: Now, for the switch we have been talking about,
p108
aVideally, the switch has to act really fast.
p109
aVIt shouldn't take minutes or hours to work.
p110
aVIt should act at the speed of the brain, in milliseconds.
p111
aVSR: So what do you think, Xu?
p112
aVCould we use, let's say, pharmacological drugs
p113
aVto activate or inactivate brain cells?
p114
aVXL: Nah. Drugs are pretty messy. They spread everywhere.
p115
aVAnd also it takes them forever to act on cells.
p116
aVSo it will not allow us to control a memory in real time.
p117
aVSo Steve, how about let's zap the brain with electricity?
p118
aVSR: So electricity is pretty fast,
p119
aVbut we probably wouldn't be able to target it
p120
aVto just the specific cells that hold onto a memory,
p121
aVand we'd probably fry the brain.
p122
aVXL: Oh. That's true. So it looks like, hmm,
p123
aVindeed we need to find a better way
p124
aVto impact the brain at the speed of light.
p125
aVSR: So it just so happens that light travels at the speed of light.
p126
aVSo maybe we could activate or inactive memories
p127
aVby just using light \u2014
p128
aVXL: That's pretty fast.
p129
aVSR: \u2014 and because normally brain cells
p130
aVdon't respond to pulses of light,
p131
aVso those that would respond to pulses of light
p132
aVare those that contain a light-sensitive switch.
p133
aVNow to do that, first we need to trick brain cells
p134
aVto respond to laser beams.
p135
aVXL: Yep. You heard it right.
p136
aVWe are trying to shoot lasers into the brain.
p137
aV(Laughter)
p138
aVSR: And the technique that lets us do that is optogenetics.
p139
aVOptogenetics gave us this light switch that we can use
p140
aVto turn brain cells on or off,
p141
aVand the name of that switch is channelrhodopsin,
p142
aVseen here as these green dots attached to this brain cell.
p143
aVYou can think of channelrhodopsin as a sort of light-sensitive switch
p144
aVthat can be artificially installed in brain cells
p145
aVso that now we can use that switch
p146
aVto activate or inactivate the brain cell simply by clicking it,
p147
aVand in this case we click it on with pulses of light.
p148
aVXL: So we attach this light-sensitive switch of channelrhodopsin
p149
aVto the sensor we've been talking about
p150
aVand inject this into the brain.
p151
aVSo whenever a memory is being formed,
p152
aVany active cell for that particular memory
p153
aVwill also have this light-sensitive switch installed in it
p154
aVso that we can control these cells
p155
aVby the flipping of a laser just like this one you see.
p156
aVSR: So let's put all of this to the test now.
p157
aVWhat we can do is we can take our mice
p158
aVand then we can put them in a box that looks exactly like this box here,
p159
aVand then we can give them a very mild foot shock
p160
aVso that they form a fear memory of this box.
p161
aVThey learn that something bad happened here.
p162
aVNow with our system, the cells that are active
p163
aVin the hippocampus in the making of this memory,
p164
aVonly those cells will now contain channelrhodopsin.
p165
aVXL: When you are as small as a mouse,
p166
aVit feels as if the whole world is trying to get you.
p167
aVSo your best response of defense
p168
aVis trying to be undetected.
p169
aVWhenever a mouse is in fear,
p170
aVit will show this very typical behavior
p171
aVby staying at one corner of the box,
p172
aVtrying to not move any part of its body,
p173
aVand this posture is called freezing.
p174
aVSo if a mouse remembers that something bad happened in this box,
p175
aVand when we put them back into the same box,
p176
aVit will basically show freezing
p177
aVbecause it doesn't want to be detected
p178
aVby any potential threats in this box.
p179
aVSR: So you can think of freezing as,
p180
aVyou're walking down the street minding your own business,
p181
aVand then out of nowhere you almost run into
p182
aVan ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend,
p183
aVand now those terrifying two seconds
p184
aVwhere you start thinking, "What do I do? Do I say hi?
p185
aVDo I shake their hand? Do I turn around and run away?
p186
aVDo I sit here and pretend like I don't exist?"
p187
aVThose kinds of fleeting thoughts that physically incapacitate you,
p188
aVthat temporarily give you that deer-in-headlights look.
p189
aVXL: However, if you put the mouse in a completely different
p190
aVnew box, like the next one,
p191
aVit will not be afraid of this box
p192
aVbecause there's no reason that it will be afraid of this new environment.
p193
aVBut what if we put the mouse in this new box
p194
aVbut at the same time, we activate the fear memory
p195
aVusing lasers just like we did before?
p196
aVAre we going to bring back the fear memory
p197
aVfor the first box into this completely new environment?
p198
aVSR: All right, and here's the million-dollar experiment.
p199
aVNow to bring back to life the memory of that day,
p200
aVI remember that the Red Sox had just won,
p201
aVit was a green spring day,
p202
aVperfect for going up and down the river
p203
aVand then maybe going to the North End
p204
aVto get some cannolis, #justsaying.
p205
aVNow Xu and I, on the other hand,
p206
aVwere in a completely windowless black room
p207
aVnot making any ocular movement that even remotely resembles an eye blink
p208
aVbecause our eyes were fixed onto a computer screen.
p209
aVWe were looking at this mouse here trying to activate a memory
p210
aVfor the first time using our technique.
p211
aVXL: And this is what we saw.
p212
aVWhen we first put the mouse into this box,
p213
aVit's exploring, sniffing around, walking around,
p214
aVminding its own business,
p215
aVbecause actually by nature,
p216
aVmice are pretty curious animals.
p217
aVThey want to know, what's going on in this new box?
p218
aVIt's interesting.
p219
aVBut the moment we turned on the laser, like you see now,
p220
aVall of a sudden the mouse entered this freezing mode.
p221
aVIt stayed here and tried not to move any part of its body.
p222
aVClearly it's freezing.
p223
aVSo indeed, it looks like we are able to bring back
p224
aVthe fear memory for the first box
p225
aVin this completely new environment.
p226
aVWhile watching this, Steve and I
p227
aVare as shocked as the mouse itself.
p228
aV(Laughter)
p229
aVSo after the experiment, the two of us just left the room
p230
aVwithout saying anything.
p231
aVAfter a kind of long, awkward period of time,
p232
aVSteve broke the silence.
p233
aVSR: "Did that just work?"
p234
aVXL: "Yes," I said. "Indeed it worked!"
p235
aVWe're really excited about this.
p236
aVAnd then we published our findings
p237
aVin the journal Nature.
p238
aVEver since the publication of our work,
p239
aVwe've been receiving numerous comments
p240
aVfrom all over the Internet.
p241
aVMaybe we can take a look at some of those.
p242
aV["OMGGGGG FINALLY... so much more to come, virtual reality, neural manipulation, visual dream emulation... neural coding, 'writing and re-writing of memories', mental illnesses. Ahhh the future is awesome"]
p243
aVSR: So the first thing that you'll notice is that people
p244
aVhave really strong opinions about this kind of work.
p245
aVNow I happen to completely agree with the optimism
p246
aVof this first quote,
p247
aVbecause on a scale of zero to Morgan Freeman's voice,
p248
aVit happens to be one of the most evocative accolades
p249
aVthat I've heard come our way.
p250
aV(Laughter)
p251
aVBut as you'll see, it's not the only opinion that's out there.
p252
aV["This scares the hell out of me... What if they could do that easily in humans in a couple of years?! OH MY GOD WE'RE DOOMED"]
p253
aVXL: Indeed, if we take a look at the second one,
p254
aVI think we can all agree that it's, meh,
p255
aVprobably not as positive.
p256
aVBut this also reminds us that,
p257
aValthough we are still working with mice,
p258
aVit's probably a good idea to start thinking and discussing
p259
aVabout the possible ethical ramifications
p260
aVof memory control.
p261
aVSR: Now, in the spirit of the third quote,
p262
aVwe want to tell you about a recent project that we've been
p263
aVworking on in lab that we've called Project Inception.
p264
aV["They should make a movie about this. Where they plant ideas into peoples minds, so they can control them for their own personal gain. We'll call it: Inception."]
p265
aVSo we reasoned that now that we can reactivate a memory,
p266
aVwhat if we do so but then begin to tinker with that memory?
p267
aVCould we possibly even turn it into a false memory?
p268
aVXL: So all memory is sophisticated and dynamic,
p269
aVbut if just for simplicity, let's imagine memory
p270
aVas a movie clip.
p271
aVSo far what we've told you is basically we can control
p272
aVthis "play" button of the clip
p273
aVso that we can play this video clip any time, anywhere.
p274
aVBut is there a possibility that we can actually get
p275
aVinside the brain and edit this movie clip
p276
aVso that we can make it different from the original?
p277
aVYes we can.
p278
aVTurned out that all we need to do is basically
p279
aVreactivate a memory using lasers just like we did before,
p280
aVbut at the same time, if we present new information
p281
aVand allow this new information to incorporate into this old memory,
p282
aVthis will change the memory.
p283
aVIt's sort of like making a remix tape.
p284
aVSR: So how do we do this?
p285
aVRather than finding a fear memory in the brain,
p286
aVwe can start by taking our animals,
p287
aVand let's say we put them in a blue box like this blue box here
p288
aVand we find the brain cells that represent that blue box
p289
aVand we trick them to respond to pulses of light
p290
aVexactly like we had said before.
p291
aVNow the next day, we can take our animals and place them
p292
aVin a red box that they've never experienced before.
p293
aVWe can shoot light into the brain to reactivate
p294
aVthe memory of the blue box.
p295
aVSo what would happen here if, while the animal
p296
aVis recalling the memory of the blue box,
p297
aVwe gave it a couple of mild foot shocks?
p298
aVSo here we're trying to artificially make an association
p299
aVbetween the memory of the blue box
p300
aVand the foot shocks themselves.
p301
aVWe're just trying to connect the two.
p302
aVSo to test if we had done so,
p303
aVwe can take our animals once again
p304
aVand place them back in the blue box.
p305
aVAgain, we had just reactivated the memory of the blue box
p306
aVwhile the animal got a couple of mild foot shocks,
p307
aVand now the animal suddenly freezes.
p308
aVIt's as though it's recalling being mildly shocked in this environment
p309
aVeven though that never actually happened.
p310
aVSo it formed a false memory,
p311
aVbecause it's falsely fearing an environment
p312
aVwhere, technically speaking,
p313
aVnothing bad actually happened to it.
p314
aVXL: So, so far we are only talking about
p315
aVthis light-controlled "on" switch.
p316
aVIn fact, we also have a light-controlled "off" switch,
p317
aVand it's very easy to imagine that
p318
aVby installing this light-controlled "off" switch,
p319
aVwe can also turn off a memory, any time, anywhere.
p320
aVSo everything we've been talking about today
p321
aVis based on this philosophically charged principle of neuroscience
p322
aVthat the mind, with its seemingly mysterious properties,
p323
aVis actually made of physical stuff that we can tinker with.
p324
aVSR: And for me personally,
p325
aVI see a world where we can reactivate
p326
aVany kind of memory that we'd like.
p327
aVI also see a world where we can erase unwanted memories.
p328
aVNow, I even see a world where editing memories
p329
aVis something of a reality,
p330
aVbecause we're living in a time where it's possible
p331
aVto pluck questions from the tree of science fiction
p332
aVand to ground them in experimental reality.
p333
aVXL: Nowadays, people in the lab
p334
aVand people in other groups all over the world
p335
aVare using similar methods to activate or edit memories,
p336
aVwhether that's old or new, positive or negative,
p337
aVall sorts of memories so that we can understand
p338
aVhow memory works.
p339
aVSR: For example, one group in our lab
p340
aVwas able to find the brain cells that make up a fear memory
p341
aVand converted them into a pleasurable memory, just like that.
p342
aVThat's exactly what I mean about editing these kinds of processes.
p343
aVNow one dude in lab was even able to reactivate
p344
aVmemories of female mice in male mice,
p345
aVwhich rumor has it is a pleasurable experience.
p346
aVXL: Indeed, we are living in a very exciting moment
p347
aVwhere science doesn't have any arbitrary speed limits
p348
aVbut is only bound by our own imagination.
p349
aVSR: And finally, what do we make of all this?
p350
aVHow do we push this technology forward?
p351
aVThese are the questions that should not remain
p352
aVjust inside the lab,
p353
aVand so one goal of today's talk was to bring everybody
p354
aVup to speed with the kind of stuff that's possible
p355
aVin modern neuroscience,
p356
aVbut now, just as importantly,
p357
aVto actively engage everybody in this conversation.
p358
aVSo let's think together as a team about what this all means
p359
aVand where we can and should go from here,
p360
aVbecause Xu and I think we all have
p361
aVsome really big decisions ahead of us.
p362
aVThank you. XL: Thank you.

VToday, I'd like to talk with you
p5
aVabout something that should be a totally uncontroversial topic.
p6
aVBut, unfortunately, it's become incredibly controversial.
p7
aa(lp8
VThis year, if you think about it,
p9
aVover a billion couples will have sex with one another.
p10
aVCouples like this one,
p11
aVand this one,
p12
aVand this one,
p13
aVand, yes,
p14
aVeven this one.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd my idea is this \u2014
p19
aVall these men and women should be free to decide
p20
aVwhether they do or do not want to conceive a child.
p21
aVAnd they should be able to use one of these birth control methods
p22
aVto act on their decision.
p23
aVNow, I think you'd have a hard time
p24
aVfinding many people who disagree with this idea.
p25
aVOver one billion people use birth control without any hesitation at all.
p26
aVThey want the power to plan their own lives
p27
aVand to raise healthier, better educated and more prosperous families.
p28
aa(lp29
VBut, for an idea that is so broadly accepted in private,
p30
aVbirth control certainly generates a lot of opposition in public.
p31
aVSome people think when we talk about contraception
p32
aVthat it's code for abortion,
p33
aVwhich it's not.
p34
aVSome people \u2014 let's be honest \u2014
p35
aVthey're uncomfortable with the topic because it's about sex.
p36
aVSome people worry
p37
aVthat the real goal of family planning is to control populations.
p38
aVThese are all side issues
p39
aVthat have attached themselves to this core idea that men and women
p40
aVshould be able to decide when they want to have a child.
p41
aVAnd as a result, birth control has almost completely and totally disappeared
p42
aVfrom the global health agenda.
p43
aa(lp44
VThe victims of this paralysis are the people of sub-Saharan Africa
p45
aVand South Asia.
p46
aVHere in Germany, the proportion of people that use contraception
p47
aVis about 66 percent.
p48
aVThat's about what you'd expect.
p49
aVIn El Salvador, very similar, 66 percent.
p50
aVThailand, 64 percent.
p51
aVBut let's compare that to other places,
p52
aVlike Uttar Pradesh, one of the largest states in India.
p53
aVIn fact, if Uttar Pradesh was its own country,
p54
aVit would be the fifth largest country in the world.
p55
aVTheir contraception rate \u2014 29 percent.
p56
aVNigeria, the most populous country in Africa, 10 percent.
p57
aVChad, 2 percent.
p58
aVLet's just take one country in Africa, Senegal.
p59
aVTheir rate is about 12 percent.
p60
aa(lp61
VBut why is it so low?
p62
aVOne reason is that the most popular contraceptives are rarely available.
p63
aVWomen in Africa will tell you over and over again
p64
aVthat what they prefer today is an injectable.
p65
aVThey get it in their arm \u2014 and they go about four times a year,
p66
aVthey have to get it every three months \u2014 to get their injection.
p67
aVThe reason women like it so much in Africa is they can hide it from their husbands,
p68
aVwho sometimes want a lot of children.
p69
aVThe problem is every other time a woman goes into a clinic in Senegal,
p70
aVthat injection is stocked out.
p71
aVIt's stocked out 150 days out of the year.
p72
aVSo can you imagine the situation \u2014
p73
aVshe walks all this way to go get her injection.
p74
aVShe leaves her field, sometimes leaves her children,
p75
aVand it's not there.
p76
aVAnd she doesn't know when it's going to be available again.
p77
aVThis is the same story across the continent of Africa today.
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd so what we've created as a world has become a life-and-death crisis.
p80
aVThere are 100,000 women [per year] who say they don't want to be pregnant
p81
aVand they die in childbirth \u2014 100,000 women a year.
p82
aVThere are another 600,000 women [per year]
p83
aVwho say they didn't want to be pregnant in the first place,
p84
aVand they give birth to a baby
p85
aVand her baby dies in that first month of life.
p86
aVI know everyone wants to save these mothers and these children.
p87
aVBut somewhere along the way, we got confused by our own conversation.
p88
aVAnd we stopped trying to save these lives.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo if we're going to make progress on this issue,
p91
aVwe have to be really clear about what our agenda is.
p92
aVWe're not talking about abortion.
p93
aVWe're not talking about population control.
p94
aVWhat I'm talking about is giving women the power to save their lives,
p95
aVto save their children's lives
p96
aVand to give their families the best possible future.
p97
aa(lp98
VNow, as a world,
p99
aVthere are lots of things we have to do in the global health community
p100
aVif we want to make the world better in the future \u2014
p101
aVthings like fight diseases.
p102
aVSo many children today die of diarrhea, as you heard earlier, and pneumonia.
p103
aVThey kill literally millions of children a year.
p104
aVWe also need to help small farmers \u2014
p105
aVfarmers who plow small plots of land in Africa \u2014
p106
aVso that they can grow enough food to feed their children.
p107
aVAnd we have to make sure that children are educated around the world.
p108
aVBut one of the simplest and most transformative things we can do
p109
aVis to give everybody access to birth control methods
p110
aVthat almost all Germans have access to and all Americans, at some point,
p111
aVthey use these tools during their life.
p112
aVAnd I think as long as we're really clear about what our agenda is,
p113
aVthere's a global movement waiting to happen
p114
aVand ready to get behind this totally uncontroversial idea.
p115
aa(lp116
VWhen I grew up, I grew up in a Catholic home.
p117
aVI still consider myself a practicing Catholic.
p118
aVMy mom's great-uncle was a Jesuit priest.
p119
aVMy great-aunt was a Dominican nun.
p120
aVShe was a schoolteacher and a principal her entire life.
p121
aVIn fact, she's the one who taught me as a young girl how to read.
p122
aVI was very close to her.
p123
aVAnd I went to Catholic schools for my entire childhood
p124
aVuntil I left home to go to university.
p125
aVIn my high school, Ursuline Academy,
p126
aVthe nuns made service and social justice a high priority in the school.
p127
aVToday, in the [Gates] Foundation's work,
p128
aVI believe I'm applying the lessons that I learned in high school.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo, in the tradition of Catholic scholars,
p131
aVthe nuns also taught us to question received teachings.
p132
aVAnd one of the teachings that we girls and my peers questioned
p133
aVwas is birth control really a sin?
p134
aVBecause I think one of the reasons
p135
aVwe have this huge discomfort talking about contraception
p136
aVis this lingering concern
p137
aVthat if we separate sex from reproduction, we're going to promote promiscuity.
p138
aVAnd I think that's a reasonable question to be asked about contraception \u2014
p139
aVwhat is its impact on sexual morality?
p140
aa(lp141
VBut, like most women,
p142
aVmy decision about birth control had nothing to do with promiscuity.
p143
aVI had a plan for my future. I wanted to go to college.
p144
aVI studied really hard in college,
p145
aVand I was proud to be one of the very few female computer science graduates
p146
aVat my university.
p147
aVI wanted to have a career, so I went on to business school
p148
aVand I became one of the youngest female executives at Microsoft.
p149
aa(lp150
VI still remember, though, when I left my parents' home
p151
aVto move across the country to start this new job at Microsoft.
p152
aVThey had sacrificed a lot to give me five years of higher education.
p153
aVBut they said, as I left home \u2014
p154
aVand I literally went down the front steps, down the porch at home \u2014
p155
aVand they said,
p156
aV"Even though you've had this great education,
p157
aVif you decide to get married and have kids right away,
p158
aVthat's OK by us, too."
p159
aVThey wanted me to do the thing that would make me the very happiest.
p160
aVI was free to decide what that would be.
p161
aVIt was an amazing feeling.
p162
aa(lp163
VIn fact, I did want to have kids \u2014
p164
aVbut I wanted to have them when I was ready.
p165
aVAnd so now, Bill and I have three.
p166
aVAnd when our eldest daughter was born,
p167
aVwe weren't, I would say, exactly sure how to be great parents.
p168
aVMaybe some of you know that feeling.
p169
aVAnd so we waited a little while before we had our second child.
p170
aVAnd it's no accident that we have three children
p171
aVthat are spaced three years apart.
p172
aVNow, as a mother, what do I want the very most for my children?
p173
aVI want them to feel the way I did \u2014
p174
aVlike they can do anything they want to do in life.
p175
aVAnd so, what has struck me
p176
aVas I've travelled the last decade for the foundation around the world
p177
aVis that all women want that same thing.
p178
aa(lp179
VLast year, I was in Nairobi, in the slums, in one called Korogocho \u2014
p180
aVwhich literally means when translated, "standing shoulder to shoulder."
p181
aVAnd I spoke with this women's group that's pictured here.
p182
aVAnd the women talked very openly about their family life in the slums,
p183
aVwhat it was like.
p184
aVAnd they talked quite intimately about what they did for birth control.
p185
aVMarianne, in the center of the screen in the red sweater,
p186
aVshe summed up that entire two-hour conversation
p187
aVin a phrase that I will never forget.
p188
aVShe said, "I want to bring every good thing to this child
p189
aVbefore I have another."
p190
aVAnd I thought \u2014 that's it.
p191
aVThat's universal.
p192
aVWe all want to bring every good thing to our children.
p193
aa(lp194
VBut what's not universal is our ability to provide every good thing.
p195
aVSo many women suffer from domestic violence.
p196
aVAnd they can't even broach the subject of contraception,
p197
aVeven inside their own marriage.
p198
aVThere are many women who lack basic education.
p199
aVEven many of the women who do have knowledge and do have power
p200
aVdon't have access to contraceptives.
p201
aa(lp202
VFor 250 years, parents around the world
p203
aVhave been deciding to have smaller families.
p204
aVThis trend has been steady for a quarter of a millennium,
p205
aVacross cultures and across geographies,
p206
aVwith the glaring exception of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
p207
aVThe French started bringing down their family size in the mid-1700s.
p208
aVAnd over the next 150 years, this trend spread all across Europe.
p209
aVThe surprising thing to me, as I learned this history,
p210
aVwas that it spread not along socioeconomic lines but around cultural lines.
p211
aVPeople who spoke the same language made that change as a group.
p212
aVThey made the same choice for their family,
p213
aVwhether they were rich or whether they were poor.
p214
aVThe reason that trend toward smaller families spread
p215
aVwas that this whole way was driven by an idea \u2014
p216
aVthe idea that couples can exercise conscious control
p217
aVover how many children they have.
p218
aVThis is a very powerful idea.
p219
aVIt means that parents have the ability to affect the future,
p220
aVnot just accept it as it is.
p221
aa(lp222
VIn France, the average family size went down every decade
p223
aVfor 150 years in a row until it stabilized.
p224
aVIt took so long back then because the contraceptives weren't that good.
p225
aVIn Germany, this transition started in the 1880s, and it took just 50 years
p226
aVfor family size to stabilize in this country.
p227
aVAnd in Asia and Latin America, the transition started in the 1960s,
p228
aVand it happened much faster because of modern contraception.
p229
aa(lp230
VI think, as we go through this history, it's important to pause for a moment
p231
aVand to remember why this has become such a contentious issue.
p232
aVIt's because some family planning programs
p233
aVresorted to unfortunate incentives and coercive policies.
p234
aVFor instance, in the 1960s, India adopted very specific numeric targets
p235
aVand they paid women to accept having an IUD placed in their bodies.
p236
aVNow, Indian women were really smart in this situation.
p237
aVWhen they went to get an IUD inserted, they got paid six rupees.
p238
aVAnd so what did they do?
p239
aVThey waited a few hours or a few days,
p240
aVand they went to another service provider and had the IUD removed for one rupee.
p241
aVFor decades in the United States,
p242
aVAfrican-American women were sterilized without their consent.
p243
aVThe procedure was so common
p244
aVit became known as the Mississippi appendectomy \u2014
p245
aVa tragic chapter in my country's history.
p246
aVAnd as recently as the 1990s, in Peru,
p247
aVwomen from the Andes region were given anesthesia
p248
aVand they were sterilized without their knowledge.
p249
aa(lp250
VThe most startling thing about this
p251
aVis that these coercive policies weren't even needed.
p252
aVThey were carried out in places
p253
aVwhere parents already wanted to lower their family size.
p254
aVBecause in region after region, again and again,
p255
aVparents have wanted to have smaller families.
p256
aVThere's no reason to believe
p257
aVthat African women have innately different desires.
p258
aVGiven the option, they will have fewer children.
p259
aVThe question is:
p260
aVwill we invest in helping all women get what they want now?
p261
aVOr, are we going to condemn them to some century-long struggle,
p262
aVas if this was still revolutionary France
p263
aVand the best method was coitus interruptus?
p264
aa(lp265
VEmpowering parents \u2014 it doesn't need justification.
p266
aVBut here's the thing \u2014 our desire to bring every good thing to our children
p267
aVis a force for good throughout the world.
p268
aVIt's what propels societies forward.
p269
aVIn that same slum in Nairobi, I met a young businesswoman,
p270
aVand she was making backpacks out of her home.
p271
aVShe and her young kids would go to the local jeans factory
p272
aVand collect scraps of denim.
p273
aVShe'd create these backpacks and resell them.
p274
aVAnd when I talked with her, she had three children,
p275
aVand I asked her about her family.
p276
aVAnd she said she and her husband decided
p277
aVthat they wanted to stop having children after their third one.
p278
aVAnd so when I asked her why, she simply said,
p279
aV"Well, because I couldn't run my business if I had another child."
p280
aVAnd she explained the income that she was getting out of her business
p281
aVafforded her to be able to give an education to all three of her children.
p282
aVShe was incredibly optimistic about her family's future.
p283
aVThis is the same mental calculus
p284
aVthat hundreds of millions of men and women have gone through.
p285
aVAnd evidence proves that they have it exactly right.
p286
aVThey are able to give their children more opportunities
p287
aVby exercising control over when they have them.
p288
aa(lp289
VIn Bangladesh,
p290
aVthere's a district called Matlab.
p291
aVIt's where researchers have collected data on over 180,000 inhabitants since 1963.
p292
aVIn the global health community,
p293
aVwe like to say it's one of the longest pieces of research that's been running.
p294
aVWe have so many great health statistics.
p295
aVIn one of the studies, what did they do?
p296
aVHalf the villagers were chosen to get contraceptives.
p297
aVThey got education and access to contraception.
p298
aVTwenty years later, following those villages,
p299
aVwhat we learned is that they had a better quality of life than their neighbors.
p300
aVThe families were healthier.
p301
aVThe women were less likely to die in childbirth.
p302
aVTheir children were less likely to die in the first thirty days of life.
p303
aVThe children were better nourished.
p304
aVThe families were also wealthier.
p305
aVThe adult women's wages were higher.
p306
aVHouseholds had more assets \u2014 things like livestock or land or savings.
p307
aVFinally, their sons and daughters had more schooling.
p308
aVSo when you multiply these types of effects over millions of families,
p309
aVthe product can be large-scale economic development.
p310
aVPeople talk about the Asian economic miracle of the 1980s \u2014
p311
aVbut it wasn't really a miracle.
p312
aVOne of the leading causes of economic growth across that region
p313
aVwas this cultural trend towards smaller families.
p314
aa(lp315
VSweeping changes start at the individual family level \u2014
p316
aVthe family making a decision about what's best for their children.
p317
aVWhen they make that change and that decision,
p318
aVthose become sweeping regional and national trends.
p319
aVWhen families in sub-Saharan Africa are given the opportunity
p320
aVto make those decisions for themselves,
p321
aVI think it will help spark a virtuous cycle of development
p322
aVin communities across the continent.
p323
aVWe can help poor families build a better future.
p324
aVWe can insist that all people have the opportunity
p325
aVto learn about contraceptives
p326
aVand have access to the full variety of methods.
p327
aa(lp328
VI think the goal here is really clear:
p329
aVuniversal access to birth control that women want.
p330
aVAnd for that to happen, it means that both rich and poor governments alike
p331
aVmust make contraception a total priority.
p332
aVWe can do our part, in this room and globally,
p333
aVby talking about the hundreds of millions of families
p334
aVthat don't have access to contraception today
p335
aVand what it would do to change their lives if they did have access.
p336
aa(lp337
VI think if Marianne and the members of her women's group
p338
aVcan talk about this openly
p339
aVand have this discussion out amongst themselves and in public,
p340
aVwe can, too.
p341
aVAnd we need to start now.
p342
aVBecause like Marianne, we all want to bring every good thing to our children.
p343
aVAnd where is the controversy in that?
p344
aVThank you.
p345
aa(lp346
V(Applause)
p347
aa(lp348
VChris Anderson: Thank you.
p349
aVI have some questions for Melinda.
p350
aa(lp351
V(Applause ends)
p352
aa(lp353
VThank you for your courage and everything else.
p354
aa(lp355
VSo, Melinda, in the last few years
p356
aVI've heard a lot of smart people say something to the effect of,
p357
aV"We don't need to worry about the population issue anymore.
p358
aVFamily sizes are coming down naturally all over the world.
p359
aVWe're going to peak at nine or 10 billion. And that's it."
p360
aVAre they wrong?
p361
aa(lp362
VMelinda Gates: If you look at the statistics across Africa,
p363
aVthey are wrong.
p364
aVAnd I think we need to look at it, though, from a different lens.
p365
aVWe need to look at it from the ground upwards.
p366
aVI think that's one of the reasons we got ourselves in so much trouble
p367
aVon this issue of contraception.
p368
aVWe looked at it from top down
p369
aVand said we want to have different population numbers over time.
p370
aVYes, we care about the planet. Yes, we need to make the right choices.
p371
aVBut the choices have to be made at the family level.
p372
aVAnd it's only by giving people access and letting them choose what to do
p373
aVthat you get those sweeping changes that we have seen globally \u2014
p374
aVexcept for sub-Saharan Africa and those places in South Asia and Afghanistan.
p375
aa(lp376
VCA: Some people on the right in America
p377
aVand in many conservative cultures around the world
p378
aVmight say something like this:
p379
aV"It's all very well to talk about saving lives and empowering women and so on.
p380
aVBut, sex is sacred.
p381
aVWhat you're proposing is going to increase the likelihood
p382
aVthat lots of sex happens outside marriage.
p383
aVAnd that is wrong."
p384
aVWhat would you say to them?
p385
aa(lp386
VMG: I would say that sex is absolutely sacred.
p387
aVAnd it's sacred in Germany, and it's sacred in the United States,
p388
aVand it's sacred in France and so many places around the world.
p389
aVAnd the fact that 98 percent of women in my country who are sexually experienced
p390
aVsay they use birth control doesn't make sex any less sacred.
p391
aVIt just means that they're getting to make choices about their lives.
p392
aVAnd I think in that choice,
p393
aVwe're also honoring the sacredness of the family
p394
aVand the sacredness of the mother's life
p395
aVand the childrens' lives by saving their lives.
p396
aVTo me, that's incredibly sacred, too.
p397
aa(lp398
VCA: So what is your foundation doing to promote this issue?
p399
aVAnd what could people here and people listening on the web \u2014
p400
aVwhat would you like them to do?
p401
aa(lp402
VMG: I would say this \u2014 join the conversation.
p403
aVWe've listed the website up here. Join the conversation.
p404
aVTell your story about how contraception has either changed your life
p405
aVor somebody's life that you know.
p406
aVAnd say that you're for this.
p407
aVWe need a groundswell of people saying, "This makes sense.
p408
aVWe've got to give all women access \u2014 no matter where they live."
p409
aVAnd one of the things that we're going to do
p410
aVis do a large event July 11 in London,
p411
aVwith a whole host of countries, a whole host of African nations,
p412
aVto all say we're putting this back on the global health agenda.
p413
aVWe're going to commit resources to it,
p414
aVand we're going to do planning from the bottom up with governments
p415
aVto make sure that women are educated \u2014
p416
aVso that if they want the tool, they have it,
p417
aVand that they have lots of options available
p418
aVeither through their local healthcare worker
p419
aVor their local community rural clinic.
p420
aa(lp421
VCA: Melinda, I'm guessing that some of those nuns who taught you at school
p422
aVare going to see this TED Talk at some point.
p423
aVAre they going to be horrified, or are they cheering you on?
p424
aa(lp425
VMG: I know they're going to see the TED Talk
p426
aVbecause they know that I'm doing it and I plan to send it to them.
p427
aVAnd, you know, the nuns who taught me were incredibly progressive.
p428
aVI hope that they'll be very proud of me
p429
aVfor living out what they taught us about social justice and service.
p430
aVI have come to feel incredibly passionate about this issue
p431
aVbecause of what I've seen in the developing world.
p432
aVAnd for me, this topic has become very close to heart
p433
aVbecause you meet these women and they are so often voiceless.
p434
aVAnd yet they shouldn't be \u2014
p435
aVthey should have a voice, they should have access.
p436
aVAnd so I hope they'll feel
p437
aVthat I'm living out what I've learned from them
p438
aVand from the decades of work that I've already done at the foundation.
p439
aa(lp440
VCA: So, you and your team brought together today an amazing group of speakers
p441
aVto whom we're all grateful.
p442
aVDid you learn anything?
p443
aa(lp444
V(Laughter)
p445
aa(lp446
VMG: Oh my gosh, I learned so many things. I have so many follow-up questions.
p447
aVAnd I think a lot of this work is a journey.
p448
aVYou heard the discussion about the journey through energy,
p449
aVor the journey through social design,
p450
aVor the journey in the coming and saying,
p451
aV"Why aren't there any women on this platform?"
p452
aVAnd I think for all of us who work on these development issues,
p453
aVyou learn by talking to other people.
p454
aVYou learn by doing. You learn by trying and making mistakes.
p455
aVAnd it's the questions you ask.
p456
aVSometimes it's the questions you ask that helps lead to the answer
p457
aVthe next person that can help you answer it.
p458
aVSo I have lots of questions for the panelists from today.
p459
aVAnd I thought it was just an amazing day.
p460
aa(lp461
VCA: Melinda, thank you for inviting all of us on this journey with you.
p462
aa(lp463
VThank you so much. MG: Great. Thanks, Chris.

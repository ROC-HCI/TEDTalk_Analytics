VIn terms of invention,
p5
aVI'd like to tell you the tale of one of my favorite projects.
p6
aVI think it's one of the most exciting that I'm working on,
p7
aVbut I think it's also the simplest.
p8
aa(lp9
VIt's a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world.
p10
aVIt addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet,
p11
aVthe number one cause of death in children under five.
p12
aVWhich is ...?
p13
aVWater-borne diseases? Diarrhea? Malnutrition?
p14
aVNo.
p15
aVIt's breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires \u2014
p16
aVacute respiratory infections caused by this.
p17
aVCan you believe that?
p18
aa(lp19
VI find this shocking and somewhat appalling.
p20
aVCan't we make cleaner burning cooking fuels?
p21
aVCan't we make better stoves?
p22
aVHow is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year?
p23
aVI know Bill Joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes,
p24
aVso I'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes,
p25
aVwhich is charcoal.
p26
aa(lp27
V(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VSo this is a picture of rural Haiti.
p30
aVHaiti is now 98 percent deforested.
p31
aVYou'll see scenes like this all over the island.
p32
aVIt leads to all sorts of environmental problems
p33
aVand problems that affect people throughout the nation.
p34
aVA couple years ago there was severe flooding
p35
aVthat led to thousands of deaths \u2014
p36
aVthat's directly attributable to the fact
p37
aVthat there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil.
p38
aVSo the rains come \u2014
p39
aVthey go down the rivers and the flooding happens.
p40
aa(lp41
VNow one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this:
p42
aVpeople need to cook,
p43
aVand they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it.
p44
aVIt's not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage.
p45
aVThey know perfectly well, but they have no other choice.
p46
aVFossil fuels are not available,
p47
aVand solar energy doesn't cook the way that they like their food prepared.
p48
aVAnd so this is what they do.
p49
aVYou'll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree,
p50
aVcut it down and make charcoal out of it.
p51
aVSo not surprisingly,
p52
aVthere's a lot of effort that's been done to look at alternative cooking fuels.
p53
aa(lp54
VAbout four years ago, I took a team of students down to Haiti
p55
aVand we worked with Peace Corps volunteers there.
p56
aVThis is one such volunteer
p57
aVand this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked.
p58
aVAnd the idea was that you could take waste paper;
p59
aVyou could compress it
p60
aVand make briquettes that could be used for fuel.
p61
aVBut this device was very slow.
p62
aVSo our engineering students went to work on it
p63
aVand with some very simple changes,
p64
aVthey were able to triple the throughput of this device.
p65
aVSo you could imagine they were very excited about it.
p66
aVAnd they took the briquettes back to MIT so that they could test them.
p67
aVAnd one of the things that they found was they didn't burn.
p68
aVSo it was a little discouraging to the students.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd in fact, if you look closely,
p73
aVright here you can see it says, "US Peace Corps."
p74
aVAs it turns out, there actually wasn't any waste paper in this village.
p75
aVAnd while it was a good use of government paperwork
p76
aVfor this volunteer to bring it back with him to his village,
p77
aVit was 800 kilometers away.
p78
aVAnd so we thought perhaps there might be a better way
p79
aVto come up with an alternative cooking fuel.
p80
aa(lp81
VWhat we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel
p82
aVthat used something that was readily available on the local level.
p83
aVYou see these all over Haiti as well.
p84
aVThey're small-scale sugar mills.
p85
aVAnd the waste product from them
p86
aVafter you extract the juice from the sugarcane
p87
aVis called "bagasse."
p88
aVIt has no other use.
p89
aVIt has no nutritional value, so they don't feed it to the animals.
p90
aVIt just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it.
p91
aVWhat we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way
p92
aVto harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel
p93
aVthat would be something that people could easily cook with,
p94
aVsomething like charcoal.
p95
aVSo over the next couple of years,
p96
aVstudents and I worked to develop a process.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo you start with the bagasse, and then you take a very simple kiln
p99
aVthat you can make out of a waste fifty five-gallon oil drum.
p100
aVAfter some time, after setting it on fire,
p101
aVyou seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln,
p102
aVand then you end up with this carbonized material here.
p103
aVHowever, you can't burn this.
p104
aVIt's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking.
p105
aVSo we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes.
p106
aVAnd conveniently, one of my students was from Ghana,
p107
aVand he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called "kokonte,"
p108
aVwhich is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root.
p109
aVAnd so what we did was we looked,
p110
aVand we found that cassava is indeed grown in Haiti,
p111
aVunder the name of "manioc."
p112
aVIn fact, it's grown all over the world \u2014
p113
aVyucca, tapioca, manioc, cassava, it's all the same thing \u2014
p114
aVa very starchy root vegetable.
p115
aVAnd you can make a very thick, sticky porridge out of it,
p116
aVwhich you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes.
p117
aVSo we did this. We went down to Haiti.
p118
aVThese are the graduates of the first Ecole de Charbon,
p119
aVor Charcoal Institute.
p120
aVAnd these \u2014
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VThat's right. So I'm actually an instructor at MIT as well as CIT.
p125
aVAnd these are the briquettes that we made.
p126
aa(lp127
VNow I'm going to take you to a different continent.
p128
aVThis is India
p129
aVand this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in India.
p130
aVIt's cow dung.
p131
aVAnd more than in Haiti, this produces really smoky fires,
p132
aVand this is where you see the health impacts
p133
aVof cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel.
p134
aVKids and women are especially affected by it,
p135
aVbecause they're the ones who are around the cooking fires.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo we wanted to see
p138
aVif we could introduce this charcoal-making technology there.
p139
aVWell, unfortunately, they didn't have sugarcane
p140
aVand they didn't have cassava,
p141
aVbut that didn't stop us.
p142
aVWhat we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass.
p143
aVAnd there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area.
p144
aVAnd what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure,
p145
aVwhich they used ordinarily for their fuel.
p146
aVAnd we did side-by-side tests,
p147
aVand here you can see the charcoal briquettes
p148
aVand here the cow dung.
p149
aVAnd you can see that it's a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel.
p150
aVAnd in fact, it heats the water a lot more quickly.
p151
aVAnd so we were very happy, thus far.
p152
aVBut one of the things that we found
p153
aVwas when we did side-by-side comparisons with wood charcoal,
p154
aVit didn't burn as long.
p155
aVAnd the briquettes crumbled a little bit
p156
aVand we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking.
p157
aVSo we wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger briquette
p158
aVso that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in Haiti.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo we went back to MIT,
p161
aVwe took out the Instron machine
p162
aVand we figured out what sort of forces you needed
p163
aVin order to compress a briquette to the level
p164
aVthat you actually are getting improved performance out of it?
p165
aVAnd at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this,
p166
aVwe also had community partners in Haiti working to develop the process,
p167
aVto improve it and make it more accessible to people in the villages there.
p168
aVAnd after some time,
p169
aVwe developed a low-cost press that allows you to produce charcoal,
p170
aVwhich actually now burns not only \u2014
p171
aVactually, it burns longer, cleaner than wood charcoal.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo now we're in a situation where we have a product,
p174
aVwhich is actually better than what you can buy in Haiti in the marketplace,
p175
aVwhich is a very wonderful place to be.
p176
aVIn Haiti alone, about 30 million trees are cut down every year.
p177
aVThere's a possibility of this being implemented
p178
aVand saving a good portion of those.
p179
aVIn addition, the revenue generated from that charcoal is 260 million dollars.
p180
aVThat's an awful lot for a country like Haiti \u2014
p181
aVwith a population of eight million
p182
aVand an average income of less than 400 dollars.
p183
aVSo this is where we're also moving ahead with our charcoal project.
p184
aa(lp185
VAnd one of the things that I think is also interesting,
p186
aVis I have a friend up at UC Berkeley who's been doing risk analysis.
p187
aVAnd he's looked at the problem of the health impacts
p188
aVof burning wood versus charcoal.
p189
aVAnd he's found that worldwide, you could prevent a million deaths
p190
aVswitching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel.
p191
aVThat's remarkable,
p192
aVbut up until now, there weren't ways to do it without cutting down trees.
p193
aVBut now we have a way
p194
aVthat's using an agricultural waste material to create a cooking fuel.
p195
aa(lp196
VOne of the really exciting things, though,
p197
aVis something that came out of the trip that I took to Ghana just last month.
p198
aVAnd I think it's the coolest thing,
p199
aVand it's even lower tech than what you just saw,
p200
aVif you can imagine such a thing.
p201
aVHere it is.
p202
aVSo what is this?
p203
aVThis is corncobs turned into charcoal.
p204
aVAnd the beauty of this is that you don't need to form briquettes \u2014
p205
aVit comes ready made.
p206
aVThis is my $100 laptop, right here.
p207
aVAnd actually, like Nick, I brought samples.
p208
aa(lp209
V(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
VSo we can pass these around.
p212
aVThey're fully functional, field-tested, ready to roll out.
p213
aa(lp214
V(Laughter)
p215
aa(lp216
VAnd I think one of the things
p217
aVwhich is also remarkable about this technology,
p218
aVis that the technology transfer is so easy.
p219
aVCompared to the sugarcane charcoal,
p220
aVwhere we have to teach people how to form it into briquettes
p221
aVand you have the extra step of cooking the binder,
p222
aVthis comes pre-briquetted.
p223
aVAnd this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now,
p224
aVwhich is perhaps a sad commentary on my life.
p225
aa(lp226
V(Laughter)
p227
aa(lp228
VBut once you see it, like you guys in the front row \u2014
p229
aVAll right, yeah, OK.
p230
aVSo anyway \u2014
p231
aa(lp232
V(Laughter)
p233
aa(lp234
VHere it is.
p235
aVAnd this is, I think, a perfect example
p236
aVof what Robert Wright was talking about in those non-zero-sum things.
p237
aVSo not only do you have health benefits,
p238
aVyou have environmental benefits.
p239
aVBut this is one of the incredibly rare situations
p240
aVwhere you also have economic benefits.
p241
aVPeople can make their own cooking fuel from waste products.
p242
aVThey can generate income from this.
p243
aVThey can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal
p244
aVand they can produce excess and sell it in the market
p245
aVto people who aren't making their own.
p246
aVIt's really rare that you don't have trade-offs
p247
aVbetween health and economics, or environment and economics.
p248
aVSo this is a project that I just find extremely exciting
p249
aVand I'm really looking forward to see where it takes us.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo when we talk about, now, the future we will create,
p252
aVone of the things that I think is necessary
p253
aVis to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in.
p254
aVAnd now, I don't actually mean the world that we live in.
p255
aVI mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday
p256
aVgrinding grain for their families to eat.
p257
aVI mean the world where advanced building materials
p258
aVmeans cement roofing tiles that are made by hand,
p259
aVand where, when you work 10 hours a day,
p260
aVyou're still only earning 60 dollars in a month.
p261
aVI mean the world
p262
aVwhere women and children spend 40 billion hours a year fetching water.
p263
aVThat's as if the entire workforce of the state of California
p264
aVworked full time for a year doing nothing but fetching water.
p265
aa(lp266
VIt's a place where, for example, if this were India,
p267
aVin this room, only three of us would have a car.
p268
aVIf this were Afghanistan,
p269
aVonly one person in this room would know how the use the Internet.
p270
aVIf this were Zambia \u2014
p271
aV300 of you would be farmers,
p272
aV100 of you would have AIDS or HIV.
p273
aVAnd more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day.
p274
aVThese are the issues that we need to come up with solutions for.
p275
aVThese are the issues that we need to be training our engineers,
p276
aVour designers, our business people, our entrepreneurs to be facing.
p277
aVThese are the solutions that we need to find.
p278
aa(lp279
VI have a few areas that I believe are especially important that we address.
p280
aVOne of them is creating technologies
p281
aVto promote micro-finance and micro-enterprise,
p282
aVso that people who are living below the poverty line
p283
aVcan find a way to move out \u2014
p284
aVand that they're not doing it
p285
aVusing the same traditional basket making, poultry rearing, etc.
p286
aVBut there are new technologies and new products
p287
aVthat they can make on a small scale.
p288
aa(lp289
VThe next thing I believe
p290
aVis that we need to create technologies for poor farmers
p291
aVto add value to their own crops.
p292
aVAnd we need to rethink our development strategies,
p293
aVso that we're not promoting educational campaigns
p294
aVto get them to stop being farmers,
p295
aVbut rather to stop being poor farmers.
p296
aVAnd we need to think about how we can do that effectively.
p297
aVWe need to work with the people in these communities
p298
aVand give them the resources and the tools that they need
p299
aVto solve their own problems.
p300
aVThat's the best way to do it.
p301
aVWe shouldn't be doing it from outside.
p302
aVSo we need to create this future, and we need to start doing it now.
p303
aa(lp304
VThank you.
p305
aa(lp306
V(Applause)
p307
aa(lp308
VChris Anderson: Thank you, incredible.
p309
aVStay here.
p310
aVTell us \u2014 just while we see if someone has a question \u2014
p311
aVjust tell us about one of the other things that you've worked on.
p312
aa(lp313
VAmy Smith: Some of the other things we're working on
p314
aVare ways to do low-cost water quality testing,
p315
aVso that communities can maintain their own water systems,
p316
aVknow when they're working, know when they treat them, etc.
p317
aVWe're also looking at low-cost water-treatment systems.
p318
aVOne of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection
p319
aVand improving the ability to be able to do that.
p320
aa(lp321
VCA: What's the bottleneck preventing this stuff getting from scale?
p322
aVDo you need to find entrepreneurs, or venture capitalists,
p323
aVor what do you need to take what you've got and get it to scale?
p324
aa(lp325
VAS: I think it's large numbers of people moving it forward.
p326
aVIt's a difficult thing \u2014
p327
aVit's a marketplace which is very fragmented
p328
aVand a consumer population with no income.
p329
aVSo you can't use the same models that you use in the United States
p330
aVfor making things move forward.
p331
aVAnd we're a pretty small staff,
p332
aVwhich is me.
p333
aa(lp334
V(Laughter)
p335
aa(lp336
VSo, you know, I do what I can with the students.
p337
aVWe have 30 students a year go out into the field
p338
aVand try to implement this and move it forward.
p339
aVThe other thing is you have to do things with a long time frame,
p340
aVas, you know, you can't expect to get something done in a year or two years;
p341
aVyou have to be looking five or 10 years ahead.
p342
aVBut I think with the vision to do that, we can move forward.

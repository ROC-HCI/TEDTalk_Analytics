VI want to start my talk today with two observations
p5
aVabout the human species.
p6
aVThe first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious,
p7
aVand that's that our species, Homo sapiens,
p8
aVis actually really, really smart \u2014
p9
aVlike, ridiculously smart \u2014
p10
aVlike you're all doing things
p11
aVthat no other species on the planet does right now.
p12
aVAnd this is, of course,
p13
aVnot the first time you've probably recognized this.
p14
aVOf course, in addition to being smart, we're also an extremely vain species.
p15
aVSo we like pointing out the fact that we're smart.
p16
aVYou know, so I could turn to pretty much any sage
p17
aVfrom Shakespeare to Stephen Colbert
p18
aVto point out things like the fact that
p19
aVwe're noble in reason and infinite in faculties
p20
aVand just kind of awesome-er than anything else on the planet
p21
aVwhen it comes to all things cerebral.
p22
aa(lp23
VBut of course, there's a second observation about the human species
p24
aVthat I want to focus on a little bit more,
p25
aVand that's the fact that
p26
aVeven though we're actually really smart, sometimes uniquely smart,
p27
aVwe can also be incredibly, incredibly dumb
p28
aVwhen it comes to some aspects of our decision making.
p29
aVNow I'm seeing lots of smirks out there.
p30
aVDon't worry, I'm not going to call anyone in particular out
p31
aVon any aspects of your own mistakes.
p32
aVBut of course, just in the last two years
p33
aVwe see these unprecedented examples of human ineptitude.
p34
aVAnd we've watched as the tools we uniquely make
p35
aVto pull the resources out of our environment
p36
aVkind of just blow up in our face.
p37
aVWe've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create \u2014
p38
aVthese markets that were supposed to be foolproof \u2014
p39
aVwe've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes.
p40
aa(lp41
VBut both of these two embarrassing examples, I think,
p42
aVdon't highlight what I think is most embarrassing
p43
aVabout the mistakes that humans make,
p44
aVwhich is that we'd like to think that the mistakes we make
p45
aVare really just the result of a couple bad apples
p46
aVor a couple really sort of FAIL Blog-worthy decisions.
p47
aVBut it turns out, what social scientists are actually learning
p48
aVis that most of us, when put in certain contexts,
p49
aVwill actually make very specific mistakes.
p50
aVThe errors we make are actually predictable.
p51
aVWe make them again and again.
p52
aVAnd they're actually immune to lots of evidence.
p53
aVWhen we get negative feedback,
p54
aVwe still, the next time we're face with a certain context,
p55
aVtend to make the same errors.
p56
aVAnd so this has been a real puzzle to me
p57
aVas a sort of scholar of human nature.
p58
aVWhat I'm most curious about is,
p59
aVhow is a species that's as smart as we are
p60
aVcapable of such bad
p61
aVand such consistent errors all the time?
p62
aa(lp63
VYou know, we're the smartest thing out there, why can't we figure this out?
p64
aVIn some sense, where do our mistakes really come from?
p65
aVAnd having thought about this a little bit, I see a couple different possibilities.
p66
aVOne possibility is, in some sense, it's not really our fault.
p67
aVBecause we're a smart species,
p68
aVwe can actually create all kinds of environments
p69
aVthat are super, super complicated,
p70
aVsometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand,
p71
aVeven though we've actually created them.
p72
aVWe create financial markets that are super complex.
p73
aVWe create mortgage terms that we can't actually deal with.
p74
aVAnd of course, if we are put in environments where we can't deal with it,
p75
aVin some sense makes sense that we actually
p76
aVmight mess certain things up.
p77
aVIf this was the case, we'd have a really easy solution
p78
aVto the problem of human error.
p79
aVWe'd actually just say, okay, let's figure out
p80
aVthe kinds of technologies we can't deal with,
p81
aVthe kinds of environments that are bad \u2014
p82
aVget rid of those, design things better,
p83
aVand we should be the noble species
p84
aVthat we expect ourselves to be.
p85
aa(lp86
VBut there's another possibility that I find a little bit more worrying,
p87
aVwhich is, maybe it's not our environments that are messed up.
p88
aVMaybe it's actually us that's designed badly.
p89
aVThis is a hint that I've gotten
p90
aVfrom watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors.
p91
aVAnd what we see is that people tend to keep making errors
p92
aVexactly the same way, over and over again.
p93
aVIt feels like we might almost just be built
p94
aVto make errors in certain ways.
p95
aVThis is a possibility that I worry a little bit more about,
p96
aVbecause, if it's us that's messed up,
p97
aVit's not actually clear how we go about dealing with it.
p98
aVWe might just have to accept the fact that we're error prone
p99
aVand try to design things around it.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo this is the question my students and I wanted to get at.
p102
aVHow can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two?
p103
aVWhat we need is a population
p104
aVthat's basically smart, can make lots of decisions,
p105
aVbut doesn't have access to any of the systems we have,
p106
aVany of the things that might mess us up \u2014
p107
aVno human technology, human culture,
p108
aVmaybe even not human language.
p109
aVAnd so this is why we turned to these guys here.
p110
aVThese are one of the guys I work with. This is a brown capuchin monkey.
p111
aVThese guys are New World primates,
p112
aVwhich means they broke off from the human branch
p113
aVabout 35 million years ago.
p114
aVThis means that your great, great, great great, great, great \u2014
p115
aVwith about five million "greats" in there \u2014
p116
aVgrandmother was probably the same great, great, great, great
p117
aVgrandmother with five million "greats" in there
p118
aVas Holly up here.
p119
aVYou know, so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant,
p120
aVbut albeit evolutionary, relative.
p121
aVThe good news about Holly though is that
p122
aVshe doesn't actually have the same kinds of technologies we do.
p123
aVYou know, she's a smart, very cut creature, a primate as well,
p124
aVbut she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up.
p125
aVSo she's the perfect test case.
p126
aa(lp127
VWhat if we put Holly into the same context as humans?
p128
aVDoes she make the same mistakes as us?
p129
aVDoes she not learn from them? And so on.
p130
aVAnd so this is the kind of thing we decided to do.
p131
aVMy students and I got very excited about this a few years ago.
p132
aVWe said, all right, let's, you know, throw so problems at Holly,
p133
aVsee if she messes these things up.
p134
aVFirst problem is just, well, where should we start?
p135
aVBecause, you know, it's great for us, but bad for humans.
p136
aVWe make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts.
p137
aVYou know, where are we actually going to start with this?
p138
aVAnd because we started this work around the time of the financial collapse,
p139
aVaround the time when foreclosures were hitting the news,
p140
aVwe said, hhmm, maybe we should
p141
aVactually start in the financial domain.
p142
aVMaybe we should look at monkey's economic decisions
p143
aVand try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do.
p144
aa(lp145
VOf course, that's when we hit a sort second problem \u2014
p146
aVa little bit more methodological \u2014
p147
aVwhich is that, maybe you guys don't know,
p148
aVbut monkeys don't actually use money. I know, you haven't met them.
p149
aVBut this is why, you know, they're not in the queue behind you
p150
aVat the grocery store or the ATM \u2014 you know, they don't do this stuff.
p151
aVSo now we faced, you know, a little bit of a problem here.
p152
aVHow are we actually going to ask monkeys about money
p153
aVif they don't actually use it?
p154
aVSo we said, well, maybe we should just, actually just suck it up
p155
aVand teach monkeys how to use money.
p156
aVSo that's just what we did.
p157
aVWhat you're looking at over here is actually the first unit that I know of
p158
aVof non-human currency.
p159
aVWe weren't very creative at the time we started these studies,
p160
aVso we just called it a token.
p161
aVBut this is the unit of currency that we've taught our monkeys at Yale
p162
aVto actually use with humans,
p163
aVto actually buy different pieces of food.
p164
aVIt doesn't look like much \u2014 in fact, it isn't like much.
p165
aa(lp166
VLike most of our money, it's just a piece of metal.
p167
aVAs those of you who've taken currencies home from your trip know,
p168
aVonce you get home, it's actually pretty useless.
p169
aVIt was useless to the monkeys at first
p170
aVbefore they realized what they could do with it.
p171
aVWhen we first gave it to them in their enclosures,
p172
aVthey actually kind of picked them up, looked at them.
p173
aVThey were these kind of weird things.
p174
aVBut very quickly, the monkeys realized
p175
aVthat they could actually hand these tokens over
p176
aVto different humans in the lab for some food.
p177
aVAnd so you see one of our monkeys, Mayday, up here doing this.
p178
aVThis is A and B are kind of the points where she's sort of a little bit
p179
aVcurious about these things \u2014 doesn't know.
p180
aVThere's this waiting hand from a human experimenter,
p181
aVand Mayday quickly figures out, apparently the human wants this.
p182
aVHands it over, and then gets some food.
p183
aVIt turns out not just Mayday, all of our monkeys get good
p184
aVat trading tokens with human salesman.
p185
aVSo here's just a quick video of what this looks like.
p186
aVHere's Mayday. She's going to be trading a token for some food
p187
aVand waiting happily and getting her food.
p188
aVHere's Felix, I think. He's our alpha male; he's a kind of big guy.
p189
aVBut he too waits patiently, gets his food and goes on.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo the monkeys get really good at this.
p192
aVThey're surprisingly good at this with very little training.
p193
aVWe just allowed them to pick this up on their own.
p194
aVThe question is: is this anything like human money?
p195
aVIs this a market at all,
p196
aVor did we just do a weird psychologist's trick
p197
aVby getting monkeys to do something,
p198
aVlooking smart, but not really being smart.
p199
aVAnd so we said, well, what would the monkeys spontaneously do
p200
aVif this was really their currency, if they were really using it like money?
p201
aVWell, you might actually imagine them
p202
aVto do all the kinds of smart things
p203
aVthat humans do when they start exchanging money with each other.
p204
aVYou might have them start paying attention to price,
p205
aVpaying attention to how much they buy \u2014
p206
aVsort of keeping track of their monkey token, as it were.
p207
aVDo the monkeys do anything like this?
p208
aa(lp209
VAnd so our monkey marketplace was born.
p210
aVThe way this works is that
p211
aVour monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social enclosure.
p212
aVWhen they get a hankering for some treats,
p213
aVwe actually allowed them a way out
p214
aVinto a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market.
p215
aVUpon entering the market \u2014
p216
aVit was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets
p217
aVbecause, as the monkeys entered the door of the market,
p218
aVa human would give them a big wallet full of tokens
p219
aVso they could actually trade the tokens
p220
aVwith one of these two guys here \u2014
p221
aVtwo different possible human salesmen
p222
aVthat they could actually buy stuff from.
p223
aVThe salesmen were students from my lab.
p224
aVThey dressed differently; they were different people.
p225
aVAnd over time, they did basically the same thing
p226
aVso the monkeys could learn, you know,
p227
aVwho sold what at what price \u2014 you know, who was reliable, who wasn't, and so on.
p228
aVAnd you can see that each of the experimenters
p229
aVis actually holding up a little, yellow food dish.
p230
aVand that's what the monkey can for a single token.
p231
aVSo everything costs one token,
p232
aVbut as you can see, sometimes tokens buy more than others,
p233
aVsometimes more grapes than others.
p234
aa(lp235
VSo I'll show you a quick video of what this marketplace actually looks like.
p236
aVHere's a monkey-eye-view. Monkeys are shorter, so it's a little short.
p237
aVBut here's Honey.
p238
aVShe's waiting for the market to open a little impatiently.
p239
aVAll of a sudden the market opens. Here's her choice: one grapes or two grapes.
p240
aVYou can see Honey, very good market economist,
p241
aVgoes with the guy who gives more.
p242
aVShe could teach our financial advisers a few things or two.
p243
aVSo not just Honey,
p244
aVmost of the monkeys went with guys who had more.
p245
aVMost of the monkeys went with guys who had better food.
p246
aVWhen we introduced sales, we saw the monkeys paid attention to that.
p247
aVThey really cared about their monkey token dollar.
p248
aVThe more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists
p249
aVto actually look at the monkeys' data using economic tools,
p250
aVthey basically matched, not just qualitatively,
p251
aVbut quantitatively with what we saw
p252
aVhumans doing in a real market.
p253
aVSo much so that, if you saw the monkeys' numbers,
p254
aVyou couldn't tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market.
p255
aa(lp256
VAnd what we'd really thought we'd done
p257
aVis like we'd actually introduced something
p258
aVthat, at least for the monkeys and us,
p259
aVworks like a real financial currency.
p260
aVQuestion is: do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do?
p261
aVWell, we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might.
p262
aVOne thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace
p263
aVwas any evidence of saving \u2014
p264
aVyou know, just like our own species.
p265
aVThe monkeys entered the market, spent their entire budget
p266
aVand then went back to everyone else.
p267
aVThe other thing we also spontaneously saw,
p268
aVembarrassingly enough,
p269
aVis spontaneous evidence of larceny.
p270
aVThe monkeys would rip-off the tokens at every available opportunity \u2014
p271
aVfrom each other, often from us \u2014
p272
aVyou know, things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing,
p273
aVbut things we spontaneously saw.
p274
aa(lp275
VSo we said, this looks bad.
p276
aVCan we actually see if the monkeys
p277
aVare doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do?
p278
aVOne possibility is just kind of let
p279
aVthe monkey financial system play out,
p280
aVyou know, see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years.
p281
aVWe were a little impatient so we wanted
p282
aVto sort of speed things up a bit.
p283
aVSo we said, let's actually give the monkeys
p284
aVthe same kinds of problems
p285
aVthat humans tend to get wrong
p286
aVin certain kinds of economic challenges,
p287
aVor certain kinds of economic experiments.
p288
aVAnd so, since the best way to see how people go wrong
p289
aVis to actually do it yourself,
p290
aVI'm going to give you guys a quick experiment
p291
aVto sort of watch your own financial intuitions in action.
p292
aa(lp293
VSo imagine that right now
p294
aVI handed each and every one of you
p295
aVa thousand U.S. dollars \u2014 so 10 crisp hundred dollar bills.
p296
aVTake these, put it in your wallet
p297
aVand spend a second thinking about what you're going to do with it.
p298
aVBecause it's yours now; you can buy whatever you want.
p299
aVDonate it, take it, and so on.
p300
aVSounds great, but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money.
p301
aVAnd here's your choice: you can either be risky,
p302
aVin which case I'm going to flip one of these monkey tokens.
p303
aVIf it comes up heads, you're going to get a thousand dollars more.
p304
aVIf it comes up tails, you get nothing.
p305
aVSo it's a chance to get more, but it's pretty risky.
p306
aVYour other option is a bit safe. Your just going to get some money for sure.
p307
aVI'm just going to give you 500 bucks.
p308
aVYou can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately.
p309
aVSo see what your intuition is here.
p310
aVMost people actually go with the play-it-safe option.
p311
aVMost people say, why should I be risky when I can get 1,500 dollars for sure?
p312
aVThis seems like a good bet. I'm going to go with that.
p313
aVYou might say, eh, that's not really irrational.
p314
aVPeople are a little risk-averse. So what?
p315
aa(lp316
VWell, the "so what?" comes when start thinking
p317
aVabout the same problem
p318
aVset up just a little bit differently.
p319
aVSo now imagine that I give each and every one of you
p320
aV2,000 dollars \u2014 20 crisp hundred dollar bills.
p321
aVNow you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before.
p322
aVThink about how you'd feel sticking it in your wallet.
p323
aVAnd now imagine that I have you make another choice
p324
aVBut this time, it's a little bit worse.
p325
aVNow, you're going to be deciding how you're going to lose money,
p326
aVbut you're going to get the same choice.
p327
aVYou can either take a risky loss \u2014
p328
aVso I'll flip a coin. If it comes up heads, you're going to actually lose a lot.
p329
aVIf it comes up tails, you lose nothing, you're fine, get to keep the whole thing \u2014
p330
aVor you could play it safe, which means you have to reach back into your wallet
p331
aVand give me five of those $100 bills, for certain.
p332
aa(lp333
VAnd I'm seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there.
p334
aVSo maybe you're having the same intuitions
p335
aVas the subjects that were actually tested in this,
p336
aVwhich is when presented with these options,
p337
aVpeople don't choose to play it safe.
p338
aVThey actually tend to go a little risky.
p339
aVThe reason this is irrational is that we've given people in both situations
p340
aVthe same choice.
p341
aVIt's a 50/50 shot of a thousand or 2,000,
p342
aVor just 1,500 dollars with certainty.
p343
aVBut people's intuitions about how much risk to take
p344
aVvaries depending on where they started with.
p345
aa(lp346
VSo what's going on?
p347
aVWell, it turns out that this seems to be the result
p348
aVof at least two biases that we have at the psychological level.
p349
aVOne is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms.
p350
aVYou really have to do work to figure out,
p351
aVwell, one option's a thousand, 2,000;
p352
aVone is 1,500.
p353
aVInstead, we find it very easy to think in very relative terms
p354
aVas options change from one time to another.
p355
aVSo we think of things as, "Oh, I'm going to get more," or "Oh, I'm going to get less."
p356
aVThis is all well and good, except that
p357
aVchanges in different directions
p358
aVactually effect whether or not we think
p359
aVoptions are good or not.
p360
aVAnd this leads to the second bias,
p361
aVwhich economists have called loss aversion.
p362
aa(lp363
VThe idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red.
p364
aVWe really hate it when we have to lose out on some money.
p365
aVAnd this means that sometimes we'll actually
p366
aVswitch our preferences to avoid this.
p367
aVWhat you saw in that last scenario is that
p368
aVsubjects get risky
p369
aVbecause they want the small shot that there won't be any loss.
p370
aVThat means when we're in a risk mindset \u2014
p371
aVexcuse me, when we're in a loss mindset,
p372
aVwe actually become more risky,
p373
aVwhich can actually be really worrying.
p374
aVThese kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans.
p375
aVThey're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer \u2014
p376
aVbecause they're evaluating them in relative terms.
p377
aVThey're why people in the housing market refused to sell their house \u2014
p378
aVbecause they don't want to sell at a loss.
p379
aa(lp380
VThe question we were interested in
p381
aVis whether the monkeys show the same biases.
p382
aVIf we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market,
p383
aVwould they do the same thing as people?
p384
aVAnd so this is what we did, we gave the monkeys choices
p385
aVbetween guys who were safe \u2014 they did the same thing every time \u2014
p386
aVor guys who were risky \u2014
p387
aVthey did things differently half the time.
p388
aVAnd then we gave them options that were bonuses \u2014
p389
aVlike you guys did in the first scenario \u2014
p390
aVso they actually have a chance more,
p391
aVor pieces where they were experiencing losses \u2014
p392
aVthey actually thought they were going to get more than they really got.
p393
aa(lp394
VAnd so this is what this looks like.
p395
aVWe introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen.
p396
aVThe guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape,
p397
aVso it looks pretty good.
p398
aVBut they're going to give the monkeys bonuses.
p399
aVThe guy on the left is a safe bonus.
p400
aVAll the time, he adds one, to give the monkeys two.
p401
aVThe guy on the right is actually a risky bonus.
p402
aVSometimes the monkeys get no bonus \u2014 so this is a bonus of zero.
p403
aVSometimes the monkeys get two extra.
p404
aVFor a big bonus, now they get three.
p405
aVBut this is the same choice you guys just faced.
p406
aVDo the monkeys actually want to play it safe
p407
aVand then go with the guy who's going to do the same thing on every trial,
p408
aVor do they want to be risky
p409
aVand try to get a risky, but big, bonus,
p410
aVbut risk the possibility of getting no bonus.
p411
aVPeople here played it safe.
p412
aVTurns out, the monkeys play it safe too.
p413
aVQualitatively and quantitatively,
p414
aVthey choose exactly the same way as people,
p415
aVwhen tested in the same thing.
p416
aa(lp417
VYou might say, well, maybe the monkeys just don't like risk.
p418
aVMaybe we should see how they do with losses.
p419
aVAnd so we ran a second version of this.
p420
aVNow, the monkeys meet two guys
p421
aVwho aren't giving them bonuses;
p422
aVthey're actually giving them less than they expect.
p423
aVSo they look like they're starting out with a big amount.
p424
aVThese are three grapes; the monkey's really psyched for this.
p425
aVBut now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect.
p426
aVThey guy on the left is a safe loss.
p427
aVEvery single time, he's going to take one of these away
p428
aVand give the monkeys just two.
p429
aVthe guy on the right is the risky loss.
p430
aVSometimes he gives no loss, so the monkeys are really psyched,
p431
aVbut sometimes he actually gives a big loss,
p432
aVtaking away two to give the monkeys only one.
p433
aa(lp434
VAnd so what do the monkeys do?
p435
aVAgain, same choice; they can play it safe
p436
aVfor always getting two grapes every single time,
p437
aVor they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three.
p438
aVThe remarkable thing to us is that, when you give monkeys this choice,
p439
aVthey do the same irrational thing that people do.
p440
aVThey actually become more risky
p441
aVdepending on how the experimenters started.
p442
aVThis is crazy because it suggests that the monkeys too
p443
aVare evaluating things in relative terms
p444
aVand actually treating losses differently than they treat gains.
p445
aa(lp446
VSo what does all of this mean?
p447
aVWell, what we've shown is that, first of all,
p448
aVwe can actually give the monkeys a financial currency,
p449
aVand they do very similar things with it.
p450
aVThey do some of the smart things we do,
p451
aVsome of the kind of not so nice things we do,
p452
aVlike steal it and so on.
p453
aVBut they also do some of the irrational things we do.
p454
aVThey systematically get things wrong
p455
aVand in the same ways that we do.
p456
aVThis is the first take-home message of the Talk,
p457
aVwhich is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought,
p458
aVoh, I'm totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser.
p459
aVThey're way cuter than the one at ... you know \u2014
p460
aVDon't do that; they're probably going to be just as dumb
p461
aVas the human one you already have.
p462
aVSo, you know, a little bad \u2014 Sorry, sorry, sorry.
p463
aVA little bad for monkey investors.
p464
aa(lp465
VBut of course, you know, the reason you're laughing is bad for humans too.
p466
aVBecause we've answered the question we started out with.
p467
aVWe wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from.
p468
aVAnd we started with the hope that maybe we can
p469
aVsort of tweak our financial institutions,
p470
aVtweak our technologies to make ourselves better.
p471
aVBut what we've learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that.
p472
aVIn fact, they might be due to the very nature
p473
aVof our evolutionary history.
p474
aVYou know, maybe it's not just humans
p475
aVat the right side of this chain that's duncey.
p476
aVMaybe it's sort of duncey all the way back.
p477
aVAnd this, if we believe the capuchin monkey results,
p478
aVmeans that these duncey strategies
p479
aVmight be 35 million years old.
p480
aVThat's a long time for a strategy
p481
aVto potentially get changed around \u2014 really, really old.
p482
aa(lp483
VWhat do we know about other old strategies like this?
p484
aVWell, one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome.
p485
aVYou know, think of our evolutionary predilection
p486
aVfor eating sweet things, fatty things like cheesecake.
p487
aVYou can't just shut that off.
p488
aVYou can't just look at the dessert cart as say, "No, no, no. That looks disgusting to me."
p489
aVWe're just built differently.
p490
aVWe're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after.
p491
aVMy guess is that the same thing is going to be true
p492
aVwhen humans are perceiving
p493
aVdifferent financial decisions.
p494
aVWhen you're watching your stocks plummet into the red,
p495
aVwhen you're watching your house price go down,
p496
aVyou're not going to be able to see that
p497
aVin anything but old evolutionary terms.
p498
aVThis means that the biases
p499
aVthat lead investors to do badly,
p500
aVthat lead to the foreclosure crisis
p501
aVare going to be really hard to overcome.
p502
aa(lp503
VSo that's the bad news. The question is: is there any good news?
p504
aVI'm supposed to be up here telling you the good news.
p505
aVWell, the good news, I think,
p506
aVis what I started with at the beginning of the Talk,
p507
aVwhich is that humans are not only smart;
p508
aVwe're really inspirationally smart
p509
aVto the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom.
p510
aVWe're so good at overcoming our biological limitations \u2014
p511
aVyou know, I flew over here in an airplane.
p512
aVI didn't have to try to flap my wings.
p513
aVI'm wearing contact lenses now so that I can see all of you.
p514
aVI don't have to rely on my own near-sightedness.
p515
aVWe actually have all of these cases
p516
aVwhere we overcome our biological limitations
p517
aVthrough technology and other means, seemingly pretty easily.
p518
aVBut we have to recognize that we have those limitations.
p519
aa(lp520
VAnd here's the rub.
p521
aVIt was Camus who once said that, "Man is the only species
p522
aVwho refuses to be what he really is."
p523
aVBut the irony is that
p524
aVit might only be in recognizing our limitations
p525
aVthat we can really actually overcome them.
p526
aVThe hope is that you all will think about your limitations,
p527
aVnot necessarily as unovercomable,
p528
aVbut to recognize them, accept them
p529
aVand then use the world of design to actually figure them out.
p530
aVThat might be the only way that we will really be able
p531
aVto achieve our own human potential
p532
aVand really be the noble species we hope to all be.
p533
aa(lp534
VThank you.

The twist: Santos looks not only for positive humanlike traits, like tool-using and altruism, but irrational ones, like biased decisionmaking.</p><p>In elegant, carefully constructed experiments, Santos and CapLab have studied <strong>how primates understand and categorize objects in the physical world</strong> -- for instance, that monkeys understand an object is still whole even when part of it is obscured. Going deeper, their experiments also search for clues that primates possess a theory of mind -- an ability to think about what other people think. </p><p>Most recently, the lab has been looking at behaviors that were once the province mainly of novelists: jealousy, frustration, judgment of others&#39; intentions, poor economic choices. In one experiment, Santos and her team <strong>taught monkeys to use a form of money</strong>, tradeable for food. When certain foods became cheaper, monkeys would, like humans, overbuy.

VMark Zuckerberg,
p5
aVa journalist was asking him a question about the news feed.
p6
aVAnd the journalist was asking him,
p7
aV"Why is this so important?"
p8
aVAnd Zuckerberg said,
p9
aV"A squirrel dying in your front yard
p10
aVmay be more relevant to your interests right now
p11
aVthan people dying in Africa."
p12
aVAnd I want to talk about
p13
aVwhat a Web based on that idea of relevance might look like.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo when I was growing up
p16
aVin a really rural area in Maine,
p17
aVthe Internet meant something very different to me.
p18
aVIt meant a connection to the world.
p19
aVIt meant something that would connect us all together.
p20
aVAnd I was sure that it was going to be great for democracy
p21
aVand for our society.
p22
aVBut there's this shift
p23
aVin how information is flowing online,
p24
aVand it's invisible.
p25
aVAnd if we don't pay attention to it,
p26
aVit could be a real problem.
p27
aVSo I first noticed this in a place I spend a lot of time \u2014
p28
aVmy Facebook page.
p29
aVI'm progressive, politically \u2014 big surprise \u2014
p30
aVbut I've always gone out of my way to meet conservatives.
p31
aVI like hearing what they're thinking about;
p32
aVI like seeing what they link to;
p33
aVI like learning a thing or two.
p34
aVAnd so I was surprised when I noticed one day
p35
aVthat the conservatives had disappeared from my Facebook feed.
p36
aVAnd what it turned out was going on
p37
aVwas that Facebook was looking at which links I clicked on,
p38
aVand it was noticing that, actually,
p39
aVI was clicking more on my liberal friends' links
p40
aVthan on my conservative friends' links.
p41
aVAnd without consulting me about it,
p42
aVit had edited them out.
p43
aVThey disappeared.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo Facebook isn't the only place
p46
aVthat's doing this kind of invisible, algorithmic
p47
aVediting of the Web.
p48
aVGoogle's doing it too.
p49
aVIf I search for something, and you search for something,
p50
aVeven right now at the very same time,
p51
aVwe may get very different search results.
p52
aVEven if you're logged out, one engineer told me,
p53
aVthere are 57 signals
p54
aVthat Google looks at \u2014
p55
aVeverything from what kind of computer you're on
p56
aVto what kind of browser you're using
p57
aVto where you're located \u2014
p58
aVthat it uses to personally tailor your query results.
p59
aVThink about it for a second:
p60
aVthere is no standard Google anymore.
p61
aVAnd you know, the funny thing about this is that it's hard to see.
p62
aVYou can't see how different your search results are
p63
aVfrom anyone else's.
p64
aa(lp65
VBut a couple of weeks ago,
p66
aVI asked a bunch of friends to Google "Egypt"
p67
aVand to send me screen shots of what they got.
p68
aVSo here's my friend Scott's screen shot.
p69
aVAnd here's my friend Daniel's screen shot.
p70
aVWhen you put them side-by-side,
p71
aVyou don't even have to read the links
p72
aVto see how different these two pages are.
p73
aVBut when you do read the links,
p74
aVit's really quite remarkable.
p75
aVDaniel didn't get anything about the protests in Egypt at all
p76
aVin his first page of Google results.
p77
aVScott's results were full of them.
p78
aVAnd this was the big story of the day at that time.
p79
aVThat's how different these results are becoming.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo it's not just Google and Facebook either.
p82
aVThis is something that's sweeping the Web.
p83
aVThere are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personalization.
p84
aVYahoo News, the biggest news site on the Internet,
p85
aVis now personalized \u2014 different people get different things.
p86
aVHuffington Post, the Washington Post, the New York Times \u2014
p87
aVall flirting with personalization in various ways.
p88
aVAnd this moves us very quickly
p89
aVtoward a world in which
p90
aVthe Internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see,
p91
aVbut not necessarily what we need to see.
p92
aVAs Eric Schmidt said,
p93
aV"It will be very hard for people to watch or consume something
p94
aVthat has not in some sense
p95
aVbeen tailored for them."
p96
aa(lp97
VSo I do think this is a problem.
p98
aVAnd I think, if you take all of these filters together,
p99
aVyou take all these algorithms,
p100
aVyou get what I call a filter bubble.
p101
aVAnd your filter bubble is your own personal,
p102
aVunique universe of information
p103
aVthat you live in online.
p104
aVAnd what's in your filter bubble
p105
aVdepends on who you are, and it depends on what you do.
p106
aVBut the thing is that you don't decide what gets in.
p107
aVAnd more importantly,
p108
aVyou don't actually see what gets edited out.
p109
aVSo one of the problems with the filter bubble
p110
aVwas discovered by some researchers at Netflix.
p111
aVAnd they were looking at the Netflix queues, and they noticed something kind of funny
p112
aVthat a lot of us probably have noticed,
p113
aVwhich is there are some movies
p114
aVthat just sort of zip right up and out to our houses.
p115
aVThey enter the queue, they just zip right out.
p116
aVSo "Iron Man" zips right out,
p117
aVand "Waiting for Superman"
p118
aVcan wait for a really long time.
p119
aa(lp120
VWhat they discovered
p121
aVwas that in our Netflix queues
p122
aVthere's this epic struggle going on
p123
aVbetween our future aspirational selves
p124
aVand our more impulsive present selves.
p125
aVYou know we all want to be someone
p126
aVwho has watched "Rashomon,"
p127
aVbut right now
p128
aVwe want to watch "Ace Ventura" for the fourth time.
p129
aV(Laughter)
p130
aVSo the best editing gives us a bit of both.
p131
aVIt gives us a little bit of Justin Bieber
p132
aVand a little bit of Afghanistan.
p133
aVIt gives us some information vegetables;
p134
aVit gives us some information dessert.
p135
aVAnd the challenge with these kinds of algorithmic filters,
p136
aVthese personalized filters,
p137
aVis that, because they're mainly looking
p138
aVat what you click on first,
p139
aVit can throw off that balance.
p140
aVAnd instead of a balanced information diet,
p141
aVyou can end up surrounded
p142
aVby information junk food.
p143
aa(lp144
VWhat this suggests
p145
aVis actually that we may have the story about the Internet wrong.
p146
aVIn a broadcast society \u2014
p147
aVthis is how the founding mythology goes \u2014
p148
aVin a broadcast society,
p149
aVthere were these gatekeepers, the editors,
p150
aVand they controlled the flows of information.
p151
aVAnd along came the Internet and it swept them out of the way,
p152
aVand it allowed all of us to connect together,
p153
aVand it was awesome.
p154
aVBut that's not actually what's happening right now.
p155
aVWhat we're seeing is more of a passing of the torch
p156
aVfrom human gatekeepers
p157
aVto algorithmic ones.
p158
aVAnd the thing is that the algorithms
p159
aVdon't yet have the kind of embedded ethics
p160
aVthat the editors did.
p161
aVSo if algorithms are going to curate the world for us,
p162
aVif they're going to decide what we get to see and what we don't get to see,
p163
aVthen we need to make sure
p164
aVthat they're not just keyed to relevance.
p165
aVWe need to make sure that they also show us things
p166
aVthat are uncomfortable or challenging or important \u2014
p167
aVthis is what TED does \u2014
p168
aVother points of view.
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd the thing is, we've actually been here before
p171
aVas a society.
p172
aVIn 1915, it's not like newspapers were sweating a lot
p173
aVabout their civic responsibilities.
p174
aVThen people noticed
p175
aVthat they were doing something really important.
p176
aVThat, in fact, you couldn't have
p177
aVa functioning democracy
p178
aVif citizens didn't get a good flow of information,
p179
aVthat the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter,
p180
aVand then journalistic ethics developed.
p181
aVIt wasn't perfect,
p182
aVbut it got us through the last century.
p183
aVAnd so now,
p184
aVwe're kind of back in 1915 on the Web.
p185
aVAnd we need the new gatekeepers
p186
aVto encode that kind of responsibility
p187
aVinto the code that they're writing.
p188
aa(lp189
VI know that there are a lot of people here from Facebook and from Google \u2014
p190
aVLarry and Sergey \u2014
p191
aVpeople who have helped build the Web as it is,
p192
aVand I'm grateful for that.
p193
aVBut we really need you to make sure
p194
aVthat these algorithms have encoded in them
p195
aVa sense of the public life, a sense of civic responsibility.
p196
aVWe need you to make sure that they're transparent enough
p197
aVthat we can see what the rules are
p198
aVthat determine what gets through our filters.
p199
aVAnd we need you to give us some control
p200
aVso that we can decide
p201
aVwhat gets through and what doesn't.
p202
aVBecause I think
p203
aVwe really need the Internet to be that thing
p204
aVthat we all dreamed of it being.
p205
aVWe need it to connect us all together.
p206
aVWe need it to introduce us to new ideas
p207
aVand new people and different perspectives.
p208
aVAnd it's not going to do that
p209
aVif it leaves us all isolated in a Web of one.
p210
aa(lp211

In the following weeks, over half a million people from 192 countries signed on, and Pariser rather unexpectedly became an online organizer. The website merged with <a href=\\"http://front.moveon.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">MoveOn.org</a>  in November 2001, and Pariser -- then 20 years old -- joined the group to direct its foreign policy campaigns. He led what the <em>New York Times Magazine</em> called the &quot;mainstream arm of the peace movement&quot; -- tripling MoveOn&#39;s member base and demonstrating how large numbers of small donations could be mobilized through online engagement.<br /><br />In 2004, Pariser became executive director of MoveOn. Under his leadership, MoveOn.org Political Action has grown to 5 million members and raised over $120 million from millions of small donors to support advocacy campaigns and political candidates. Pariser focused MoveOn on online-to-offline organizing, developing phone-banking tools and precinct programs in 2004 and 2006 that laid the groundwork for Barack Obama&#39;s extraordinary web-powered campaign. In 2008, Pariser transitioned the Executive Director role at MoveOn to Justin Ruben and became President of MoveOn&rsquo;s board; he&#39;s now a senior fellow at the <a href=\\"http://www.rooseveltinstitute.org/people/fellows/eli-pariser\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Roosevelt Institute</a>.<br /><br />His book <a href=\\"http://geni.us/filterbubble\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>The Filter Bubble</em></a>  is set for release May 12, 2011.

September 11, 2001, attacks, Eli Pariser created a website calling for a multilateral approach to fighting terrorism. In the following weeks, over half a million people from 192 countries signed on, and Pariser rather unexpectedly became an online organizer. The website merged with <a href=\\"http://front.moveon.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">MoveOn.org</a>  in November 2001, and Pariser -- then 20 years old -- joined the group to direct its foreign policy campaigns. He led what the <em>New York Times Magazine</em> called the &quot;mainstream arm of the peace movement&quot; -- tripling MoveOn&#39;s member base and demonstrating how large numbers of small donations could be mobilized through online engagement.<br /><br />In 2004, Pariser became executive director of MoveOn. Under his leadership, MoveOn.org Political Action has grown to 5 million members and raised over $120 million from millions of small donors to support advocacy campaigns and political candidates. Pariser focused MoveOn on online-to-offline organizing, developing phone-banking tools and precinct programs in 2004 and 2006 that laid the groundwork for Barack Obama&#39;s extraordinary web-powered campaign. In 2008, Pariser transitioned the Executive Director role at MoveOn to Justin Ruben and became President of MoveOn&rsquo;s board; he&#39;s now a senior fellow at the <a href=\\"http://www.rooseveltinstitute.org/people/fellows/eli-pariser\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Roosevelt Institute</a>.<br /><br />His book <a href=\\"http://geni.us/filterbubble\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>The Filter Bubble</em></a>  is set for release May 12, 2011.

VI consider it my life's mission
p5
aVto convey the urgency of climate change through my work.
p6
aVI've traveled north to the Arctic to the capture the unfolding story
p7
aVof polar melt,
p8
aVand south to the Equator to document the subsequent rising seas.
p9
aVMost recently, I visited the icy coast of Greenland
p10
aVand the low-lying islands of the Maldives,
p11
aVconnecting two seemingly disparate but equally endangered
p12
aVparts of our planet.
p13
aa(lp14
VMy drawings explore moments of transition, turbulence
p15
aVand tranquility in the landscape,
p16
aVallowing viewers to emotionally connect
p17
aVwith a place you might never have the chance to visit.
p18
aVI choose to convey the beauty as opposed to the devastation.
p19
aVIf you can experience the sublimity of these landscapes,
p20
aVperhaps you'll be inspired to protect and preserve them.
p21
aa(lp22
VBehavioral psychology tells us that we take action
p23
aVand make decisions based on our emotions above all else.
p24
aVAnd studies have shown that art impacts our emotions
p25
aVmore effectively than a scary news report.
p26
aVExperts predict ice-free Arctic summers
p27
aVas early as 2020.
p28
aVAnd sea levels are likely to rise between two and ten feet
p29
aVby century's end.
p30
aVI have dedicated my career to illuminating these projections
p31
aVwith an accessible medium,
p32
aVone that moves us in a way that statistics may not.
p33
aa(lp34
VMy process begins with traveling to the places
p35
aVat the forefront of climate change.
p36
aVOn-site, I take thousands of photographs.
p37
aVBack in the studio,
p38
aVI work from both my memory of the experience and the photographs
p39
aVto create very large-scale compositions,
p40
aVsometimes over 10 feet wide.
p41
aa(lp42
VI draw with soft pastel, which is dry like charcoal, but colors.
p43
aVI consider my work drawings but others call them painting.
p44
aVI cringe, though, when I'm referred to as a "finger painter."
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VBut I don't use any tools
p49
aVand I have always used my fingers and palms
p50
aVto manipulate the pigment on the paper.
p51
aVDrawing is a form of meditation for me.
p52
aVIt quiets my mind.
p53
aVI don't perceive what I'm drawing
p54
aVas ice or water.
p55
aVInstead, the image is stripped down
p56
aVto its most basic form of color and shape.
p57
aVOnce the piece is complete,
p58
aVI can finally experience the composition as a whole,
p59
aVas an iceberg floating through glassy water,
p60
aVor a wave cresting with foam.
p61
aVOn average, a piece this size takes me about,
p62
aVas you can see, 10 seconds.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
V(Applause)
p67
aa(lp68
VReally, more like 200 hours, 250 hours for something that size.
p69
aVBut I've been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon, really.
p70
aVMy mom was an artist, and growing up,
p71
aVwe always had art supplies all over the house.
p72
aVMy mother's love of photography
p73
aVpropelled her to the most remote regions of the earth,
p74
aVand my family and I were fortunate enough
p75
aVto join and support her on these adventures.
p76
aVWe rode camels in Northern Africa
p77
aVand mushed on dog sleds near the North Pole.
p78
aa(lp79
VIn August of 2012, I led my first expedition,
p80
aVtaking a group of artists and scholars up the northwest coast of Greenland.
p81
aVMy mother was originally supposed to lead this trip.
p82
aVShe and I were in the early stages of planning,
p83
aVas we had intended to go together,
p84
aVwhen she fell victim to a brain tumor.
p85
aVThe cancer quickly took over her body and mind,
p86
aVand she passed away six months later.
p87
aVDuring the months of her illness, though,
p88
aVher dedication to the expedition never wavered, and I made a promise
p89
aVto carry out her final journey.
p90
aa(lp91
VMy mother's passion for the Arctic
p92
aVechoed through my experience in Greenland,
p93
aVand I felt the power
p94
aVand the fragility of the landscape.
p95
aVThe sheer size of the icebergs
p96
aVis humbling.
p97
aVThe ice fields are alive with movement and sound
p98
aVin a way that I never expected.
p99
aVI expanded the scale of my compositions
p100
aVto give you that same sense of awe that I experienced.
p101
aVYet, while the grandeur of the ice is evident,
p102
aVso, too, is its vulnerability.
p103
aVFrom our boat,
p104
aVI could see the ice sweating under the unseasonably warm sun.
p105
aa(lp106
VWe had a chance to visit many of the Inuit communities in Greenland
p107
aVthat now face huge challenges.
p108
aVThe locals spoke to me of vast areas of sea ice
p109
aVthat are no longer freezing over as they once did.
p110
aVAnd without ice, their hunting and harvesting grounds
p111
aVare severely diminished,
p112
aVthreatening their way of life and survival.
p113
aa(lp114
VThe melting glaciers in Greenland
p115
aVare one of the largest contributing factors to rising sea levels,
p116
aVwhich have already begun to drown
p117
aVsome of our world's lowest-lying islands.
p118
aVOne year after my trip to Greenland, I visited the Maldives,
p119
aVthe lowest and flattest country in the entire world.
p120
aVWhile I was there, I collected images and inspiration
p121
aVfor a new body of work:
p122
aVdrawings of waves lapping on the coast of a nation
p123
aVthat could be entirely underwater within this century.
p124
aa(lp125
VDevastating events happen every day
p126
aVon scales both global and personal.
p127
aVWhen I was in Greenland,
p128
aVI scattered my mother's ashes amidst the melting ice.
p129
aVNow she remains a part of the landscape she loved so much,
p130
aVeven as it, too, passes and takes on new form.
p131
aa(lp132
VAmong the many gifts my mother gave me
p133
aVwas the ability to focus on the positive,
p134
aVrather than the negative.
p135
aVMy drawings celebrate the beauty of what we all stand to lose.
p136
aVI hope they can serve as records of sublime landscapes in flux,
p137
aVdocumenting the transition and inspiring our global community
p138
aVto take action for the future.
p139
aa(lp140
VThank you.

She was born in South Natick, Massachusetts and currently works and resides in Brooklyn, New York. She studied at the Student Art Centers International in Florence, Italy and received a BS in Studio Arts at Skidmore College in New York.

Zaria Forman&#39;s drawings began in early childhood when she traveled with her family throughout several of the world&#39;s most remote landscapes, which were the subject of her mother&#39;s fine art photography. She was born in South Natick, Massachusetts and currently works and resides in Brooklyn, New York. She studied at the Student Art Centers International in Florence, Italy and received a BS in Studio Arts at Skidmore College in New York. Her works have been in publications such as <em>Juxtapoz</em> Magazine, <em>National Geographic</em> Magazine, Huffington Post, and the Smithsonian Magazine.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">Recent achievements include participation in Banksy&#39;s Dismaland and a solo exhibition at Winston W&auml;chter Fine Art in New York in September and October of 2015. Her drawings have been used in the set design for the Netflix TV series <em>House of Cards</em>.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">In August 2012, Forman led Chasing the Light, an expedition sailing up the coast of Greenland, retracing the 1869 journey of American painter William Bradford and documenting the rapidly changing arctic landscape. Continuing to address climate change in her work, Forman traveled multiple times to the Maldives, the lowest-lying country in the world, and arguably the most vulnerable to rising sea levels.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">Forman was invited aboard the National Geographic <em>Explorer</em>, traveling to Antarctica&nbsp;as an artist-in-residence in November and December 2015. Her next solo show will take place at Winston W&auml;chter Fine Art&rsquo;s Seattle location, in February and March of 2017.</p>", "slug": "zaria_forman", "whotheyare": "Zaria Forman uses visual art to connect people with the impact of climate change.", "whatotherssay": "", "id": 2792, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/22f273d1cee50e1e41a618200e817efbcadcb576_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "Drawings that show the beauty and fragility of Earth", "take_action": [{"status": "approved", "start_at": null, "link_url": "http://www.zariaforman.com/#!reduce-your-carbon-footprint/o3lxn", "eyebrow": null, "end_at": null, "verb": "learn", "published": true, "visible_url": "zariaforman.com", "type": "take_action", "blurb": "**Learn** what you can do to reduce your carbon footprint."}], "comments": 27129, "more_resources": [], "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/0a99f16774299363d9cdd9efcee9163ba2f52e89_2880x1620.jpg", "description": "Zaria Forman\'s large-scale compositions of melting glaciers, icebergs floating in glassy water and waves cresting with foam explore moments of transition, turbulence and tranquility.

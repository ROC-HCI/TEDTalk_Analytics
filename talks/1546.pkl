VI want to talk to you today about something
p5
aVthe open-source programming world can teach democracy,
p6
aVbut before that, a little preamble.
p7
aVLet's start here.
p8
aa(lp9
VThis is Martha Payne. Martha's a 9-year-old Scot
p10
aVwho lives in the Council of Argyll and Bute.
p11
aVA couple months ago, Payne started a food blog
p12
aVcalled NeverSeconds, and she would take her camera
p13
aVwith her every day to school to document
p14
aVher school lunches.
p15
aVCan you spot the vegetable? (Laughter)
p16
aVAnd, as sometimes happens,
p17
aVthis blog acquired first dozens of readers,
p18
aVand then hundreds of readers,
p19
aVand then thousands of readers, as people tuned in
p20
aVto watch her rate her school lunches,
p21
aVincluding on my favorite category,
p22
aV"Pieces of hair found in food." (Laughter)
p23
aVThis was a zero day. That's good.
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd then two weeks ago yesterday, she posted this.
p26
aVA post that read: "Goodbye."
p27
aVAnd she said, "I'm very sorry to tell you this, but
p28
aVmy head teacher pulled me out of class today and told me
p29
aVI'm not allowed to take pictures in the lunch room anymore.
p30
aVI really enjoyed doing this.
p31
aVThank you for reading. Goodbye."
p32
aa(lp33
VYou can guess what happened next, right? (Laughter)
p34
aVThe outrage was so swift, so voluminous, so unanimous,
p35
aVthat the Council of Argyll and Bute reversed themselves
p36
aVthe same day and said, "We would,
p37
aVwe would never censor a nine-year-old." (Laughter)
p38
aVExcept, of course, this morning. (Laughter)
p39
aVAnd this brings up the question,
p40
aVwhat made them think they could get away
p41
aVwith something like that? (Laughter)
p42
aVAnd the answer is, all of human history prior to now.
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter) So,
p45
aVwhat happens when a medium suddenly puts
p46
aVa lot of new ideas into circulation?
p47
aa(lp48
VNow, this isn't just a contemporaneous question.
p49
aVThis is something we've faced several times
p50
aVover the last few centuries.
p51
aVWhen the telegraph came along, it was clear
p52
aVthat it was going to globalize the news industry.
p53
aVWhat would this lead to?
p54
aVWell, obviously, it would lead to world peace.
p55
aVThe television, a medium that allowed us not just to hear
p56
aVbut see, literally see, what was going on
p57
aVelsewhere in the world, what would this lead to?
p58
aVWorld peace. (Laughter)
p59
aVThe telephone?
p60
aVYou guessed it: world peace.
p61
aVSorry for the spoiler alert, but no world peace. Not yet.
p62
aVEven the printing press, even the printing press
p63
aVwas assumed to be a tool that was going to enforce
p64
aVCatholic intellectual hegemony across Europe.
p65
aVInstead, what we got was Martin Luther's 95 Theses,
p66
aVthe Protestant Reformation, and, you know,
p67
aVthe Thirty Years' War. All right,
p68
aVso what all of these predictions of world peace got right
p69
aVis that when a lot of new ideas suddenly
p70
aVcome into circulation, it changes society.
p71
aVWhat they got exactly wrong was what happens next.
p72
aa(lp73
VThe more ideas there are in circulation,
p74
aVthe more ideas there are for any individual to disagree with.
p75
aVMore media always means more arguing.
p76
aVThat's what happens when the media's space expands.
p77
aVAnd yet, when we look back on the printing press
p78
aVin the early years, we like what happened.
p79
aVWe are a pro-printing press society.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo how do we square those two things,
p82
aVthat it leads to more arguing, but we think it was good?
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd the answer, I think, can be found in things like this.
p85
aVThis is the cover of "Philosophical Transactions,"
p86
aVthe first scientific journal ever published in English
p87
aVin the middle of the 1600s,
p88
aVand it was created by a group of people who had been
p89
aVcalling themselves "The Invisible College,"
p90
aVa group of natural philosophers who only later
p91
aVwould call themselves scientists,
p92
aVand they wanted to improve the way
p93
aVnatural philosophers argued with each other,
p94
aVand they needed to do two things for this.
p95
aVThey needed openness. They needed to create a norm
p96
aVwhich said, when you do an experiment,
p97
aVyou have to publish not just your claims,
p98
aVbut how you did the experiment.
p99
aVIf you don't tell us how you did it, we won't trust you.
p100
aVBut the other thing they needed was speed.
p101
aVThey had to quickly synchronize what
p102
aVother natural philosophers knew. Otherwise,
p103
aVyou couldn't get the right kind of argument going.
p104
aVThe printing press was clearly the right medium for this,
p105
aVbut the book was the wrong tool. It was too slow.
p106
aVAnd so they invented the scientific journal
p107
aVas a way of synchronizing the argument
p108
aVacross the community of natural scientists.
p109
aVThe scientific revolution wasn't created by the printing press.
p110
aVIt was created by scientists,
p111
aVbut it couldn't have been created if they didn't have
p112
aVa printing press as a tool.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo what about us? What about our generation,
p115
aVand our media revolution, the Internet?
p116
aVWell, predictions of world peace? Check. (Laughter)
p117
aVMore arguing? Gold star on that one. (Laughter)
p118
aV(Laughter)
p119
aVI mean, YouTube is just a gold mine. (Laughter)
p120
aVBetter arguing? That's the question.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo I study social media, which means,
p123
aVto a first approximation, I watch people argue.
p124
aVAnd if I had to pick a group that I think is
p125
aVour Invisible College, is our generation's collection of people
p126
aVtrying to take these tools and to press it into service,
p127
aVnot for more arguments, but for better arguments,
p128
aVI'd pick the open-source programmers.
p129
aVProgramming is a three-way relationship
p130
aVbetween a programmer, some source code,
p131
aVand the computer it's meant to run on, but computers
p132
aVare such famously inflexible interpreters of instructions
p133
aVthat it's extraordinarily difficult to write out a set
p134
aVof instructions that the computer knows how to execute,
p135
aVand that's if one person is writing it.
p136
aVOnce you get more than one person writing it,
p137
aVit's very easy for any two programmers to overwrite
p138
aVeach other's work if they're working on the same file,
p139
aVor to send incompatible instructions
p140
aVthat simply causes the computer to choke,
p141
aVand this problem grows larger
p142
aVthe more programmers are involved.
p143
aVTo a first approximation, the problem of managing
p144
aVa large software project is the problem
p145
aVof keeping this social chaos at bay.
p146
aa(lp147
VNow, for decades there has been a canonical solution
p148
aVto this problem, which is to use something called
p149
aVa "version control system,"
p150
aVand a version control system does what is says on the tin.
p151
aVIt provides a canonical copy of the software
p152
aVon a server somewhere.
p153
aVThe only programmers who can change it are people
p154
aVwho've specifically been given permission to access it,
p155
aVand they're only allowed to access the sub-section of it
p156
aVthat they have permission to change.
p157
aVAnd when people draw diagrams of version control systems,
p158
aVthe diagrams always look something like this.
p159
aVAll right. They look like org charts.
p160
aVAnd you don't have to squint very hard
p161
aVto see the political ramifications of a system like this.
p162
aVThis is feudalism: one owner, many workers.
p163
aa(lp164
VNow, that's fine for the commercial software industry.
p165
aVIt really is Microsoft's Office. It's Adobe's Photoshop.
p166
aVThe corporation owns the software.
p167
aVThe programmers come and go.
p168
aa(lp169
VBut there was one programmer who decided
p170
aVthat this wasn't the way to work.
p171
aVThis is Linus Torvalds.
p172
aVTorvalds is the most famous open-source programmer,
p173
aVcreated Linux, obviously, and Torvalds looked at the way
p174
aVthe open-source movement had been dealing with this problem.
p175
aVOpen-source software, the core promise of the open-source license,
p176
aVis that everybody should have access to all the source code
p177
aVall the time, but of course, this creates
p178
aVthe very threat of chaos you have to forestall
p179
aVin order to get anything working.
p180
aVSo most open-source projects just held their noses
p181
aVand adopted the feudal management systems.
p182
aa(lp183
VBut Torvalds said, "No, I'm not going to do that."
p184
aVHis point of view on this was very clear.
p185
aVWhen you adopt a tool, you also adopt
p186
aVthe management philosophy embedded in that tool,
p187
aVand he wasn't going to adopt anything that didn't work
p188
aVthe way the Linux community worked.
p189
aVAnd to give you a sense of how enormous
p190
aVa decision like this was, this is a map
p191
aVof the internal dependencies within Linux,
p192
aVwithin the Linux operating system, which sub-parts
p193
aVof the program rely on which other sub-parts to get going.
p194
aVThis is a tremendously complicated process.
p195
aVThis is a tremendously complicated program,
p196
aVand yet, for years, Torvalds ran this
p197
aVnot with automated tools but out of his email box.
p198
aVPeople would literally mail him changes
p199
aVthat they'd agreed on, and he would merge them by hand.
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd then, 15 years after looking at Linux and figuring out
p202
aVhow the community worked, he said, "I think I know
p203
aVhow to write a version control system for free people."
p204
aa(lp205
VAnd he called it "Git." Git is distributed version control.
p206
aVIt has two big differences
p207
aVwith traditional version control systems.
p208
aVThe first is that it lives up to the philosophical promise
p209
aVof open-source. Everybody who works on a project
p210
aVhas access to all of the source code all of the time.
p211
aVAnd when people draw diagrams of Git workflow,
p212
aVthey use drawings that look like this.
p213
aVAnd you don't have to understand what the circles
p214
aVand boxes and arrows mean to see that this is a far more
p215
aVcomplicated way of working than is supported
p216
aVby ordinary version control systems.
p217
aa(lp218
VBut this is also the thing that brings the chaos back,
p219
aVand this is Git's second big innovation.
p220
aVThis is a screenshot from GitHub, the premier Git hosting service,
p221
aVand every time a programmer uses Git
p222
aVto make any important change at all,
p223
aVcreating a new file, modifying an existing one,
p224
aVmerging two files, Git creates this kind of signature.
p225
aVThis long string of numbers and letters here
p226
aVis a unique identifier tied to every single change,
p227
aVbut without any central coordination.
p228
aVEvery Git system generates this number the same way,
p229
aVwhich means this is a signature tied directly
p230
aVand unforgeably to a particular change.
p231
aa(lp232
VThis has the following effect:
p233
aVA programmer in Edinburgh and a programmer in Entebbe
p234
aVcan both get the same \u2014 a copy of the same piece of software.
p235
aVEach of them can make changes and they can merge them
p236
aVafter the fact even if they didn't know
p237
aVof each other's existence beforehand.
p238
aVThis is cooperation without coordination.
p239
aVThis is the big change.
p240
aa(lp241
VNow, I tell you all of this not to convince you that it's great
p242
aVthat open-source programmers now have a tool
p243
aVthat supports their philosophical way of working,
p244
aValthough I think that is great.
p245
aVI tell you all of this because of what I think it means
p246
aVfor the way communities come together.
p247
aa(lp248
VOnce Git allowed for cooperation without coordination,
p249
aVyou start to see communities form
p250
aVthat are enormously large and complex.
p251
aa(lp252
VThis is a graph of the Ruby community.
p253
aVIt's an open-source programming language,
p254
aVand all of the interconnections between the people \u2014
p255
aVthis is now not a software graph, but a people graph,
p256
aVall of the interconnections among the people
p257
aVworking on that project \u2014
p258
aVand this doesn't look like an org chart.
p259
aVThis looks like a dis-org chart, and yet,
p260
aVout of this community, but using these tools,
p261
aVthey can now create something together.
p262
aVSo there are two good reasons to think that
p263
aVthis kind of technique can be applied
p264
aVto democracies in general and in particular to the law.
p265
aa(lp266
VWhen you make the claim, in fact,
p267
aVthat something on the Internet is going to be good
p268
aVfor democracy, you often get this reaction.
p269
aa(lp270
V(Music) (Laughter)
p271
aa(lp272
VWhich is, are you talking about the thing
p273
aVwith the singing cats? Like, is that the thing
p274
aVyou think is going to be good for society?
p275
aVTo which I have to say, here's the thing
p276
aVwith the singing cats. That always happens.
p277
aVAnd I don't just mean that always happens with the Internet,
p278
aVI mean that always happens with media, full stop.
p279
aVIt did not take long after the rise
p280
aVof the commercial printing press before someone
p281
aVfigured out that erotic novels were a good idea. (Laughter)
p282
aVYou don't have to have an economic incentive to sell books
p283
aVvery long before someone says, "Hey, you know what I bet
p284
aVpeople would pay for?" (Laughter)
p285
aVIt took people another 150 years to even think
p286
aVof the scientific journal, right? So \u2014 (Laughter) (Applause)
p287
aa(lp288
VSo the harnessing by the Invisible College
p289
aVof the printing press to create the scientific journal
p290
aVwas phenomenally important, but it didn't happen big,
p291
aVand it didn't happen quick, and it didn't happen fast, so
p292
aVif you're going to look for where the change is happening,
p293
aVyou have to look on the margins.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo, the law is also dependency-related.
p296
aVThis is a graph of the U.S. Tax Code,
p297
aVand the dependencies of one law on other laws
p298
aVfor the overall effect.
p299
aVSo there's that as a site for source code management.
p300
aVBut there's also the fact that law is another place
p301
aVwhere there are many opinions in circulation,
p302
aVbut they need to be resolved to one canonical copy,
p303
aVand when you go onto GitHub, and you look around,
p304
aVthere are millions and millions of projects,
p305
aValmost all of which are source code,
p306
aVbut if you look around the edges, you can see people
p307
aVexperimenting with the political ramifications
p308
aVof a system like that.
p309
aVSomeone put up all the Wikileaked cables
p310
aVfrom the State Department, along with software used
p311
aVto interpret them, including my favorite use ever
p312
aVof the Cablegate cables, which is a tool for detecting
p313
aVnaturally occurring haiku in State Department prose.
p314
aV(Laughter)
p315
aVRight. (Laughter)
p316
aVThe New York Senate has put up something called
p317
aVOpen Legislation, also hosting it on GitHub,
p318
aVagain for all of the reasons of updating and fluidity.
p319
aVYou can go and pick your Senator and then you can see
p320
aVa list of bills they have sponsored.
p321
aVSomeone going by Divegeek has put up the Utah code,
p322
aVthe laws of the state of Utah, and they've put it up there
p323
aVnot just to distribute the code,
p324
aVbut with the very interesting possibility that this could
p325
aVbe used to further the development of legislation.
p326
aVSomebody put up a tool during the copyright debate
p327
aVlast year in the Senate, saying, "It's strange that Hollywood
p328
aVhas more access to Canadian legislators
p329
aVthan Canadian citizens do. Why don't we use GitHub
p330
aVto show them what a citizen-developed bill might look like?"
p331
aVAnd it includes this very evocative screenshot.
p332
aa(lp333
VThis is a called a "diff," this thing on the right here.
p334
aVThis shows you, for text that many people are editing,
p335
aVwhen a change was made, who made it,
p336
aVand what the change is.
p337
aVThe stuff in red is the stuff that got deleted.
p338
aVThe stuff in green is the stuff that got added.
p339
aVProgrammers take this capability for granted.
p340
aVNo democracy anywhere in the world offers this feature
p341
aVto its citizens for either legislation or for budgets,
p342
aVeven though those are the things done
p343
aVwith our consent and with our money.
p344
aa(lp345
VNow, I would love to tell you that the fact
p346
aVthat the open-source programmers have worked out
p347
aVa collaborative method that is large scale, distributed,
p348
aVcheap, and in sync with the ideals of democracy, I would love
p349
aVto tell you that because those tools are in place,
p350
aVthe innovation is inevitable. But it's not.
p351
aVPart of the problem, of course, is just a lack of information.
p352
aVSomebody put a question up on Quora saying,
p353
aV"Why is it that lawmakers don't use
p354
aVdistributed version control?"
p355
aVThis, graphically, was the answer. (Laughter)
p356
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p357
aVAnd that is indeed part of the problem, but only part.
p358
aa(lp359
VThe bigger problem, of course, is power.
p360
aVThe people experimenting with participation don't have
p361
aVlegislative power, and the people who have legislative
p362
aVpower are not experimenting with participation.
p363
aVThey are experimenting with openness.
p364
aVThere's no democracy worth the name that doesn't have
p365
aVa transparency move, but transparency is openness
p366
aVin only one direction, and being given a dashboard
p367
aVwithout a steering wheel has never been the core promise
p368
aVa democracy makes to its citizens.
p369
aa(lp370
VSo consider this.
p371
aVThe thing that got Martha Payne's opinions
p372
aVout into the public was a piece of technology,
p373
aVbut the thing that kept them there was political will.
p374
aVIt was the expectation of the citizens
p375
aVthat she would not be censored.
p376
aVThat's now the state we're in with these collaboration tools.
p377
aVWe have them. We've seen them. They work.
p378
aVCan we use them?
p379
aVCan we apply the techniques that worked here to this?
p380
aa(lp381
VT.S. Eliot once said, "One of the most momentous things
p382
aVthat can happen to a culture
p383
aVis that they acquire a new form of prose."
p384
aVI think that's wrong, but \u2014 (Laughter)
p385
aVI think it's right for argumentation. Right?
p386
aVA momentous thing that can happen to a culture
p387
aVis they can acquire a new style of arguing:
p388
aVtrial by jury, voting, peer review, now this. Right?
p389
aa(lp390
VA new form of arguing has been invented in our lifetimes,
p391
aVin the last decade, in fact.
p392
aVIt's large, it's distributed, it's low-cost,
p393
aVand it's compatible with the ideals of democracy.
p394
aVThe question for us now is, are we going to let
p395
aVthe programmers keep it to themselves?
p396
aVOr are we going to try and take it and press it into service
p397
aVfor society at large?
p398
aa(lp399
VThank you for listening. (Applause)
p400
aV(Applause)
p401
aVThank you. Thank you. (Applause)

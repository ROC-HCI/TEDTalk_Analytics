VActually, I come from Britain,
p5
aVbut I've been living in Maldives for 26 years now.
p6
aVSo, that's home really.
p7
aVThe Maldives, as I'm sure you're aware, are a chain of islands
p8
aVoff the southwest coast of India here.
p9
aVCapital, Malé, where I live.
p10
aVActually, sitting here today in Mysore,
p11
aVwe're closer to Malé than we are to Delhi, for example.
p12
aa(lp13
VIf you're in IT, India, obviously, is the place to be at the moment.
p14
aVBut if you're a marine biologist, Maldives is not such a bad place to be.
p15
aVAnd it has been my home these years.
p16
aVFor those of you who've been there, fantastic coral reefs,
p17
aVfantastic diving, fantastic snorkeling.
p18
aVI spend as much of my time as possible
p19
aVinvestigating the marine life.
p20
aVI study fish,
p21
aValso the bigger things, whales and dolphins.
p22
aa(lp23
VThis is a blue whale. We have blue whales
p24
aVin the waters around here, off Maldives,
p25
aVaround the waters of India. You can see them off Kerala.
p26
aVAnd, in fact, we're very lucky in this region.
p27
aVOne of the best places in the world to see blue whales
p28
aVis here in this region.
p29
aVIn Sri Lanka, if you go down to the south coast of Sri Lanka,
p30
aVduring the northeast monsoon season,
p31
aVyou can see blue whales very, very easily.
p32
aVIt's probably the best place in the world to see them.
p33
aa(lp34
VNow, when I talk about the northeast monsoon season,
p35
aVI'm sure many of you here know exactly what I mean,
p36
aVbut perhaps some of you are not quite so sure.
p37
aVI need to explain a little bit about monsoons.
p38
aVNow, monsoon, the root of the word "monsoon"
p39
aVcomes from the word "season."
p40
aa(lp41
VSo, it's just a season. And there are two seasons in most of South Asia.
p42
aVAnd in the summer India heats up, gets very hot.
p43
aVHot air rises, and air is drawn in off the sea to replace it.
p44
aVAnd the way it works is, it comes from the southwest.
p45
aVIt comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards India.
p46
aVSo it comes from the southwest. It's a southwest monsoon.
p47
aVPicks up moisture as it crosses the ocean.
p48
aVThat's what brings the monsoon rain.
p49
aVAnd then in the winter things cool down.
p50
aVHigh pressure builds over India.
p51
aVAnd the whole system goes into reverse.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo, the wind is now coming from the northeast
p54
aVout of India, across the Indian Ocean,
p55
aVthis way towards Africa.
p56
aVKeep that in mind.
p57
aVNow, I'm a marine biologist, but I'm actually
p58
aVa bit of an old fashioned naturalist, I suppose.
p59
aVI'm interested in all sorts of things, almost everything that moves,
p60
aVincluding dragonflies. And I'm actually
p61
aVgoing to talk, this afternoon, about dragonflies.
p62
aVThis is a very beautiful species, it's called the Oriental Scarlet.
p63
aa(lp64
VAnd one thing you need to know about dragonflies,
p65
aVone important thing,
p66
aVis that they lay their eggs in fresh water.
p67
aVThey need fresh water to breed.
p68
aVThey lay the eggs into fresh water.
p69
aVLittle larvae hatch out in fresh water.
p70
aVThey feed on other little things. They feed on mosquito larvae.
p71
aVSo, they're very important.
p72
aVThey control mosquito larvae, among other things.
p73
aVAnd they grow and grow by stages. And they climb out
p74
aVof the water, burst out, as the adult which we see.
p75
aVAnd typically, there is a lot of variation,
p76
aVbut if you have a dragonfly with, say, a one year life cycle,
p77
aVwhich is quite typical, the larva, living in the fresh water,
p78
aVlives for 10 or 11 months.
p79
aVAnd then the adult, which comes after, lives for one or two months.
p80
aVSo it's essentially a freshwater animal.
p81
aVIt really does need fresh water.
p82
aa(lp83
VNow, the particular species of dragonfly
p84
aVI want to talk about is this one,
p85
aVbecause most dragonflies, like the one we've just seen,
p86
aVwhen the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life,
p87
aVit doesn't go very far. It can't travel very far.
p88
aVA few kilometers, maybe, is quite typical.
p89
aVThey are very good fliers, but they don't go too far.
p90
aVBut this guy is an exception.
p91
aVAnd this is called the Globe Skimmer,
p92
aVor Wandering Glider.
p93
aVAnd, as the name might suggest, it is found pretty much around the world.
p94
aVIt lives throughout the tropics, the Americas,
p95
aVAfrica, Asia, Australia, into the Pacific.
p96
aVAnd it wanders far and wide. We know that much about it.
p97
aVBut it really hasn't been studied very much.
p98
aa(lp99
VIt's a rather mediocre looking dragonfly.
p100
aVIf you're going to study dragonflies, you want to study those really bright beautiful ones,
p101
aVlike that red one. Or the really rare ones, the endemic endangered ones.
p102
aVThis is, it seems a bit dull you know.
p103
aVIt's sort of dull-colored. And it's fairly common.
p104
aVAnd it occurs everywhere \u2014 you know, why bother?
p105
aVBut if you take that attitude, you're actually missing something rather special.
p106
aVBecause this dragonfly has a rather amazing story to tell.
p107
aVAnd I feel very privileged to have stumbled across it
p108
aVliving in the Maldives.
p109
aa(lp110
VWhen I first went to the Maldives,
p111
aVdead keen on diving, spent as much of my time
p112
aVas I could in and under the water.
p113
aVDidn't notice any dragonflies; maybe they were there, maybe they weren't.
p114
aVDidn't notice them.
p115
aVBut after some time, after some months, one day
p116
aVas I was going out and about,
p117
aVsuddenly I noticed hundreds of dragonflies, hundreds of dragonflies.
p118
aVSomething like this, these are all this species Globe Skimmer.
p119
aVI didn't know at the time, but I know now,
p120
aVthey're Globe Skimmers, hundreds of them.
p121
aVAnd they were there for some time. And then they were gone.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd I didn't think anything more of it until
p124
aVthe following year, when it happened again,
p125
aVand then the year after that, and then the year after that.
p126
aVAnd I was a bit slow, I didn't really take too much notice.
p127
aVBut I asked some Maldivian friends and colleagues, and yes they come every year.
p128
aVAnd I asked people about them and yes,
p129
aVthey knew, but they didn't know anything,
p130
aVwhere they came from, or anything.
p131
aVAnd again I didn't think too much of it.
p132
aVBut slowly it began to dawn on me that something
p133
aVrather special was happening.
p134
aa(lp135
VBecause dragonflies need fresh water to breed.
p136
aVAnd the Maldives, and I'm sure some of you have been there \u2014
p137
aVso here is home.
p138
aVSo, Maldives, beautiful place.
p139
aV(Laughter)
p140
aVIt's built entirely of coral reefs.
p141
aVAnd on top of the coral reefs are sand banks.
p142
aVAverage height, about that much above sea level.
p143
aVSo, global warming, sea level rise, it's a real serious issue.
p144
aVBut I'm not going to talk about that.
p145
aVAnother important point of these sand banks
p146
aVis that when it rains,
p147
aVthe rainwater soaks down into the soil. So, it's gone.
p148
aVSo, it stays under the soil.
p149
aVThe trees can put their roots into it.
p150
aVHumans can dig holes and make a well.
p151
aa(lp152
VBut dragonflies \u2014 a bit tricky.
p153
aVThere is no surface fresh water.
p154
aVThere are no ponds, streams, rivers, lakes,
p155
aVnothing like that.
p156
aVSo, why is it that every year
p157
aVmillions of dragonflies, millions,
p158
aVmillions of dragonflies turn up?
p159
aVI got a little bit curious. In fact I'll stop here,
p160
aVbecause I want to ask, and there is a lot of people who,
p161
aVfrom India of course, people who grew up spending your childhood here.
p162
aVThose of you who are Indian or spent your childhood here,
p163
aVlet me have a show of hands, who of you \u2014
p164
aVnot yet, not yet!
p165
aVYou're too keen. You're too keen. No. Hang on. Hang on.
p166
aVWait for the go. I'll say go.
p167
aa(lp168
VThose of you who grew up in India,
p169
aVdo you remember in your childhood, dragonflies,
p170
aVswarms of dragonflies? Maybe at school,
p171
aVmaybe tying little bits of string onto them?
p172
aVMaybe pulling bits off? I'm not asking about that.
p173
aVYou've only got to say, do you remember seeing lots of dragonflies.
p174
aVAny hands? Any hands? Yes. Thank you. Thank you.
p175
aVIt's a widespread phenomenon
p176
aVthroughout South Asia, including the Maldives.
p177
aVAnd I got a bit curious about it.
p178
aa(lp179
VIn the Maldives \u2014 now, in India there is plenty of water,
p180
aVso, dragonflies, yeah, of course. Why not?
p181
aVBut in Maldives, no fresh water. So, what on Earth is going on?
p182
aVAnd the first thing I did was started recording
p183
aVwhen they turned up in the Maldives.
p184
aVAnd there is the answer, 21st of October.
p185
aVNot every year, that's the average date.
p186
aVSo, I've been writing it down for 15 years now.
p187
aVYou'd think they're coming from India. It's the closest place.
p188
aVBut in October, remember, we're still in southwest monsoon,
p189
aVMaldives is still in the southwest monsoon.
p190
aVBut wind is, invariably, every time, is from the west.
p191
aVIt's going towards India, not from India.
p192
aVSo, are these things, how are these things getting here?
p193
aVAre they coming from India against the wind?
p194
aVSeemed a bit unlikely.
p195
aa(lp196
VSo, next thing I did is I got on the phone.
p197
aVMaldives is a long archipelago.
p198
aVIt stretches about 500 miles, of course it's India here.
p199
aVI got on the phone and emailed to friends and colleagues.
p200
aVWhen do you see the dragonflies appear?
p201
aVAnd pretty soon, a picture started emerging.
p202
aVIn Bangalore, a colleague there sent me
p203
aVinformation for three years, average,
p204
aV24th of September, so late September.
p205
aVDown in Trivandrum, a bit later.
p206
aVFar north of Maldives, a bit later.
p207
aVThen Malé, then further south.
p208
aVAnd then the southernmost Maldives.
p209
aVIt's pretty obvious, they're coming from India.
p210
aVBut they are coming 400 miles across the ocean, against the wind.
p211
aVHow on Earth are they doing that?
p212
aVI didn't know.
p213
aa(lp214
VThe next thing I did was I started counting dragonflies.
p215
aVI wanted to know about their seasonality,
p216
aVwhat time of year, this is when they first arrive,
p217
aVbut how long are they around for? Does that give any clues?
p218
aVSo, I started a very rigorous scientific process.
p219
aVI had a rigorous scientific transect.
p220
aVI got on my bicycle,
p221
aVand I cycled around the island of Malé.
p222
aVIt's about five kilometers around,
p223
aVcounting the dragonflies as I go,
p224
aVtrying not to bump into people as I'm looking in the trees.
p225
aa(lp226
VAnd they're here for a very short time,
p227
aVOctober, November, December. That's it.
p228
aVAnd then they tail off, there's a few, but that's it.
p229
aVOctober, November, December. That is not the northeast monsoon season.
p230
aVThat's not the southwest season.
p231
aVThat's the inter-monsoon,
p232
aVthe time when the monsoon changes.
p233
aa(lp234
VNow, what I said was, you get the southwest monsoon going one way,
p235
aVand then it changes and you get the northeast monsoon going the other way.
p236
aVAnd that sort of gives the impression you've got one air mass
p237
aVgoing up and down, up and down. It doesn't work like that.
p238
aVWhat happens, actually, is there is two air masses.
p239
aVAnd there is a front between them, and the front moves.
p240
aVSo, if you've got India here,
p241
aVwhen the front is up above India you're into the southwest monsoon.
p242
aVThen the front moves into the northeast monsoon.
p243
aVAnd that front in the middle is not vertical,
p244
aVit's at an angle.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo, as it comes over towards Malé
p247
aVI'm standing in Malé underneath the front.
p248
aVI can be in the southwest monsoon.
p249
aVBut the wind above is from the northeast monsoon.
p250
aVSo, the dragonflies are actually coming from India on the northeast monsoon,
p251
aVbut at an altitude at 1,000 to 2,000 meters up in the air. Incredible.
p252
aVThese little insects, it's the same ones we see out here [in India],
p253
aVtwo inches long, five centimeters long,
p254
aVflying in their millions, 400 miles across the ocean,
p255
aVat 2,000 meters up. Quite incredible.
p256
aa(lp257
VSo, I was quite pleased with myself. I thought wow, I've tracked this one,
p258
aVI know how they come here. Then I scratched my head a bit,
p259
aVand that's okay,
p260
aVI know how they come here, but why do they come here?
p261
aVWhat are millions of dragonflies doing, flying out over the ocean every year
p262
aVto their apparent doom?
p263
aVIt doesn't make sense. There is nothing for them in Maldives.
p264
aVWhat on Earth are they doing?
p265
aVWell, to cut a long story short,
p266
aVthey're actually flying right across the ocean.
p267
aVThey're making it all the way across to East Africa.
p268
aa(lp269
VI know that because I have friends who work on fisheries' research vessels
p270
aVwho have sent to me reports from boats out in the ocean.
p271
aVI know because we have reports from Seychelles,
p272
aVwhich fit in as well, down here.
p273
aVAnd I know because
p274
aVwhen you look at the rainfall,
p275
aVthese particular insects, these Globe Skimmers
p276
aVbreed in temporary rain water pools.
p277
aVOkay, they lay their eggs where the seasonal rains are,
p278
aVthe monsoon rains.
p279
aVThe larvae have to develop very quickly.
p280
aVThey only take six weeks. Instead of 11 months, they're six weeks.
p281
aVThey're up, and they're off.
p282
aa(lp283
VNow, here we have, in case you can't read at the back,
p284
aVthe top is rainfall for India.
p285
aVAnd we're starting in June. So this is the monsoon rain.
p286
aVBy September, October, it's drying out.
p287
aVNothing for these dragonflies. There is no more seasonal rain.
p288
aVThey've got to go hunting for seasonal rain.
p289
aVAnd they fly south. As the monsoon withdraws to the south
p290
aVthey come down through Karnataka, into Kerala.
p291
aVAnd then they run out of land.
p292
aVBut they are incredibly good fliers. This particular species,
p293
aVit can fly for thousands of kilometers.
p294
aVAnd it just keeps going. And the wind, the northeast wind
p295
aVswooshes it around and carries it off across the ocean to Africa,
p296
aVwhere it's raining.
p297
aVAnd they are breeding in the rains of Africa.
p298
aVNow, this is southeast Africa. It makes it look like there are sort of
p299
aVtwo breeding periods here. It's slightly more complicated than that.
p300
aa(lp301
VWhat's happening is they are breeding in the monsoon rains here.
p302
aVAnd the dragonflies you can see today
p303
aVoutside here, on the campus,
p304
aVare the young of this generation.
p305
aVThey hatched out in India.
p306
aVThey're looking for somewhere to breed. If it rains here they'll breed.
p307
aVBut most of them are going to carry on. And next stop,
p308
aVperhaps only four or five days away is going to be East Africa.
p309
aVThe wind will swoosh them out across here.
p310
aVIf they pass the Maldives they might go and have a look,
p311
aVnothing there, they'll carry on.
p312
aa(lp313
VHere, here, Kenya, East Africa,
p314
aVthey've actually just come out of a long drought.
p315
aVJust last week the rains broke. The short rains broke
p316
aVand it's raining there now.
p317
aVAnd the dragonflies are there. I have reports from my various contacts.
p318
aVThe dragonflies are here now. They're breeding there.
p319
aVWhen those guys, they'll lay their eggs now.
p320
aVThey'll hatch out in six weeks. By that time
p321
aVthe seasonal rains have moved on. It's not there, it's down here.
p322
aVThey'll fly down here. And the clever thing is
p323
aVthe wind is always converging to where the rain is.
p324
aVThe rain occurs, these are summer rains.
p325
aVThis is a summer monsoon.
p326
aVThe sun is overhead there. Summer rains in southern Africa.
p327
aVThe sun is overhead, maximum heating,
p328
aVmaximum evaporation, maximum clouds,
p329
aVmaximum rainfall,
p330
aVmaximum opportunities for reproduction.
p331
aa(lp332
VNot only that, because you have this convection,
p333
aVyou have this rising of the air
p334
aVwhere it's hot, air is drawn in.
p335
aVThere's a convergence. So, wherever the rain is falling,
p336
aVthe air is drawn towards it to replace the air that's rising.
p337
aVSo, the little fellow that hatches out here,
p338
aVhe gets up into the air, he is automatically carried
p339
aVto where the rain is falling.
p340
aVLay their eggs, next generation, they come up,
p341
aVautomatically carried to where the rain is falling.
p342
aVIt's now back there. They come out, it's time to come back.
p343
aVSo, in four generations, one, two, three,
p344
aVfour and then back.
p345
aa(lp346
VA complete circuit of the Indian Ocean.
p347
aVThis is a circuit of about 16,000 kilometers.
p348
aV16,000 kilometers, four generations, mind you,
p349
aVfor a two inch long insect. It's quite incredible.
p350
aVThose of you from North America
p351
aVwill be familiar with the Monarch butterfly.
p352
aVWhich, up until now has had the longest known insect migration.
p353
aVIt's only half the length of this one.
p354
aVAnd this crossing here, of the ocean,
p355
aVis the only truly regular transoceanic crossing
p356
aVof any insect.
p357
aVA quite incredible feat.
p358
aVAnd I only stumbled on this because I was living in Malé,
p359
aVin Maldives for long enough
p360
aVfor it to percolate into my brain
p361
aVthat something rather special was going on.
p362
aa(lp363
VBut dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing.
p364
aVThere is more to the story.
p365
aVI'm also interested in birds. And I'm familiar
p366
aVwith this fellow. This is a rather special bird.
p367
aVIt's a falcon. It's called the eastern red-footed falcon, obviously.
p368
aVBut it's also called the Amur Falcon.
p369
aVAnd it's called the Amur Falcon
p370
aVbecause it breeds in Amurland.
p371
aVWhich is an area along the Amur River, which is up here.
p372
aVIt's the border, much of it is the border
p373
aVbetween China and Russia, up here in the far east.
p374
aa(lp375
VSo, Siberia, Manchuria.
p376
aVAnd that's where it breeds.
p377
aVAnd if you're a falcon it's quite a nice place to be in the summer.
p378
aVBut it's a pretty miserable place to be in the winter.
p379
aVIt's, well, you can imagine.
p380
aVSo, as any sensible bird would do,
p381
aVhe moves south. They move south. The whole population moves south.
p382
aVBut then the being sensible stopped.
p383
aVSo, now they don't stop here, or even down here.
p384
aVNo, they turn across here.
p385
aVThey have a little refueling stop in northeastern India.
p386
aVThey come to the latitude of about Mumbai or Goa.
p387
aVAnd then they strike out across the ocean, down to Kenya.
p388
aVAnd down here, and they winter down here [in southern Africa].
p389
aVIncredible. This is the most extraordinary migration
p390
aVof any bird of prey. A quite incredible migration.
p391
aa(lp392
VAnd they are not the only one that makes the crossing.
p393
aVThey have the most incredible journey, but several make the crossing from India
p394
aVto Africa. Includes this one, the hobby.
p395
aVThis fellow is a very nice bird, this is the Pied cuckoo.
p396
aVThose of you from northern India will be familiar with this.
p397
aVIt comes with the monsoons.
p398
aVThis time of year they cross back to Africa.
p399
aVAnd this guy, the roller, a rather beautiful bird.
p400
aVIt's known as the Eurasian Roller. In India it occurs in the northwest,
p401
aVso it's known as the Kashmir Roller.
p402
aVAnd these birds, what I've done is I've complied all the records,
p403
aVall the available records of these birds,
p404
aVput them together, and found out they migrate at exactly the same time
p405
aVas the dragonflies.
p406
aVThey make use of exactly the same winds.
p407
aVThey travel at exactly the same time with the same winds
p408
aVto make the crossing. I know they travel at the same altitude.
p409
aa(lp410
VIt's known about the Amur Falcon. This guy, unfortunately,
p411
aVone of these met an unfortunate end.
p412
aVHe was flying off the coast of Goa,
p413
aV21 years ago, 1988. October, 1988.
p414
aVAn Indian Navy jet was flying off Goa,
p415
aVbang! In the middle of the night. Fortunately, a two engine jet
p416

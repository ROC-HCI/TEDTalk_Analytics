VI am sorry I cannot show you my face,
p5
aVbecause if I do, the bad guys will come for me.
p6
aa(lp7
VMy journey started 14 years ago.
p8
aVI was a young reporter. I had just come out of college.
p9
aa(lp10
VThen I got a scoop.
p11
aVThe scoop was quite a very simple story.
p12
aVPolice officers were taking bribes
p13
aVfrom hawkers who were hawking on the streets.
p14
aVAs a young reporter, I thought that I should do it
p15
aVin a different way, so that it has a maximum impact,
p16
aVsince everybody knew that it was happening,
p17
aVand yet there was nothing that was keeping it out of the system.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo I decided to go there
p20
aVand act as a seller.
p21
aVAs part of selling, I was able to document
p22
aVthe hard core evidence.
p23
aVThe impact was great.
p24
aVIt was fantastic.
p25
aa(lp26
VThis was what many call immersion journalism,
p27
aVor undercover journalism.
p28
aVI am an undercover journalist.
p29
aVMy journalism is hinged on three basic principles:
p30
aVnaming, shaming and jailing.
p31
aVJournalism is about results.
p32
aVIt's about affecting your community or your society
p33
aVin the most progressive way.
p34
aVI have worked on this for over 14 years,
p35
aVand I can tell you, the results are very good.
p36
aa(lp37
VOne story that comes to mind
p38
aVin my undercover pieces
p39
aVis "Spirit Child."
p40
aVIt was about children who were born with deformities,
p41
aVand their parents felt that once they were born
p42
aVwith those deformities,
p43
aVthey were not good enough to live in the society,
p44
aVso they were given some concoction to take
p45
aVand as a result they died.
p46
aVSo I built a prosthetic baby,
p47
aVand I went into the village,
p48
aVpretended as though this baby had been born
p49
aVwith a deformity, and here was the guys who do the killing.
p50
aVThey got themselves ready.
p51
aVIn their bids to kill, I got the police on standby,
p52
aVand they came that fateful morning
p53
aVto come and kill the child.
p54
aVI recall how they were seriously boiling the concoction.
p55
aVThey put it on fire. It was boiling hot,
p56
aVgetting ready to give to the kids.
p57
aVWhilst this was going on, the police I had alerted,
p58
aVthey were on standby,
p59
aVand just as the concoction was ready,
p60
aVand they were about to give it to the kids,
p61
aVI phoned the police,
p62
aVand fortunately they came and busted them.
p63
aVAs I speak now, they are before the courts.
p64
aVDon't forget the key principles:
p65
aVnaming, shaming and jailing.
p66
aVThe court process is taking place,
p67
aVand I'm very sure at the end of the day
p68
aVwe will find them, and we will put them
p69
aVwhere they belong too.
p70
aa(lp71
VAnother key story that comes to mind,
p72
aVwhich relates to this spirit child phenomenon,
p73
aVis "The Spell of the Albinos."
p74
aVI'm sure most of you may have heard, in Tanzania,
p75
aVchildren who are born with albinism
p76
aVare sometimes considered as being unfit
p77
aVto live in society.
p78
aVTheir bodies are chopped up with machetes
p79
aVand are supposed to be used for some concoctions
p80
aVor some potions for people to get money \u2014
p81
aVor so many, many stories people would tell about it.
p82
aVIt was time to go undercover again.
p83
aVSo I went undercover as a man who was interested
p84
aVin this particular business, of course.
p85
aVAgain, a prosthetic arm was built.
p86
aVFor the first time, I filmed on hidden camera
p87
aVthe guys who do this, and they were ready to buy the arm
p88
aVand they were ready to use it to prepare
p89
aVthose potions for people.
p90
aa(lp91
VI am glad today the Tanzanian government has taken action,
p92
aVbut the key issue is that the Tanzanian government
p93
aVcould only take action because the evidence was available.
p94
aVMy journalism is about hard core evidence.
p95
aVIf I say you have stolen, I show you the evidence
p96
aVthat you have stolen.
p97
aVI show you how you stole it
p98
aVand when, or what you used
p99
aVwhat you had stolen to do.
p100
aVWhat is the essence of journalism if it doesn't benefit society?
p101
aa(lp102
VMy kind of journalism is a product
p103
aVof my society.
p104
aVI know that sometimes
p105
aVpeople have their own criticisms
p106
aVabout undercover journalism.
p107
aa(lp108
V(Video) Official: He brought out some money from his pockets
p109
aVand put it on the table,
p110
aVso that we should not be afraid.
p111
aVHe wants to bring the cocoa and send it to Cote d'Ivoire.
p112
aVSo with my hidden intention, I kept quiet.
p113
aVI didn't utter a word.
p114
aVBut my colleagues didn't know.
p115
aVSo after collecting the money,
p116
aVwhen he left, we were waiting for him to bring the goods.
p117
aVImmediately after he left, I told my colleagues that
p118
aVsince I was the leader of the group,
p119
aVI told my colleagues that if they come,
p120
aVwe will arrest them.
p121
aa(lp122
VSecond official: I don't even know the place called [unclear].
p123
aVI've never stepped there before.
p124
aVSo I'm surprised.
p125
aVYou see a hand counting money just in front of me.
p126
aVThe next moment, you see the money in my hands,
p127
aVcounting, whereas I have not come into contact with anybody.
p128
aVI have not done any business with anybody.
p129
aVReporter: When Metro News contacted investigative reporter
p130
aa(lp131
VAnas Aremeyaw Anas for his reaction,
p132
aVhe just smiled and gave this video extract
p133
aVhe did not use in the documentary recently shown onscreen.
p134
aVThe officer who earlier denied involvement
p135
aVpecks a calculator to compute the amount of money
p136
aVthey will charge on the cocoa to be smuggled.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnas Aremeyaw Anas: This was another story on anticorruption.
p139
aVAnd here was him, denying.
p140
aVBut you see, when you have the hard core evidence,
p141
aVyou are able to affect society.
p142
aVSometimes these are some of the headlines that come. (Music)

aV["Late Prof. John Evans Atta Mills: Former president of Ghana"]
p170
aa(lp171
VJohn Evans Atta Mills: What Anas says
p172
aVis not something which is unknown to many of us,
p173
aVbut please, those of you who are agents,
p174
aVand who are leading the customs officers into temptation,
p175
aVI'm telling you, Ghana is not going to say
p176
aVany good things to you about this.
p177
aa(lp178
VAAA: That was my president.
p179
aa(lp180
VI thought that I couldn't come here
p181
aVwithout giving you something special.
p182
aVI have a piece, and I'm excited that
p183
aVI'm sharing it for the first time with you here.
p184
aVI have been undercover in the prisons.
p185
aVI have been there for a long time.
p186
aVAnd I can tell you, what I saw is not nice.
p187
aVBut again, I can only affect society
p188
aVand affect government if I bring out the hard core evidence.
p189
aVMany times, the prison authorities have denied
p190
aVever having issues of drug abuse,
p191
aVissues of sodomy, so many issues they would deny
p192
aVthat it ever happens.
p193
aVHow can you obtain the hard core evidence?
p194
aa(lp195
VSo I was in the prison. ["Nsawan Prison"]
p196
aVNow, what you are seeing is a pile of dead bodies.
p197
aVNow, I happen to have followed one of my inmates,
p198
aVone of my friends, from his sick bed till death,
p199
aVand I can tell you it was not a nice thing at all.
p200
aVThere were issues of bad food being served
p201
aVas I recall that some of the food I ate
p202
aVis just not good for a human being.
p203
aVToilet facilities: very bad.
p204
aVI mean, you had to queue to get proper toilets to attend \u2014
p205
aVand that's what I call proper,
p206
aVwhen four of us are on a manhole.
p207
aVIt is something that if you narrate it to somebody,
p208
aVthe person wouldn't believe it.
p209
aVThe only way that you can let the person believe
p210
aVis when you show hard core evidence.
p211
aVOf course, drugs were abundant.
p212
aVIt was easier to get cannabis, heroin and cocaine,
p213
aVfaster even, in the prison than outside the prison.
p214
aa(lp215
VEvil in the society is an extreme disease.
p216
aVIf you have extreme diseases,
p217
aVyou need to get extreme remedies.
p218
aVMy kind of journalism might not fit in other continents
p219
aVor other countries,
p220
aVbut I can tell you, it works in my part of the continent
p221
aVof Africa, because usually, when people talk
p222
aVabout corruption, they ask, "Where is the evidence?
p223
aVShow me the evidence."
p224
aVI say, "This is the evidence."
p225
aVAnd that has aided in me putting a lot of people behind bars.
p226
aa(lp227
VYou see, we on the continent are able
p228
aVto tell the story better because we face the conditions
p229
aVand we see the conditions.
p230
aVThat is why I was particularly excited
p231
aVwhen we launched our "Africa Investigates" series
p232
aVwhere we investigated a lot of African countries.
p233
aVAs a result of the success of the "Africa Investigates" series,
p234
aVwe are moving on to World Investigates.
p235
aVBy the end of it, a lot more bad guys
p236
aVon our continent will be put behind bars.
p237
aa(lp238
VThis will not stop.
p239
aVI'm going to carry on with this kind of journalism,
p240
aVbecause I know that when evil men destroy,
p241
aVgood men must build and bind.
p242
aa(lp243
VThank you very much.
p244
aa(lp245
V(Applause)
p246
aa(lp247
VChris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.
p248
aVI have some questions for you.
p249
aVHow did you end up in jail? This was just a few weeks ago, I believe, yeah?
p250
aa(lp251
VAAA: Sure. You know, undercover is all about
p252
aVsetting the priorities right, so we got people
p253
aVto take me to court.
p254
aVSo I went through the very legal process,
p255
aVbecause at the end of the day, the prison authorities
p256
aVwant to check whether indeed you have been there or not,
p257
aVand that's how I got in there.
p258
aa(lp259
VCA: So someone sued you in court,
p260
aVand they took you there, and you were in remand custody
p261
aVfor part of it, and you did that deliberately.
p262
aa(lp263
VAAA: Yes, yes.
p264
aa(lp265
VCA: Talk to me just about fear
p266
aVand how you manage that,
p267
aVbecause you're regularly putting your life at risk.
p268
aVHow do you do that?
p269
aa(lp270
VAAA: You see, undercover is always a last resort.
p271
aVBefore we go undercover, we follow the rules.
p272
aVAnd I'm only comfortable and I'm purged of fear
p273
aVwhenever I am sure that all the steps
p274
aVhave been taken. I don't do it alone. I have a backup team
p275
aVwho help ensure that the safety and all the systems
p276
aVare put in place, but you've got to take
p277
aVvery intelligent decisions whenever they are happening.
p278
aVIf you don't, you will end up losing your life.
p279
aVSo yes, when the backup systems are put in place,
p280
aVI'm okay, I go in. Risky, yes,
p281
aVbut it's a hazard of a profession.
p282
aVI mean, everybody has their hazard.
p283
aVAnd once you say that is yours,
p284
aVyou've got to take it, as and when it comes.
p285
aa(lp286
VCA: Well, you're an amazing human and you've done amazing work
p287
aVand you've taught us a story
p288
aVlike no story I think any of us have heard before.
p289
aVAnd we're appreciative. We salute you. Thank you so much, Anas.
p290
aa(lp291
VAAA: Thank you.
p292
aa(lp293
VCA: Thank you. Stay safe. (Applause)

VI'm here today to show my photographs of the Lakota.
p5
aVMany of you may have heard of the Lakota,
p6
aVor at least the larger group of tribes,
p7
aVcalled the Sioux.
p8
aVThe Lakota are one of many tribes that were moved off their land
p9
aVto prisoner-of-war camps,
p10
aVnow called reservations.
p11
aVThe Pine Ridge Reservation,
p12
aVthe subject of today's slide show,
p13
aVis located about 75 miles southeast of the Black Hills in South Dakota.
p14
aVIt is sometimes referred to as Prisoner of War Camp Number 334,
p15
aVand it is where the Lakota now live.
p16
aVNow, if any of you have ever heard of AIM,
p17
aVthe American Indian Movement,
p18
aVor of Russell Means,
p19
aVor Leonard Peltier,
p20
aVor of the standoff at Oglala,
p21
aVthen you know Pine Ridge is ground zero for Native issues in the US.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo I've been asked to talk a little bit today
p24
aVabout my relationship with the Lakota,
p25
aVand that's a very difficult one for me,
p26
aVbecause, if you haven't noticed from my skin color,
p27
aVI'm white,
p28
aVand that is a huge barrier on a Native reservation.
p29
aVYou'll see a lot of people in my photographs today.
p30
aVI've become very close with them, and they've welcomed me like family.
p31
aVThey've called me "brother" and "uncle,"
p32
aVand invited me again and again over five years.
p33
aVBut on Pine Ridge,
p34
aVI will always be what is called "wasichu."
p35
aV"Wasichu" is a Lakota word
p36
aVthat means "non-Indian,"
p37
aVbut another version of this word
p38
aVmeans "the one who takes the best meat for himself."
p39
aVAnd that's what I want to focus on \u2014
p40
aVthe one who takes the best part of the meat.
p41
aVIt means "greedy."
p42
aa(lp43
VSo take a look around this auditorium today.
p44
aVWe are at a private school in the American West,
p45
aVsitting in red velvet chairs
p46
aVwith money in our pockets.
p47
aVAnd if we look at our lives,
p48
aVwe have indeed taken the best part of the meat.
p49
aVSo let's look today at a set of photographs
p50
aVof a people who lost
p51
aVso that we could gain,
p52
aVand know that when you see these people's faces,
p53
aVthat these are not just images of the Lakota;
p54
aVthey stand for all indigenous people.
p55
aa(lp56
VOn this piece of paper
p57
aVis the history the way I learned it from my Lakota friends and family.
p58
aVThe following is a time line of treaties made, treaties broken
p59
aVand massacres disguised as battles.
p60
aVI'll begin in 1824.
p61
aVWhat is known as the Bureau of Indian Affairs
p62
aVwas created within the War Department,
p63
aVsetting an early tone of aggression
p64
aVin our dealings with the Native Americans.
p65
aa(lp66
V1851:
p67
aVThe first treaty of Fort Laramie was made,
p68
aVclearly marking the boundaries of the Lakota Nation.
p69
aVAccording to the treaty, those lands are a sovereign nation.
p70
aVIf the boundaries of this treaty had held \u2014
p71
aVand there is a legal basis that they should \u2014
p72
aVthen this is what the US would look like today.
p73
aVTen years later.
p74
aVThe Homestead Act, signed by President Lincoln,
p75
aVunleashed a flood of white settlers into Native lands.
p76
aa(lp77
V1863:
p78
aVAn uprising of Santee Sioux in Minnesota
p79
aVends with the hanging of 38 Sioux men,
p80
aVthe largest mass execution in US history.
p81
aVThe execution was ordered by President Lincoln,
p82
aVonly two days after he signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
p83
aa(lp84
V1866: The beginning of the Transcontinental Railroad \u2014
p85
aVa new era.
p86
aVWe appropriated land for trails and trains
p87
aVto shortcut through the heart of the Lakota Nation.
p88
aVThe treaties were out the window.
p89
aVIn response, three tribes led by the Lakota chief Red Cloud
p90
aVattacked and defeated the US army,
p91
aVmany times over.
p92
aVI want to repeat that part:
p93
aVThe Lakota defeat the US army.
p94
aa(lp95
V1868: The second Fort Laramie Treaty clearly guarantees
p96
aVthe sovereignty of the Great Sioux Nation
p97
aVand the Lakotas' ownership of the sacred Black Hills.
p98
aVThe government also promises land and hunting rights
p99
aVin the surrounding states.
p100
aVWe promise that the Powder River country
p101
aVwill henceforth be closed to all whites.
p102
aVThe treaty seemed to be a complete victory
p103
aVfor Red Cloud and the Sioux.
p104
aVIn fact, this is the only war in American history
p105
aVin which the government negotiated a peace
p106
aVby conceding everything demanded by the enemy.
p107
aa(lp108
V1869: The Transcontinental Railroad was completed.
p109
aVIt began carrying, among other things, large numbers of hunters,
p110
aVwho began the wholesale killing of buffalo,
p111
aVeliminating a source of food, clothing and shelter for the Sioux.
p112
aa(lp113
V1871:
p114
aVThe Indian Appropriation Act
p115
aVmakes all Indians wards of the federal government.
p116
aVIn addition, the military issued orders
p117
aVforbidding western Indians from leaving reservations.
p118
aVAll western Indians at that point in time were now prisoners of war.
p119
aVAlso in 1871,
p120
aVwe ended the time of treaty-making.
p121
aVThe problem with treaties is they allow tribes to exist as sovereign nations,
p122
aVand we can't have that.
p123
aVWe had plans.
p124
aa(lp125
V1874:
p126
aVGeneral George Custer announced the discovery of gold in Lakota territory,
p127
aVspecifically the Black Hills.
p128
aVThe news of gold creates a massive influx of white settlers
p129
aVinto Lakota Nation.
p130
aVCuster recommends that Congress find a way
p131
aVto end the treaties with the Lakota as soon as possible.
p132
aa(lp133
V1875: The Lakota war begins
p134
aVover the violation of the Fort Laramie Treaty.
p135
aV1876:
p136
aVOn July 26th,
p137
aVon its way to attack a Lakota village,
p138
aVCuster's 7th Cavalry was crushed
p139
aVat the battle of Little Big Horn.
p140
aV1877:
p141
aVThe great Lakota warrior and chief named Crazy Horse
p142
aVsurrendered at Fort Robinson.
p143
aVHe was later killed while in custody.
p144
aV1877 is also the year we found a way to get around the Fort Laramie Treaties.
p145
aVA new agreement was presented to Sioux chiefs and their leading men,
p146
aVunder a campaign known as "Sell or Starve" \u2014
p147
aVsign the paper, or no food for your tribe.
p148
aVOnly 10 percent of the adult male population signed.
p149
aVThe Fort Laramie Treaty called for at least three-quarters of the tribe
p150
aVto sign away land.
p151
aVThat clause was obviously ignored.
p152
aa(lp153
V1887: The Dawes Act.
p154
aVCommunal ownership of reservation lands ends.
p155
aVReservations are cut up into 160-acre sections,
p156
aVand distributed to individual Indians
p157
aVwith the surplus disposed of.
p158
aVTribes lost millions of acres.
p159
aVThe American dream of individual land ownership
p160
aVturned out to be a very clever way
p161
aVto divide the reservation until nothing was left.
p162
aVThe move destroyed the reservations,
p163
aVmaking it easier to further subdivide and to sell
p164
aVwith every passing generation.
p165
aVMost of the surplus land
p166
aVand many of the plots within reservation boundaries
p167
aVare now in the hands of white ranchers.
p168
aVOnce again, the fat of the land goes to wasichu.
p169
aa(lp170
V1890: A date I believe to be the most important in this slide show.
p171
aVThis is the year of the Wounded Knee Massacre.
p172
aVOn December 29,
p173
aVUS troops surrounded a Sioux encampment at Wounded Knee Creek,
p174
aVand massacred Chief Big Foot and 300 prisoners of war,
p175
aVusing a new rapid-fire weapon that fired exploding shells,
p176
aVcalled a Hotchkiss gun.
p177
aVFor this so-called "battle,"
p178
aV20 Congressional Medals of Honor for Valor
p179
aVwere given to the 7th Cavalry.
p180
aVTo this day,
p181
aVthis is the most Medals of Honor ever awarded for a single battle.
p182
aVMore Medals of Honor were given
p183
aVfor the indiscriminate slaughter of women and children
p184
aVthan for any battle in World War One,
p185
aVWorld War Two,
p186
aVKorea, Vietnam,
p187
aVIraq or Afghanistan.
p188
aa(lp189
VThe Wounded Knee Massacre is considered the end of the Indian wars.
p190
aVWhenever I visit the site of the mass grave at Wounded Knee,
p191
aVI see it not just as a grave for the Lakota or for the Sioux,
p192
aVbut as a grave for all indigenous peoples.
p193
aVThe holy man Black Elk, said,
p194
aV"I did not know then how much was ended.
p195
aVWhen I look back now from this high hill of my old age,
p196
aVI can still see the butchered women and children
p197
aVlying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch,
p198
aVas plain as when I saw them
p199
aVwith eyes still young.
p200
aVAnd I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud
p201
aVand was buried in the blizzard.
p202
aVA people's dream died there.
p203
aVAnd it was a beautiful dream."
p204
aa(lp205
VWith this event,
p206
aVa new era in Native American history began.
p207
aVEverything can be measured before Wounded Knee and after,
p208
aVbecause it was in this moment,
p209
aVwith the fingers on the triggers of the Hotchkiss guns,
p210
aVthat the US government openly declared its position on Native rights.
p211
aVThey were tired of treaties.
p212
aVThey were tired of sacred hills.
p213
aVThey were tired of ghost dances.
p214
aVAnd they were tired of all the inconveniences of the Sioux.
p215
aVSo they brought out their cannons.
p216
aV"You want to be an Indian now?" they said,
p217
aVfinger on the trigger.
p218
aa(lp219
V1900:
p220
aVthe US Indian population reached its low point \u2014
p221
aVless than 250,000,
p222
aVcompared to an estimated eight million in 1492.
p223
aa(lp224
VFast-forward.
p225
aV1980:
p226
aVThe longest-running court case in US history,
p227
aVthe Sioux Nation versus the United States,
p228
aVwas ruled upon by the US Supreme Court.
p229
aVThe court determined that when the Sioux were resettled onto reservations
p230
aVand seven million acres of their land were opened up
p231
aVto prospectors and homesteaders,
p232
aVthe terms of the second Fort Laramie Treaty
p233
aVhad been violated.
p234
aVThe court stated that the Black Hills were illegally taken,
p235
aVand that the initial offering price, plus interest,
p236
aVshould be paid to the Sioux Nation.
p237
aVAs payment for the Black Hills,
p238
aVthe court awarded only 106 million dollars to the Sioux Nation.
p239
aVThe Sioux refused the money with the rallying cry,
p240
aV"The Black Hills are not for sale."
p241
aa(lp242
V2010:
p243
aVStatistics about Native population today,
p244
aVmore than a century after the massacre at Wounded Knee,
p245
aVreveal the legacy of colonization,
p246
aVforced migration
p247
aVand treaty violations.
p248
aVUnemployment on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation
p249
aVfluctuates between 85 and 90 percent.
p250
aVThe housing office is unable to build new structures,
p251
aVand existing structures are falling apart.
p252
aVMany are homeless,
p253
aVand those with homes are packed into rotting buildings
p254
aVwith up to five families.
p255
aVThirty-nine percent of homes on Pine Ridge
p256
aVhave no electricity.
p257
aVAt least 60 percent of the homes on the reservation
p258
aVare infested with black mold.
p259
aVMore than 90 percent of the population lives below the federal poverty line.
p260
aVThe tuberculosis rate on Pine Ridge
p261
aVis approximately eight times higher than the US national average.
p262
aVThe infant mortality rate is the highest on this continent,
p263
aVand is about three times higher than the US national average.
p264
aVCervical cancer is five times higher
p265
aVthan the US national average.
p266
aVThe school dropout rate is up to 70 percent.
p267
aVTeacher turnover is eight times higher than the US national average.
p268
aVFrequently, grandparents are raising their grandchildren
p269
aVbecause parents, due to alcoholism,
p270
aVdomestic violence and general apathy,
p271
aVcannot raise them.
p272
aVFifty percent of the population over the age of 40
p273
aVsuffers from diabetes.
p274
aVThe life expectancy for men is between 46 and 48 years old \u2014
p275
aVroughly the same as in Afghanistan and Somalia.
p276
aa(lp277
VThe last chapter in any successful genocide
p278
aVis the one in which the oppressor
p279
aVcan remove their hands and say,
p280
aV"My god \u2014 what are these people doing to themselves?
p281
aVThey're killing each other.
p282
aVThey're killing themselves
p283
aVwhile we watch them die."
p284
aVThis is how we came to own these United States.
p285
aVThis is the legacy
p286
aVof Manifest Destiny.
p287
aVPrisoners are still born into prisoner of war camps,
p288
aVlong after the guards are gone.
p289
aVThese are the bones left after the best meat has been taken.
p290
aa(lp291
VA long time ago,
p292
aVa series of events was set in motion
p293
aVby a people who look like me, by wasichu,
p294
aVeager to take the land and the water and the gold in the hills.
p295
aVThose events led to a domino effect that has yet to end.
p296
aa(lp297
VAs removed as we, the dominant society, may feel
p298
aVfrom a massacre in 1890,
p299
aVor a series of broken treaties 150 years ago,
p300
aVI still have to ask you the question:
p301
aVHow should you feel about the statistics of today?
p302
aVWhat is the connection between these images of suffering
p303
aVand the history that I just read to you?
p304
aVAnd how much of this history do you need to own, even?
p305
aVIs any of this your responsibility today?
p306
aVI have been told that there must be something we can do.
p307
aVThere must be some call to action.
p308
aVBecause for so long, I've been standing on the sidelines,
p309
aVcontent to be a witness,
p310
aVjust taking photographs.
p311
aVBecause the solutions seem so far in the past,
p312
aVI needed nothing short of a time machine to access them.
p313
aa(lp314
VThe suffering of indigenous peoples is not a simple issue to fix.
p315
aVIt's not something everyone can get behind
p316
aVthe way they get behind helping Haiti,
p317
aVor ending AIDS, or fighting a famine.
p318
aVThe "fix," as it's called,
p319
aVmay be much more difficult for the dominant society
p320
aVthan, say, a $50 check
p321
aVor a church trip to paint some graffiti-covered houses,
p322
aVor a suburban family
p323
aVdonating a box of clothes they don't even want anymore.
p324
aVSo where does that leave us?
p325
aVShrugging our shoulders in the dark?
p326
aa(lp327
VThe United States continues on a daily basis to violate the terms
p328
aVof the 1851 and 1868 Fort Laramie Treaties with the Lakota.
p329
aVThe call to action I offer today \u2014
p330
aVmy TED wish \u2014 is this:
p331
aVHonor the treaties.
p332
aVGive back the Black Hills.
p333
aVIt's not your business what they do with them.

VI believe that there are new, hidden tensions
p5
aVthat are actually happening between people and institutions \u2014
p6
aVinstitutions that are the institutions that people
p7
aVinhabit in their daily life:
p8
aVschools, hospitals, workplaces,
p9
aVfactories, offices, etc.
p10
aa(lp11
VAnd something that I see happening
p12
aVis something that I would like to call
p13
aVa sort of "democratization of intimacy."
p14
aVAnd what do I mean by that?
p15
aVI mean that what people are doing
p16
aVis, in fact, they are sort of, with their communication channels,
p17
aVthey are breaking an imposed isolation
p18
aVthat these institutions are imposing on them.
p19
aa(lp20
VHow are they doing this? They're doing it
p21
aVin a very simple way, by calling their mom from work,
p22
aVby IMing from their office to their friends,
p23
aVby texting under the desk.
p24
aVThe pictures that you're seeing behind me
p25
aVare people that I visited in the last few months.
p26
aVAnd I asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most.
p27
aVAnd somebody brought a boyfriend, somebody a father.
p28
aVOne young woman brought her grandfather.
p29
aVFor 20 years, I've been looking at how people use
p30
aVchannels such as email, the mobile phone, texting, etc.
p31
aVWhat we're actually going to see is that, fundamentally,
p32
aVpeople are communicating on a regular basis
p33
aVwith five, six, seven of their most intimate sphere.
p34
aa(lp35
VNow, lets take some data. Facebook.
p36
aVRecently some sociologists from Facebook \u2014
p37
aVFacebook is the channel that you would expect
p38
aVis the most enlargening of all channels.
p39
aVAnd an average user,
p40
aVsaid Cameron Marlow,
p41
aVfrom Facebook, has about 120 friends.
p42
aVBut he actually talks to,
p43
aVhas two-way exchanges with, about four to six people
p44
aVon a regular base, depending on his gender.
p45
aVAcademic research on instant messaging
p46
aValso shows 100 people on buddy lists,
p47
aVbut fundamentally people chat with two, three, four \u2014
p48
aVanyway, less than five.
p49
aVMy own research on cellphones and voice calls
p50
aVshows that 80 percent of the calls
p51
aVare actually made to four people. 80 percent.
p52
aVAnd when you go to Skype, it's down to two people.
p53
aVA lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed.
p54
aVI mean, I've been a bit disappointed sometimes
p55
aVwhen I saw this data and all this deployment, just for five people.
p56
aVAnd some sociologists actually feel that
p57
aVit's a closure, it's a cocooning,
p58
aVthat we're disengaging from the public.
p59
aVAnd I would actually, I would like to show you that
p60
aVif we actually look at who is doing it,
p61
aVand from where they're doing it,
p62
aVactually there is an incredible social transformation.
p63
aa(lp64
VThere are three stories that I think are quite good examples.
p65
aVThe first gentleman, he's a baker.
p66
aVAnd so he starts working every morning at four o'clock in the morning.
p67
aVAnd around eight o'clock he sort of sneaks away from his oven,
p68
aVcleans his hands from the flour
p69
aVand calls his wife.
p70
aVHe just wants to wish her a good day, because that's the start of her day.
p71
aVAnd I've heard this story a number of times.
p72
aVA young factory worker who works night shifts,
p73
aVwho manages to sneak away from the factory floor,
p74
aVwhere there is CCTV by the way,
p75
aVand find a corner, where at 11 o'clock at night
p76
aVhe can call his girlfriend and just say goodnight.
p77
aVOr a mother who, at four o'clock,
p78
aVsuddenly manages to find a corner in the toilet
p79
aVto check that her children are safely home.
p80
aa(lp81
VThen there is another couple, there is a Brazilian couple.
p82
aVThey've lived in Italy for a number of years.
p83
aVThey Skype with their families a few times a week.
p84
aVBut once a fortnight, they actually put the computer on their dining table,
p85
aVpull out the webcam and actually have dinner
p86
aVwith their family in Sao Paulo. And they have a big event of it.
p87
aVAnd I heard this story the first time a couple of years ago
p88
aVfrom a very modest family
p89
aVof immigrants from Kosovo in Switzerland.
p90
aVThey had set up a big screen in their living room,
p91
aVand every morning they had breakfast with their grandmother.
p92
aVBut Danny Miller, who is a very good anthropologist
p93
aVwho is working on Filipina migrant women
p94
aVwho leave their children back in the Philippines,
p95
aVwas telling me about how much parenting is going on
p96
aVthrough Skype,
p97
aVand how much these mothers are engaged with their children through Skype.
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd then there is the third couple. They are two friends.
p100
aVThey chat to each other every day, a few times a day actually.
p101
aVAnd finally, finally, they've managed to put
p102
aVinstant messaging on their computers at work.
p103
aVAnd now, obviously, they have it open.
p104
aVWhenever they have a moment they chat to each other.
p105
aVAnd this is exactly what we've been seeing
p106
aVwith teenagers and kids doing it in school, under the table,
p107
aVand texting under the table to their friends.
p108
aVSo, none of these cases are unique.
p109
aVI mean, I could tell you hundreds of them.
p110
aa(lp111
VBut what is really exceptional is the setting.
p112
aVSo, think of the three settings I've talked to you about:
p113
aVfactory, migration, office.
p114
aVBut it could be in a school, it could be an administration,
p115
aVit could be a hospital.
p116
aVThree settings that, if we just step back 15 years,
p117
aVif you just think back 15 years,
p118
aVwhen you clocked in,
p119
aVwhen you clocked in to an office,
p120
aVwhen you clocked in to a factory,
p121
aVthere was no contact for the whole duration of the time,
p122
aVthere was no contact with your private sphere.
p123
aVIf you were lucky there was a public phone hanging in the corridor or somewhere.
p124
aVIf you were in management, oh, that was a different story.
p125
aVMaybe you had a direct line.
p126
aVIf you were not, you maybe had to go through an operator.
p127
aVBut basically, when you walked into those buildings,
p128
aVthe private sphere was left behind you.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd this has become such a norm of our professional lives,
p131
aVsuch a norm and such an expectation.
p132
aVAnd it had nothing to do with technical capability.
p133
aVThe phones were there. But the expectation was once you moved in there
p134
aVyour commitment was fully to the task at hand,
p135
aVfully to the people around you.
p136
aVThat was where the focus had to be.
p137
aVAnd this has become such a cultural norm
p138
aVthat we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this cleavage.
p139
aVIf you think nursery, kindergarten, first years of school
p140
aVare just dedicated to take away the children,
p141
aVto make them used to staying long hours away from their family.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd then the school enacts perfectly well.
p144
aVIt mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will find in offices:
p145
aVrituals of entry, rituals of exit,
p146
aVthe schedules, the uniforms in this country,
p147
aVthings that identify you, team-building activities,
p148
aVteam building that will allow you to basically
p149
aVbe with a random group of kids, or a random group of people
p150
aVthat you will have to be with for a number of time.
p151
aVAnd of course, the major thing:
p152
aVlearn to pay attention,
p153
aVto concentrate and focus your attention.
p154
aVThis only started about 150 years ago.
p155
aVIt only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy,
p156
aVand of industrial revolution.
p157
aVWhen people basically had to go somewhere else to work
p158
aVand carry out the work.
p159
aVAnd when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach,
p160
aVwhere there was a clear distinction between the private sphere
p161
aVand the public sphere.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo, until then, basically people were living on top of their trades.
p164
aVThey were living on top of the land they were laboring.
p165
aVThey were living on top of the workshops where they were working.
p166
aVAnd if you think, it's permeated our whole culture,
p167
aVeven our cities.
p168
aVIf you think of medieval cities, medieval cities the boroughs
p169
aVall have the names of the guilds and professions that lived there.
p170
aVNow we have sprawling residential suburbias
p171
aVthat are well distinct from production areas
p172
aVand commercial areas.
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd actually, over these 150 years,
p175
aVthere has been a very clear class system that also has emerged.
p176
aVSo the lower the status of the job
p177
aVand of the person carrying out, the more removed
p178
aVhe would be from his personal sphere.
p179
aVPeople have taken this amazing possibility
p180
aVof actually being in contact all through the day
p181
aVor in all types of situations.
p182
aVAnd they are doing it massively.
p183
aVThe Pew Institute, which produces good data
p184
aVon a regular basis on, for instance, in the States,
p185
aVsays that \u2014 and I think that this number is conservative \u2014
p186
aV50 percent of anybody with email access at work
p187
aVis actually doing private email from his office.
p188
aVI really think that the number is conservative.
p189
aVIn my own research, we saw that the peak for private email
p190
aVis actually 11 o'clock in the morning, whatever the country.
p191
aV75 percent of people admit doing private
p192
aVconversations from work on their mobile phones.
p193
aV100 percent are using text.
p194
aa(lp195
VThe point is that this re-appropriation of the personal sphere
p196
aVis not terribly successful with all institutions.
p197
aVI'm always surprised the U.S. Army
p198
aVsociologists are discussing of the impact
p199
aVfor instance, of soldiers in Iraq
p200
aVhaving daily contact with their families.
p201
aVBut there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access.
p202
aVAnd every day, every single day,
p203
aVI read news that makes me cringe,
p204
aVlike a $15 fine
p205
aVto kids in Texas,
p206
aVfor using, every time they take out their mobile phone in school.
p207
aVImmediate dismissal to bus drivers in New York,
p208
aVif seen with a mobile phone in a hand.
p209
aVCompanies blocking access to IM or to Facebook.
p210
aa(lp211
VBehind issues of security and safety,
p212
aVwhich have always been the arguments for social control,
p213
aVin fact what is going on is that
p214
aVthese institutions are trying to decide
p215
aVwho, in fact, has a right to self determine their attention,
p216
aVto decide, whether they should, or not, be isolated.
p217
aVAnd they are actually trying to block, in a certain sense,
p218
aVthis movement of a greater possibility of intimacy.

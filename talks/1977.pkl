VType is something we consume
p5
aVin enormous quantities.
p6
aVIn much of the world,
p7
aVit's completely inescapable.
p8
aVBut few consumers are concerned to know
p9
aVwhere a particular typeface came from
p10
aVor when or who designed it,
p11
aVif, indeed, there was any human agency involved
p12
aVin its creation, if it didn't just sort of materialize
p13
aVout of the software ether.
p14
aa(lp15
VBut I do have to be concerned with those things.
p16
aVIt's my job.
p17
aVI'm one of the tiny handful of people
p18
aVwho gets badly bent out of shape
p19
aVby the bad spacing of the T and the E
p20
aVthat you see there.
p21
aVI've got to take that slide off.
p22
aVI can't stand it. Nor can Chris.
p23
aVThere. Good.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo my talk is about the connection
p26
aVbetween technology and design of type.
p27
aVThe technology has changed
p28
aVa number of times since I started work:
p29
aVphoto, digital, desktop, screen, web.
p30
aVI've had to survive those changes and try
p31
aVto understand their implications for what I do
p32
aVfor design.
p33
aVThis slide is about the effect of tools on form.
p34
aVThe two letters, the two K's,
p35
aVthe one on your left, my right, is modern,
p36
aVmade on a computer.
p37
aVAll straight lines are dead straight.
p38
aVThe curves have that kind of mathematical smoothness
p39
aVthat the Bézier formula imposes.
p40
aVOn the right, ancient Gothic,
p41
aVcut in the resistant material of steel by hand.
p42
aVNone of the straight lines are actually straight.
p43
aVThe curves are kind of subtle.
p44
aVIt has that spark of life from the human hand
p45
aVthat the machine or the program
p46
aVcan never capture.
p47
aVWhat a contrast.
p48
aa(lp49
VWell, I tell a lie.
p50
aVA lie at TED. I'm really sorry.
p51
aVBoth of these were made on a computer,
p52
aVsame software, same Bézier curves,
p53
aVsame font format.
p54
aVThe one on your left
p55
aVwas made by Zuzana Licko at Emigre,
p56
aVand I did the other one.
p57
aVThe tool is the same, yet the letters are different.
p58
aVThe letters are different
p59
aVbecause the designers are different.
p60
aVThat's all. Zuzana wanted hers to look like that.
p61
aVI wanted mine to look like that. End of story.
p62
aVType is very adaptable.
p63
aVUnlike a fine art, such as sculpture or architecture,
p64
aVtype hides its methods.
p65
aVI think of myself as an industrial designer.
p66
aVThe thing I design is manufactured,
p67
aVand it has a function:
p68
aVto be read, to convey meaning.
p69
aVBut there is a bit more to it than that.
p70
aVThere's the sort of aesthetic element.
p71
aVWhat makes these two letters different
p72
aVfrom different interpretations by different designers?
p73
aVWhat gives the work of some designers
p74
aVsort of characteristic personal style,
p75
aVas you might find in the work of a fashion designer,
p76
aVan automobile designer, whatever?
p77
aa(lp78
VThere have been some cases, I admit,
p79
aVwhere I as a designer
p80
aVdid feel the influence of technology.
p81
aVThis is from the mid-'60s,
p82
aVthe change from metal type to photo,
p83
aVhot to cold.
p84
aVThis brought some benefits
p85
aVbut also one particular drawback:
p86
aVa spacing system that only provided
p87
aV18 discrete units for letters
p88
aVto be accommodated on.
p89
aVI was asked at this time to design
p90
aVa series of condensed sans serif types
p91
aVwith as many different variants as possible
p92
aVwithin this 18-unit box.
p93
aVQuickly looking at the arithmetic,
p94
aVI realized I could only actually make three
p95
aVof related design. Here you see them.
p96
aVIn Helvetica Compressed, Extra Compressed,
p97
aVand Ultra Compressed, this rigid 18-unit system
p98
aVreally boxed me in.
p99
aVIt kind of determined the proportions
p100
aVof the design.
p101
aVHere are the typefaces, at least the lower cases.
p102
aVSo do you look at these and say,
p103
aV"Poor Matthew, he had to submit to a problem,
p104
aVand by God it shows in the results."
p105
aVI hope not.
p106
aVIf I were doing this same job today,
p107
aVinstead of having 18 spacing units,
p108
aVI would have 1,000.
p109
aVClearly I could make more variants,
p110
aVbut would these three members of the family be better?
p111
aVIt's hard to say without actually doing it,
p112
aVbut they would not be better in the proportion
p113
aVof 1,000 to 18, I can tell you that.
p114
aVMy instinct tells you that any improvement
p115
aVwould be rather slight, because they were designed
p116
aVas functions of the system they were designed to fit,
p117
aVand as I said, type is very adaptable.
p118
aVIt does hide its methods.
p119
aVAll industrial designers work within constraints.
p120
aVThis is not fine art.
p121
aa(lp122
VThe question is, does a constraint
p123
aVforce a compromise?
p124
aVBy accepting a constraint,
p125
aVare you working to a lower standard?
p126
aVI don't believe so, and I've always been encouraged
p127
aVby something that Charles Eames said.
p128
aVHe said he was conscious of working
p129
aVwithin constraints,
p130
aVbut not of making compromises.
p131
aVThe distinction between a constraint
p132
aVand a compromise is obviously very subtle,
p133
aVbut it's very central to my attitude to work.
p134
aa(lp135
VRemember this reading experience?
p136
aVThe phone book. I'll hold the slide
p137
aVso you can enjoy the nostalgia.
p138
aVThis is from the mid-'70s early trials
p139
aVof Bell Centennial typeface I designed
p140
aVfor the U.S. phone books,
p141
aVand it was my first experience of digital type,
p142
aVand quite a baptism.
p143
aVDesigned for the phone books, as I said,
p144
aVto be printed at tiny size on newsprint
p145
aVon very high-speed rotary presses
p146
aVwith ink that was kerosene and lampblack.
p147
aVThis is not a hospitable environment
p148
aVfor a typographic designer.
p149
aVSo the challenge for me was to design type
p150
aVthat performed as well as possible
p151
aVin these very adverse production conditions.
p152
aVAs I say, we were in the infancy of digital type.
p153
aVI had to draw every character by hand
p154
aVon quadrille graph paper \u2014
p155
aVthere were four weights of Bell Centennial \u2014
p156
aVpixel by pixel, then encode them raster line by raster line
p157
aVfor the keyboard.
p158
aVIt took two years, but I learned a lot.
p159
aVThese letters look as though they've been chewed
p160
aVby the dog or something or other,
p161
aVbut the missing pixels at the intersections
p162
aVof strokes or in the crotches
p163
aVare the result of my studying the effects
p164
aVof ink spread on cheap paper
p165
aVand reacting, revising the font accordingly.
p166
aVThese strange artifacts are designed to compensate
p167
aVfor the undesirable effects of scale
p168
aVand production process.
p169
aVAt the outset, AT&T had wanted
p170
aVto set the phone books in Helvetica,
p171
aVbut as my friend Erik Spiekermann said
p172
aVin the Helvetica movie, if you've seen that,
p173
aVthe letters in Helvetica were designed to be
p174
aVas similar to one another as possible.
p175
aVThis is not the recipe for legibility at small size.
p176
aVIt looks very elegant up on a slide.
p177
aVI had to disambiguate these forms
p178
aVof the figures as much as possible in Bell Centennial
p179
aVby sort of opening the shapes up, as you can see
p180
aVin the bottom part of that slide.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo now we're on to the mid-'80s,
p183
aVthe early days of digital outline fonts,
p184
aVvector technology.
p185
aVThere was an issue at that time
p186
aVwith the size of the fonts,
p187
aVthe amount of data that was required to find
p188
aVand store a font in computer memory.
p189
aVIt limited the number of fonts you could get
p190
aVon your typesetting system at any one time.
p191
aVI did an analysis of the data,
p192
aVand found that a typical serif face
p193
aVyou see on the left
p194
aVneeded nearly twice as much data
p195
aVas a sans serif in the middle
p196
aVbecause of all the points required
p197
aVto define the elegantly curved serif brackets.
p198
aVThe numbers at the bottom of the slide, by the way,
p199
aVthey represent the amount of data
p200
aVneeded to store each of the fonts.
p201
aVSo the sans serif, in the middle,
p202
aVsans the serifs, was much more economical,
p203
aV81 to 151.
p204
aa(lp205
V"Aha," I thought. "The engineers have a problem.
p206
aVDesigner to the rescue."
p207
aa(lp208
VI made a serif type, you can see it on the right,
p209
aVwithout curved serifs.
p210
aVI made them polygonal, out of straight line segments,
p211
aVchamfered brackets.
p212
aVAnd look, as economical in data as a sans serif.
p213
aVWe call it Charter, on the right.
p214
aa(lp215
VSo I went to the head of engineering
p216
aVwith my numbers, and I said proudly,
p217
aV"I have solved your problem."
p218
aa(lp219
V"Oh," he said. "What problem?"
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd I said, "Well, you know, the problem
p222
aVof the huge data you require for serif fonts and so on."
p223
aa(lp224
V"Oh," he said. "We solved that problem last week.
p225
aVWe wrote a compaction routine that reduces
p226
aVthe size of all fonts by an order of magnitude.
p227
aVYou can have as many fonts on your system
p228
aVas you like."
p229
aa(lp230
V"Well, thank you for letting me know," I said.
p231
aa(lp232
VFoiled again.
p233
aVI was left with a design solution
p234
aVfor a nonexistent technical problem.
p235
aa(lp236
VBut here is where the story sort of gets interesting for me.
p237
aVI didn't just throw my design away
p238
aVin a fit of pique.
p239
aVI persevered.
p240
aVWhat had started as a technical exercise
p241
aVbecame an aesthetic exercise, really.
p242
aVIn other words, I had come to like this typeface.
p243
aVForget its origins. Screw that.
p244
aVI liked the design for its own sake.
p245
aVThe simplified forms of Charter
p246
aVgave it a sort of plain-spoken quality
p247
aVand unfussy spareness
p248
aVthat sort of pleased me.
p249
aVYou know, at times of technical innovation,
p250
aVdesigners want to be influenced
p251
aVby what's in the air.
p252
aVWe want to respond. We want to be pushed
p253
aVinto exploring something new.
p254
aVSo Charter is a sort of parable for me, really.
p255
aVIn the end, there was no hard and fast causal link
p256
aVbetween the technology and the design of Charter.
p257
aVI had really misunderstood the technology.
p258
aVThe technology did suggest something to me,
p259
aVbut it did not force my hand,
p260
aVand I think this happens very often.
p261
aa(lp262
VYou know, engineers are very smart,
p263
aVand despite occasional frustrations
p264
aVbecause I'm less smart,
p265
aVI've always enjoyed working with them
p266
aVand learning from them.
p267
aVApropos, in the mid-'90s,
p268
aVI started talking to Microsoft
p269
aVabout screen fonts.
p270
aVUp to that point, all the fonts on screen
p271
aVhad been adapted from previously existing
p272
aVprinting fonts, of course.
p273
aVBut Microsoft foresaw correctly
p274
aVthe movement, the stampede
p275
aVtowards electronic communication,
p276
aVto reading and writing onscreen
p277
aVwith the printed output as being sort of secondary
p278
aVin importance.
p279
aa(lp280
VSo the priorities were just tipping at that point.
p281
aVThey wanted a small core set of fonts
p282
aVthat were not adapted but designed for the screen
p283
aVto face up to the problems of screen,
p284
aVwhich were their coarse resolution displays.
p285
aVI said to Microsoft, a typeface designed
p286
aVfor a particular technology
p287
aVis a self-obsoleting typeface.
p288
aVI've designed too many faces in the past
p289
aVthat were intended to mitigate technical problems.
p290
aVThanks to the engineers, the technical problems went away.
p291
aVSo did my typeface.
p292
aVIt was only a stopgap.
p293
aVMicrosoft came back to say that
p294
aVaffordable computer monitors
p295
aVwith better resolutions
p296
aVwere at least a decade away.
p297
aVSo I thought, well, a decade, that's not bad,
p298
aVthat's more than a stopgap.
p299
aa(lp300
VSo I was persuaded, I was convinced,
p301
aVand we went to work on what became Verdana
p302
aVand Georgia,
p303
aVfor the first time working not on paper
p304
aVbut directly onto the screen from the pixel up.
p305
aVAt that time, screens were binary.
p306
aVThe pixel was either on or it was off.
p307
aVHere you see the outline of a letter,
p308
aVthe cap H,
p309
aVwhich is the thin black line, the contour,
p310
aVwhich is how it is stored in memory,
p311
aVsuperimposed on the bitmap,
p312
aVwhich is the grey area,
p313
aVwhich is how it's displayed on the screen.
p314
aVThe bitmap is rasterized from the outline.
p315
aVHere in a cap H, which is all straight lines,
p316
aVthe two are in almost perfect sync
p317
aVon the Cartesian grid.
p318
aVNot so with an O.
p319
aVThis looks more like bricklaying than type design,
p320
aVbut believe me, this is a good bitmap O,
p321
aVfor the simple reason that it's symmetrical
p322
aVin both x and y axes.
p323
aVIn a binary bitmap, you actually can't ask
p324
aVfor more than that.
p325
aVI would sometimes make, I don't know,
p326
aVthree or four different versions of a difficult letter
p327
aVlike a lowercase A,
p328
aVand then stand back to choose which was the best.
p329
aVWell, there was no best,
p330
aVso the designer's judgment comes in
p331
aVin trying to decide
p332
aVwhich is the least bad.
p333
aVIs that a compromise?
p334
aVNot to me, if you are working
p335
aVat the highest standard the technology will allow,
p336
aValthough that standard may be
p337
aVwell short of the ideal.
p338
aVYou may be able to see on this slide
p339
aVtwo different bitmap fonts there.
p340
aVThe "a" in the upper one, I think,
p341
aVis better than the "a" in the lower one,
p342
aVbut it still ain't great.
p343
aVYou can maybe see the effect better
p344
aVif it's reduced. Well, maybe not.
p345
aa(lp346
VSo I'm a pragmatist, not an idealist,
p347
aVout of necessity.
p348
aVFor a certain kind of temperament,
p349
aVthere is a certain kind of satisfaction
p350
aVin doing something that cannot be perfect
p351
aVbut can still be done to the best of your ability.
p352
aVHere's the lowercase H from Georgia Italic.
p353
aVThe bitmap looks jagged and rough.
p354
aVIt is jagged and rough.
p355
aVBut I discovered, by experiment,
p356
aVthat there is an optimum slant
p357
aVfor an italic on a screen
p358
aVso the strokes break well
p359
aVat the pixel boundaries.
p360
aVLook in this example how, rough as it is,
p361
aVhow the left and right legs
p362
aVactually break at the same level.
p363
aVThat's a victory. That's good, right there.
p364
aVAnd of course, at the lower depths,
p365
aVyou don't get much choice.
p366
aVThis is an S, in case you were wondering.
p367
aa(lp368
VWell, it's been 18 years now
p369
aVsince Verdana and Georgia were released.
p370
aVMicrosoft were absolutely right,
p371
aVit took a good 10 years,
p372
aVbut screen displays now do have
p373
aVimproved spatial resolution,
p374
aVand very much improved photometric resolution
p375
aVthanks to anti-aliasing and so on.
p376
aVSo now that their mission is accomplished,
p377
aVhas that meant the demise
p378
aVof the screen fonts that I designed
p379
aVfor coarser displays back then?
p380
aVWill they outlive the now-obsolete screens
p381
aVand the flood of new web fonts
p382
aVcoming on to the market?
p383
aVOr have they established their own
p384
aVsort of evolutionary niche
p385
aVthat is independent of technology?
p386
aVIn other words, have they been absorbed
p387
aVinto the typographic mainstream?
p388
aVI'm not sure, but they've had a good run so far.
p389
aVHey, 18 is a good age for anything
p390
aVwith present-day rates of attrition,
p391
aVso I'm not complaining.
p392
aa(lp393
VThank you.

VHi. My name is Marwa, and I'm an architect.
p5
aVI was born and raised in Homs,
p6
aVa city in the central western part of Syria,
p7
aVand I've always lived here.
p8
aVAfter six years of war,
p9
aVHoms is now a half-destroyed city.
p10
aVMy family and I were lucky; our place is still standing.
p11
aVAlthough for two years, we were like prisoners at home.
p12
aVOutside there were demonstrations and battles and bombings and snipers.
p13
aVMy husband and I used to run an architecture studio
p14
aVin the old town main square.
p15
aVIt's gone, as is most of the old town itself.
p16
aVHalf of the city's other neighborhoods
p17
aVare now rubble.
p18
aVSince the ceasefire in late 2015,
p19
aVlarge parts of Homs have been more or less quiet.
p20
aVThe economy is completely broken, and people are still fighting.
p21
aVThe merchants who had stalls in the old city market
p22
aVnow trade out of sheds on the streets.
p23
aVUnder our apartment, there is a carpenter,
p24
aVsweetshops, a butcher, a printing house, workshops, among many more.
p25
aVI have started teaching part-time,
p26
aVand with my husband, who juggles several jobs,
p27
aVwe've opened a small bookshop.
p28
aVOther people do all sorts of jobs to get by.
p29
aa(lp30
VWhen I look at my destroyed city, of course, I ask myself:
p31
aVWhat has led to this senseless war?
p32
aVSyria was largely a place of tolerance,
p33
aVhistorically accustomed to variety,
p34
aVaccommodating a wide range of beliefs, origins, customs,
p35
aVgoods, food.
p36
aVHow did my country \u2014
p37
aVa country with communities living harmoniously together
p38
aVand comfortable in discussing their differences \u2014
p39
aVhow did it degenerate into civil war, violence, displacement
p40
aVand unprecedented sectarian hatred?
p41
aVThere were many reasons that had led to the war \u2014
p42
aVsocial, political and economic.
p43
aVThey all have played their role.
p44
aVBut I believe there is one key reason that has been overlooked
p45
aVand which is important to analyze,
p46
aVbecause from it will largely depend
p47
aVwhether we can make sure that this doesn't happen again.
p48
aVAnd that reason is architecture.
p49
aa(lp50
VArchitecture in my country has played an important role
p51
aVin creating, directing and amplifying conflict between warring factions,
p52
aVand this is probably true for other countries as well.
p53
aVThere is a sure correspondence between the architecture of a place
p54
aVand the character of the community that has settled there.
p55
aVArchitecture plays a key role in whether a community crumbles
p56
aVor comes together.
p57
aVSyrian society has long lived the coexistence
p58
aVof different traditions and backgrounds.
p59
aVSyrians have experienced the prosperity of open trade
p60
aVand sustainable communities.
p61
aVThey have enjoyed the true meaning of belonging to a place,
p62
aVand that was reflected in their built environment,
p63
aVin the mosques and churches built back-to-back,
p64
aVin the interwoven souks and public venues,
p65
aVand the proportions and sizes based on principles of humanity and harmony.
p66
aa(lp67
VThis architecture of mixity can still be read in the remains.
p68
aVThe old Islamic city in Syria was built over a multilayered past,
p69
aVintegrating with it and embracing its spirit.
p70
aVSo did its communities.
p71
aVPeople lived and worked with each other
p72
aVin a place that gave them a sense of belonging
p73
aVand made them feel at home.
p74
aVThey shared a remarkably unified existence.
p75
aa(lp76
VBut over the last century,
p77
aVgradually this delicate balance of these places has been interfered with;
p78
aVfirst, by the urban planners of the colonial period,
p79
aVwhen the French went enthusiastically about,
p80
aVtransforming what they saw as the un-modern Syrian cities.
p81
aVThey blew up city streets and relocated monuments.
p82
aVThey called them improvements,
p83
aVand they were the beginning of a long, slow unraveling.
p84
aVThe traditional urbanism and architecture of our cities
p85
aVassured identity and belonging not by separation,
p86
aVbut by intertwining.
p87
aVBut over time, the ancient became worthless, and the new, coveted.
p88
aVThe harmony of the built environment and social environment
p89
aVgot trampled over by elements of modernity \u2014
p90
aVbrutal, unfinished concrete blocks,
p91
aVneglect, aesthetic devastation,
p92
aVdivisive urbanism that zoned communities by class, creed or affluence.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd the same was happening to the community.
p95
aVAs the shape of the built environment changed,
p96
aVso the lifestyles and sense of belonging of the communities
p97
aValso started changing.
p98
aVFrom a register of togetherness, of belonging,
p99
aVarchitecture became a way of differentiation,
p100
aVand communities started drifting apart
p101
aVfrom the very fabric that used to unite them,
p102
aVand from the soul of the place that used to represent their common existence.
p103
aa(lp104
VWhile many reasons had led to the Syrian war,
p105
aVwe shouldn't underestimate the way in which,
p106
aVby contributing to the loss  of identity and self-respect,
p107
aVurban zoning and misguided, inhumane architecture
p108
aVhave nurtured sectarian divisions and hatred.
p109
aVOver time, the united city has morphed into a city center
p110
aVwith ghettos along its circumference.
p111
aVAnd in turn, the coherent communities became distinct social groups,
p112
aValienated from each other and alienated from the place.
p113
aVFrom my point of view,
p114
aVlosing the sense of belonging to a place
p115
aVand a sense of sharing it with someone else
p116
aVhas made it a lot easier to destroy.
p117
aa(lp118
VThe clear example can be seen in the informal housing system,
p119
aVwhich used to host, before the war, over 40 percent of the population.
p120
aVYes, prior to the war, almost half of the Syrian population
p121
aVlived in slums,
p122
aVperipheral areas without proper infrastructure,
p123
aVmade of endless rows of bare block boxes
p124
aVcontaining people,
p125
aVpeople who mostly belonged to the same group,
p126
aVwhether based on religion, class, origin or all of the above.
p127
aa(lp128
VThis ghettoized urbanism proved to be a tangible precursor of war.
p129
aVConflict is much easier between pre-categorized areas \u2014
p130
aVwhere the "others" live.
p131
aVThe ties that used to bind the city together \u2014
p132
aVwhether they were social, through coherent building,
p133
aVor economic, through trade in the souk,
p134
aVor religious, through the coexistent presence \u2014
p135
aVwere all lost in the misguided and visionless modernization
p136
aVof the built environment.
p137
aa(lp138
VAllow me an aside.
p139
aVWhen I read about heterogeneous urbanism in other parts of the world,
p140
aVinvolving ethnic neighborhoods in British cities
p141
aVor around Paris or Brussels,
p142
aVI recognize the beginning of the kind of instability
p143
aVwe have witnessed so disastrously here in Syria.
p144
aa(lp145
VWe have severely destroyed cities,
p146
aVsuch as Homs, Aleppo, Daraa and many others,
p147
aVand almost half of the population of the country is now displaced.
p148
aa(lp149
VHopefully, the war will end,
p150
aVand the question that, as an architect, I have to ask, is:
p151
aVHow do we rebuild?
p152
aVWhat are the principles that we should adopt
p153
aVin order to avoid repeating the same mistakes?
p154
aVFrom my point of view, the main focus should be on creating places
p155
aVthat make their people feel they belong.
p156
aVArchitecture and planning need to recapture
p157
aVsome of the traditional values that did just that,
p158
aVcreating the conditions for coexistence and peace,
p159
aVvalues of beauty that don't exhibit ostentation,
p160
aVbut rather, approachability and ease,
p161
aVmoral values that promote generosity and acceptance,
p162
aVarchitecture that is for everyone to enjoy, not just for the elite,
p163
aVjust as used to be in the shadowed alleys of the old Islamic city,
p164
aVmixed designs that encourage a sense of community.
p165
aa(lp166
VThere is a neighborhood here in Homs that's called Baba Amr
p167
aVthat has been fully destroyed.
p168
aVAlmost two years ago, I introduced this design
p169
aVinto a UN-Habitat competition for rebuilding it.
p170
aVThe idea was to create an urban fabric inspired by a tree,
p171
aVcapable of growing and spreading organically,
p172
aVechoing the traditional bridge hanging over the old alleys,
p173
aVand incorporating apartments, private courtyards, shops,
p174
aVworkshops, places for parking and playing and leisure,
p175
aVtrees and shaded areas.
p176
aVIt's far from perfect, obviously.
p177
aVI drew it during the few hours of electricity we get.
p178
aVAnd there are many possible ways to express belonging and community
p179
aVthrough architecture.
p180
aVBut compare it with the freestanding, disconnected blocks
p181
aVproposed by the official project for rebuilding Baba Amr.
p182
aa(lp183
VArchitecture is not the axis around which all human life rotates,
p184
aVbut it has the power to suggest and even direct human activity.
p185
aVIn that sense, settlement, identity and social integration
p186
aVare all the producer and product of effective urbanism.
p187
aVThe coherent urbanism of the old Islamic city
p188
aVand of many old European towns, for instance,
p189
aVpromote integration,
p190
aVwhile rows of soulless housing or tower blocks,
p191
aVeven when they are luxurious,
p192
aVtend to promote isolation and "otherness."
p193
aVEven simple things
p194
aVlike shaded places or fruit plants or drinking water inside the city
p195
aVcan make a difference in how people feel towards the place,
p196
aVand whether they consider it a generous place that gives,
p197
aVa place that's worth keeping, contributing to,
p198
aVor whether they see it as an alienating place,
p199
aVfull of seeds of anger.
p200
aVIn order for a place to give, its architecture should be giving, too.
p201
aa(lp202
VOur built environment matters.
p203
aVThe fabric of our cities is reflected in the fabric of our souls.
p204
aVAnd whether in the shape of informal concrete slums
p205
aVor broken social housing
p206
aVor trampled old towns
p207
aVor forests of skyscrapers,
p208
aVthe contemporary urban archetypes
p209
aVthat have emerged all across the Middle East
p210
aVhave been one cause of the alienation and fragmentation of our communities.
p211
aa(lp212
VWe can learn from this.
p213
aVWe can learn how to rebuild in another way,
p214
aVhow to create an architecture that doesn't contribute only
p215
aVto the practical and economic aspects of people's lives,
p216
aVbut also to their social, spiritual and psychological needs.
p217
aVThose needs were totally overlooked in the Syrian cities before the war.
p218
aVWe need to create again cities that are shared
p219
aVby the communities that inhabit them.
p220
aVIf we do so, people will not feel the need
p221
aVto seek identities opposed to the other identities all around,
p222
aVbecause they will all feel at home.
p223
aa(lp224
VThank you for listening.

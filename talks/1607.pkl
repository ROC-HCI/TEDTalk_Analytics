VSo, people want a lot of things out of life,
p5
aVbut I think, more than anything else, they want happiness.
p6
aVAristotle called happiness "the chief good," the end
p7
aVtowards which all other things aim.
p8
aVAccording to this view, the reason we want a big house
p9
aVor a nice car
p10
aVor a good job
p11
aVisn't that these things are intrinsically valuable.
p12
aVIt's that we expect them to bring us
p13
aVhappiness.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow in the last 50 years, we Americans have gotten
p16
aVa lot of the things that we want. We're richer.
p17
aVWe live longer. We have access to technology
p18
aVthat would have seemed like science fiction
p19
aVjust a few years ago.
p20
aVThe paradox of happiness is that even though the
p21
aVobjective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically,
p22
aVwe haven't actually gotten any happier.
p23
aa(lp24
VMaybe because these conventional notions of progress
p25
aVhaven't delivered big benefits in terms of happiness,
p26
aVthere's been an increased interest in recent years
p27
aVin happiness itself.
p28
aVPeople have been debating the causes of happiness
p29
aVfor a really long time, in fact for thousands of years,
p30
aVbut it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved.
p31
aVWell, as with many other domains in life, I think
p32
aVthe scientific method has the potential to answer this question.
p33
aVIn fact, in the last few years, there's been an explosion
p34
aVin research on happiness. For example, we've learned a lot
p35
aVabout its demographics, how things like income
p36
aVand education, gender and marriage relate to it.
p37
aVBut one of the puzzles this has revealed is that
p38
aVfactors like these don't seem to have a particularly strong effect.
p39
aVYes, it's better to make more money rather than less,
p40
aVor to graduate from college instead of dropping out,
p41
aVbut the differences in happiness tend to be small.
p42
aa(lp43
VWhich leaves the question, what are the big causes of happiness?
p44
aVI think that's a question we haven't really answered yet,
p45
aVbut I think something that has the potential to be an answer
p46
aVis that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with
p47
aVthe contents of our moment-to-moment experiences.
p48
aVIt certainly seems that we're going about our lives,
p49
aVthat what we're doing, who we're with, what we're thinking about,
p50
aVhave a big influence on our happiness, and yet
p51
aVthese are the very factors that have been very difficult,
p52
aVin fact almost impossible, for scientists to study.
p53
aa(lp54
VA few years ago, I came up with a way to study people's happiness
p55
aVmoment to moment as they're going about their daily lives
p56
aVon a massive scale all over the world, something we'd never
p57
aVbeen able to do before. Called trackyourhappiness.org,
p58
aVit uses the iPhone to monitor people's happiness in real time.
p59
aVHow does this work? Basically, I send people signals
p60
aVat random points throughout the day, and then I ask them
p61
aVa bunch of questions about their moment-to-moment experience
p62
aVat the instant just before the signal.
p63
aVThe idea is that, if we can watch how people's happiness
p64
aVgoes up and down over the course of the day,
p65
aVminute to minute in some cases,
p66
aVand try to understand how what people are doing,
p67
aVwho they're with, what they're thinking about, and all
p68
aVthe other factors that describe our day, how those might
p69
aVrelate to those changes in happiness, we might be able
p70
aVto discover some of the things that really have
p71
aVa big influence on happiness.
p72
aVWe've been fortunate with this project to collect
p73
aVquite a lot of data, a lot more data of this kind than I think
p74
aVhas ever been collected before,
p75
aVover 650,000 real-time reports
p76
aVfrom over 15,000 people.
p77
aVAnd it's not just a lot of people, it's a really diverse group,
p78
aVpeople from a wide range of ages, from 18 to late 80s,
p79
aVa wide range of incomes, education levels,
p80
aVpeople who are married, divorced, widowed, etc.
p81
aVThey collectively represent every one of
p82
aV86 occupational categories and hail from over 80 countries.
p83
aa(lp84
VWhat I'd like to do with the rest of my time with you today
p85
aVis talk a little bit about one of the areas that we've been
p86
aVinvestigating, and that's mind-wandering.
p87
aVAs human beings, we have this unique ability
p88
aVto have our minds stray away from the present.
p89
aVThis guy is sitting here working on his computer,
p90
aVand yet he could be thinking about
p91
aVthe vacation he had last month,
p92
aVwondering what he's going to have for dinner.
p93
aVMaybe he's worried that he's going bald. (Laughter)
p94
aVThis ability to focus our attention on something other
p95
aVthan the present is really amazing. It allows us to learn
p96
aVand plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can.
p97
aVAnd yet it's not clear what the relationship is
p98
aVbetween our use of this ability and our happiness.
p99
aVYou've probably heard people suggest that you should
p100
aVstay focused on the present. "Be here now,"
p101
aVyou've probably heard a hundred times.
p102
aVMaybe, to really be happy, we need to stay completely
p103
aVimmersed and focused on our experience in the moment.
p104
aVMaybe these people are right. Maybe mind-wandering
p105
aVis a bad thing.
p106
aVOn the other hand, when our minds wander,
p107
aVthey're unconstrained. We can't change the physical reality
p108
aVin front of us, but we can go anywhere in our minds.
p109
aVSince we know people want to be happy, maybe
p110
aVwhen our minds wander, they're going to someplace happier than the place
p111
aVthat they're leaving. It would make a lot of sense.
p112
aVIn other words, maybe the pleasures of the mind
p113
aVallow us to increase our happiness with mind-wandering.
p114
aa(lp115
VWell, since I'm a scientist, I'd like to try to
p116
aVresolve this debate with some data, and in particular
p117
aVI'd like to present some data to you from three questions
p118
aVthat I ask with Track Your Happiness. Remember, this is from
p119
aVsort of moment-to-moment experience in people's real lives.
p120
aVThere are three questions. The first one is a happiness question:
p121
aVHow do you feel, on a scale ranging from very bad
p122
aVto very good? Second, an activity question:
p123
aVWhat are you doing, on a list of 22 different activities
p124
aVincluding things like eating and working and watching TV?
p125
aVAnd finally a mind-wandering question:
p126
aVAre you thinking about something other
p127
aVthan what you're currently doing?
p128
aVPeople could say no \u2014 in other words, I'm focused only on my task \u2014
p129
aVor yes \u2014 I am thinking about something else \u2014
p130
aVand the topic of those thoughts are pleasant,
p131
aVneutral or unpleasant.
p132
aVAny of those yes responses are what we called mind-wandering.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo what did we find?
p135
aVThis graph shows happiness on the vertical axis,
p136
aVand you can see that bar there representing how happy
p137
aVpeople are when they're focused on the present,
p138
aVwhen they're not mind-wandering.
p139
aVAs it turns out, people are substantially less happy
p140
aVwhen their minds are wandering than when they're not.
p141
aVNow you might look at this result and say, okay, sure,
p142
aVon average people are less happy when they're mind-wandering,
p143
aVbut surely when their minds are straying away
p144
aVfrom something that wasn't very enjoyable to begin with,
p145
aVat least then mind-wandering should be doing something good for us.
p146
aVNope. As it turns out,
p147
aVpeople are less happy when they're mind-wandering
p148
aVno matter what they're doing. For example,
p149
aVpeople don't really like commuting to work very much.
p150
aVIt's one of their least enjoyable activities, and yet
p151
aVthey are substantially happier when they're focused
p152
aVonly on their commute than when their mind is going
p153
aVoff to something else.
p154
aVIt's amazing.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo how could this be happening? I think part of the reason,
p157
aVa big part of the reason, is that when our minds wander,
p158
aVwe often think about unpleasant things, and they are
p159
aVenormously less happy when they do that,
p160
aVour worries, our anxieties, our regrets,
p161
aVand yet even when people are thinking about something
p162
aVneutral, they're still considerably less happy
p163
aVthan when they're not mind-wandering at all.
p164
aVEven when they're thinking about something they would describe as pleasant,
p165
aVthey're actually just slightly less happy
p166
aVthan when they aren't mind-wandering.
p167
aVIf mind-wandering were a slot machine, it would be like
p168
aVhaving the chance to lose 50 dollars, 20 dollars
p169
aVor one dollar. Right? You'd never want to play. (Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VSo I've been talking about this, suggesting, perhaps,
p172
aVthat mind-wandering causes unhappiness, but all
p173
aVI've really shown you is that these two things are correlated.
p174
aVIt's possible that's the case, but it might also be the case
p175
aVthat when people are unhappy, then they mind-wander.
p176
aVMaybe that's what's really going on. How could we ever
p177
aVdisentangle these two possibilites?
p178
aVWell, one fact that we can take advantage of, I think a fact
p179
aVyou'll all agree is true, is that time goes forward, not
p180
aVbackward. Right? The cause has to come before the effect.
p181
aVWe're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person,
p182
aVand so we can look and see, does mind-wandering
p183
aVtend to precede unhappiness, or does unhappiness
p184
aVtend to precede mind-wandering, to get some insight
p185
aVinto the causal direction.
p186
aVAs it turns out, there is a strong relationship between
p187
aVmind-wandering now and being unhappy a short time later,
p188
aVconsistent with the idea that mind-wandering is causing people to be unhappy.
p189
aVIn contrast, there's no relationship between being unhappy
p190
aVnow and mind-wandering a short time later.
p191
aVIn other words, mind-wandering very likely seems to be
p192
aVan actual cause, and not merely a consequence, of unhappiness.
p193
aa(lp194
VA few minutes ago, I likened mind-wandering
p195
aVto a slot machine you'd never want to play.
p196
aVWell, how often do people's minds wander?
p197
aVTurns out, they wander a lot. In fact, really a lot.
p198
aVForty-seven percent of the time, people are thinking
p199
aVabout something other than what they're currently doing.
p200
aVHow does that depend on what people are doing?
p201
aVThis shows the rate of mind-wandering across 22 activities
p202
aVranging from a high of 65 percent \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p203
aVwhen people are taking a shower, brushing their teeth,
p204
aVto 50 percent when they're working,
p205
aVto 40 percent when they're exercising,
p206
aVall the way down to this one short bar on the right
p207
aVthat I think some of you are probably laughing at.
p208
aVTen percent of the time people's minds are wandering
p209
aVwhen they're having sex. (Laughter)
p210
aVBut there's something I think that's quite interesting in this graph,
p211
aVand that is, basically with one exception,
p212
aVno matter what people are doing, they're mind-wandering
p213
aVat least 30 percent of the time, which suggests, I think,
p214
aVthat mind-wandering isn't just frequent, it's ubiquitous.
p215
aVIt pervades basically everything that we do.
p216
aa(lp217
VIn my talk today, I've told you a little bit about mind-wandering,
p218
aVa variable that I think turns out to be fairly important
p219
aVin the equation for happiness.
p220
aVMy hope is that over time, by tracking people's
p221
aVmoment-to-moment happiness and their experiences
p222
aVin daily life, we'll be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness,
p223
aVand then in the end, a scientific understanding of happiness
p224
aVwill help us create a future that's not only richer
p225
aVand healthier, but happier as well.
p226
aVThank you. (Applause)
p227
aV(Applause)

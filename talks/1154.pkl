VThe story I wanted to share with you today
p5
aVis my challenge as an Iranian artist,
p6
aVas an Iranian woman artist,
p7
aVas an Iranian woman artist
p8
aVliving in exile.
p9
aVWell, it has its pluses and minuses.
p10
aVOn the dark side,
p11
aVpolitics doesn't seem to escape people like me.
p12
aVEvery Iranian artist, in one form or another,
p13
aVis political.
p14
aVPolitics have defined our lives.
p15
aVIf you're living in Iran,
p16
aVyou're facing censorship, harassment,
p17
aVarrest, torture \u2014
p18
aVat times, execution.
p19
aVIf you're living outside like me,
p20
aVyou're faced with life in exile \u2014
p21
aVthe pain of the longing
p22
aVand the separation from your loved ones
p23
aVand your family.
p24
aVTherefore, we don't find
p25
aVthe moral, emotional,
p26
aVpsychological and political space
p27
aVto distance ourselves from the reality
p28
aVof social responsibility.
p29
aa(lp30
VOddly enough,
p31
aVan artist such as myself
p32
aVfinds herself also in the position of being the voice,
p33
aVthe speaker of my people,
p34
aVeven if I have, indeed,
p35
aVno access to my own country.
p36
aVAlso, people like myself,
p37
aVwe're fighting two battles on different grounds.
p38
aVWe're being critical of the West,
p39
aVthe perception of the West
p40
aVabout our identity \u2014
p41
aVabout the image that is constructed about us,
p42
aVabout our women, about our politics,
p43
aVabout our religion.
p44
aVWe are there to take pride
p45
aVand insist on respect.
p46
aVAnd at the same time,
p47
aVwe're fighting another battle.
p48
aVThat is our regime,
p49
aVour government \u2014
p50
aVour atrocious government,
p51
aV[that] has done every crime
p52
aVin order to stay in power.
p53
aVOur artists are at risk.
p54
aVWe are in a position of danger.
p55
aVWe pose a threat
p56
aVto the order of the government.
p57
aa(lp58
VBut ironically,
p59
aVthis situation
p60
aVhas empowered all of us,
p61
aVbecause we are considered, as artists,
p62
aVcentral to the cultural, political,
p63
aVsocial discourse in Iran.
p64
aVWe are there to inspire, to provoke,
p65
aVto mobilize,
p66
aVto bring hope to our people.
p67
aVWe are the reporters of our people,
p68
aVand are communicators
p69
aVto the outside world.
p70
aVArt is our weapon.
p71
aVCulture is a form of resistance.
p72
aVI envy sometimes the artists of the West
p73
aVfor their freedom of expression.
p74
aVFor the fact that they can distance themselves
p75
aVfrom the question of politics.
p76
aVFrom the fact that they are only serving one audience,
p77
aVmainly the Western culture.
p78
aVBut also, I worry about the West,
p79
aVbecause often in this country,
p80
aVin this Western world that we have,
p81
aVculture risks being a form of entertainment.
p82
aVOur people depend on our artists,
p83
aVand culture is beyond communication.
p84
aa(lp85
VMy journey as an artist
p86
aVstarted from a very, very personal place.
p87
aVI did not start
p88
aVto make social commentary
p89
aVabout my country.
p90
aVThe first one that you see in front of you
p91
aVis actually when I first returned to Iran
p92
aVafter being separated for a good 12 years.
p93
aVIt was after the Islamic Revolution
p94
aVof 1979.
p95
aVWhile I was absent from Iran,
p96
aVthe Islamic Revolution had descended on Iran
p97
aVand had entirely transformed the country
p98
aVfrom Persian to the Islamic culture.
p99
aVI came mainly to be reunited with my family
p100
aVand to reconnect in a way
p101
aVthat I found my place in the society.
p102
aVBut instead, I found a country
p103
aVthat was totally ideological
p104
aVand that I didn't recognize anymore.
p105
aVMore so, I became very interested,
p106
aVas I was facing
p107
aVmy own personal dilemmas and questions,
p108
aVI became immersed in the study
p109
aVof the Islamic Revolution \u2014
p110
aVhow, indeed,
p111
aVit had incredibly transformed
p112
aVthe lives of Iranian women.
p113
aVI found the subject of Iranian women
p114
aVimmensely interesting,
p115
aVin the way the women of Iran, historically,
p116
aVseemed to embody the political transformation.
p117
aVSo in a way, by studying a woman,
p118
aVyou can read the structure and the ideology of the country.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo I made a group of work
p121
aVthat at once faced my own personal questions in life,
p122
aVand yet it brought my work into a larger discourse \u2014
p123
aVthe subject of martyrdom,
p124
aVthe question of those who willingly stand in that intersection
p125
aVof love of God, faith,
p126
aVbut violence and crime and cruelty.
p127
aVFor me, this became incredibly important.
p128
aVAnd yet, I had an unusual position toward this.
p129
aVI was an outsider
p130
aVwho had come back to Iran to find my place,
p131
aVbut I was not in a position
p132
aVto be critical of the government
p133
aVor the ideology of the Islamic Revolution.
p134
aVThis changed slowly
p135
aVas I found my voice
p136
aVand I discovered things
p137
aVthat I didn't know I would discover.
p138
aVSo my art became slightly more critical.
p139
aVMy knife became a little sharper.
p140
aVAnd I fell into a life in exile.
p141
aVI am a nomadic artist.
p142
aVI work in Morocco, in Turkey, in Mexico.
p143
aVI go everywhere to make believe it's Iran.
p144
aa(lp145
VNow I am making films.
p146
aVLast year, I finished a film
p147
aVcalled "Women Without Men."
p148
aV"Women Without Men" returns to history,
p149
aVbut another part of our Iranian history.
p150
aVIt goes to 1953
p151
aVwhen American CIA exercised a coup
p152
aVand removed a democratically elected leader,
p153
aVDr. Mossadegh.
p154
aVThe book is written by an Iranian woman,
p155
aVShahrnush Parsipur.
p156
aVIt's a magical realist novel.
p157
aVThis book is banned,
p158
aVand she spent five years in prison.
p159
aVMy obsession with this book,
p160
aVand the reason I made this into a film,
p161
aVis because it at once was addressing
p162
aVthe question of being a female \u2014
p163
aVtraditionally, historically in Iran \u2014
p164
aVand the question of four women
p165
aVwho are all looking for an idea
p166
aVof change, freedom and democracy \u2014
p167
aVwhile the country of Iran, equally, as if another character,
p168
aValso struggled for an idea
p169
aVof freedom and democracy
p170
aVand independence from the foreign interventions.
p171
aa(lp172
VI made this film
p173
aVbecause I felt it's important
p174
aVfor it to speak to the Westerners
p175
aVabout our history as a country.
p176
aVThat all of you seem to remember Iran
p177
aVafter the Islamic Revolution.
p178
aVThat Iran was once a secular society,
p179
aVand we had democracy,
p180
aVand this democracy was stolen from us
p181
aVby the American government,
p182
aVby the British government.
p183
aVThis film also speaks to the Iranian people
p184
aVin asking them to return to their history
p185
aVand look at themselves before they were so Islamicized \u2014
p186
aVin the way we looked, in the way we played music,
p187
aVin the way we had intellectual life.
p188
aVAnd most of all,
p189
aVin the way that we fought for democracy.
p190
aVThese are some of the shots actually from my film.
p191
aVThese are some of the images of the coup.
p192
aVAnd we made this film in Casablanca,
p193
aVrecreating all the shots.
p194
aa(lp195
VThis film tried to find a balance
p196
aVbetween telling a political story,
p197
aVbut also a feminine story.
p198
aVBeing a visual artist, indeed,
p199
aVI am foremost interested to make art \u2014
p200
aVto make art that transcends
p201
aVpolitics, religion,
p202
aVthe question of feminism,
p203
aVand become an important, timeless,
p204
aVuniversal work of art.
p205
aVThe challenge I have
p206
aVis how to do that.
p207
aVHow to tell a political story but an allegorical story.
p208
aVHow to move you with your emotions,
p209
aVbut also make your mind work.
p210
aVThese are some of the images
p211
aVand the characters of the film.
p212
aVNow comes the green movement \u2014
p213
aVthe summer of 2009,
p214
aVas my film is released \u2014
p215
aVthe uprising begins in the streets of Tehran.
p216
aa(lp217
VWhat is unbelievably ironic
p218
aVis the period that we tried to depict in the film,
p219
aVthe cry for democracy
p220
aVand social justice,
p221
aVrepeats itself now
p222
aVagain in Tehran.
p223
aVThe green movement
p224
aVsignificantly inspired the world.
p225
aVIt brought a lot of attention to all those Iranians
p226
aVwho stand for basic human rights
p227
aVand struggle for democracy.
p228
aVWhat was most significant for me
p229
aVwas, once again,
p230
aVthe presence of the women.
p231
aVThey're absolutely inspirational for me.
p232
aVIf in the Islamic Revolution,
p233
aVthe images of the woman portrayed
p234
aVwere submissive
p235
aVand didn't have a voice,
p236
aVnow we saw a new idea of feminism
p237
aVin the streets of Tehran \u2014
p238
aVwomen who were educated,
p239
aVforward thinking, non-traditional,
p240
aVsexually open, fearless
p241
aVand seriously feminist.
p242
aVThese women and those young men
p243
aVunited Iranians
p244
aVacross the world, inside and outside.
p245
aa(lp246
VI then discovered
p247
aVwhy I take so much inspiration
p248
aVfrom Iranian women.
p249
aVThat, under all circumstances,
p250
aVthey have pushed the boundary.
p251
aVThey have confronted the authority.
p252
aVThey have broken every rule
p253
aVin the smallest and the biggest way.
p254
aVAnd once again, they proved themselves.
p255
aVI stand here to say
p256
aVthat Iranian women have found a new voice,
p257
aVand their voice is giving me my voice.
p258
aVAnd it's a great honor
p259
aVto be an Iranian woman and an Iranian artist,
p260
aVeven if I have to operate in the West only for now.
p261
aa(lp262
VThank you so much.

VExtraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,
p5
aVand it is my job, my responsibility, as an astronomer
p6
aVto remind people that alien hypotheses should always be a last resort.
p7
aa(lp8
VNow, I want to tell you a story about that.
p9
aVIt involves data from a NASA mission,
p10
aVordinary people and one of the most extraordinary stars in our galaxy.
p11
aa(lp12
VIt began in 2009 with the launch of NASA's Kepler mission.
p13
aVKepler's main scientific objective
p14
aVwas to find planets outside of our solar system.
p15
aVIt did this by staring at a single field in the sky,
p16
aVthis one, with all the tiny boxes.
p17
aVAnd in this one field,
p18
aVit monitored the brightness of over 150,000 stars
p19
aVcontinuously for four years,
p20
aVtaking a data point every 30 minutes.
p21
aVIt was looking for what astronomers call a transit.
p22
aVThis is when the planet's orbit is aligned in our line of sight,
p23
aVjust so that the planet crosses in front of a star.
p24
aVAnd when this happens, it blocks out a tiny bit of starlight,
p25
aVwhich you can see as a dip in this curve.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd so the team at NASA had developed very sophisticated computers
p28
aVto search for transits in all the Kepler data.
p29
aa(lp30
VAt the same time of the first data release,
p31
aVastronomers at Yale were wondering an interesting thing:
p32
aVWhat if computers missed something?
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd so we launched the citizen science project called Planet Hunters
p35
aVto have people look at the same data.
p36
aVThe human brain has an amazing ability for pattern recognition,
p37
aVsometimes even better than a computer.
p38
aVHowever, there was a lot of skepticism around this.
p39
aVMy colleague, Debra Fischer, founder of the Planet Hunters project,
p40
aVsaid that people at the time were saying,
p41
aV"You're crazy. There's no way that a computer will miss a signal."
p42
aVAnd so it was on, the classic human versus machine gamble.
p43
aVAnd if we found one planet, we would be thrilled.
p44
aVWhen I joined the team four years ago,
p45
aVwe had already found a couple.
p46
aVAnd today, with the help of over 300,000 science enthusiasts,
p47
aVwe have found dozens,
p48
aVand we've also found one of the most mysterious stars
p49
aVin our galaxy.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo to understand this,
p52
aVlet me show you what a normal transit in Kepler data looks like.
p53
aVOn this graph on the left-hand side you have the amount of light,
p54
aVand on the bottom is time.
p55
aVThe white line is light just from the star,
p56
aVwhat astronomers call a light curve.
p57
aVNow, when a planet transits a star, it blocks out a little bit of this light,
p58
aVand the depth of this transit reflects the size of the object itself.
p59
aVAnd so, for example, let's take Jupiter.
p60
aVPlanets don't get much bigger than Jupiter.
p61
aVJupiter will make a one percent drop in a star's brightness.
p62
aVEarth, on the other hand, is 11 times smaller than Jupiter,
p63
aVand the signal is barely visible in the data.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo back to our mystery.
p66
aVA few years ago, Planet Hunters were sifting through data looking for transits,
p67
aVand they spotted a mysterious signal coming from the star KIC 8462852.
p68
aVThe observations in May of 2009 were the first they spotted,
p69
aVand they started talking about this in the discussion forums.
p70
aa(lp71
VThey said and object like Jupiter
p72
aVwould make a drop like this in the star's light,
p73
aVbut they were also saying it was giant.
p74
aVYou see, transits normally only last for a few hours,
p75
aVand this one lasted for almost a week.
p76
aa(lp77
VThey were also saying that it looks asymmetric,
p78
aVmeaning that instead of the clean, U-shaped dip that we saw with Jupiter,
p79
aVit had this strange slope that you can see on the left side.
p80
aVThis seemed to indicate
p81
aVthat whatever was getting in the way and blocking the starlight
p82
aVwas not circular like a planet.
p83
aVThere are few more dips that happened,
p84
aVbut for a couple of years, it was pretty quiet.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd then in March of 2011, we see this.
p87
aVThe star's light drops by a whole 15 percent,
p88
aVand this is huge compared to a planet,
p89
aVwhich would only make a one percent drop.
p90
aVWe described this feature as both smooth and clean.
p91
aVIt also is asymmetric,
p92
aVhaving a gradual dimming that lasts almost a week,
p93
aVand then it snaps right back up to normal in just a matter of days.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd again, after this, not much happens
p96
aVuntil February of 2013.
p97
aVThings start to get really crazy.
p98
aVThere is a huge complex of dips in the light curve that appear,
p99
aVand they last for like a hundred days,
p100
aVall the way up into the Kepler mission's end.
p101
aVThese dips have variable shapes.
p102
aVSome are very sharp, and some are broad,
p103
aVand they also have variable durations.
p104
aVSome last just for a day or two, and some for more than a week.
p105
aVAnd there's also up and down trends within some of these dips,
p106
aValmost like several independent events were superimposed on top of each other.
p107
aVAnd at this time, this star drops in its brightness over 20 percent.
p108
aVThis means that whatever is blocking its light
p109
aVhas an area of over 1,000 times the area of our planet Earth.
p110
aa(lp111
VThis is truly remarkable.
p112
aVAnd so the citizen scientists, when they saw this,
p113
aVthey notified the science team that they found something weird enough
p114
aVthat it might be worth following up.
p115
aVAnd so when the science team looked at it,
p116
aVwe're like, "Yeah, there's probably just something wrong with the data."
p117
aVBut we looked really, really, really hard,
p118
aVand the data were good.
p119
aVAnd so what was happening had to be astrophysical,
p120
aVmeaning that something in space was getting in the way
p121
aVand blocking starlight.
p122
aVAnd so at this point,
p123
aVwe set out to learn everything we could about the star
p124
aVto see if we could find any clues to what was going on.
p125
aVAnd the citizen scientists who helped us in this discovery,
p126
aVthey joined along for the ride
p127
aVwatching science in action firsthand.
p128
aa(lp129
VFirst, somebody said, you know, what if this star was very young
p130
aVand it still had the cloud of material it was born from surrounding it.
p131
aVAnd then somebody else said,
p132
aVwell, what if the star had already formed planets,
p133
aVand two of these planets had collided,
p134
aVsimilar to the Earth-Moon forming event.
p135
aVWell, both of these theories could explain part of the data,
p136
aVbut the difficulties were that the star showed no signs of being young,
p137
aVand there was no glow from any of the material
p138
aVthat was heated up by the star's light,
p139
aVand you would expect this if the star was young
p140
aVor if there was a collision and a lot of dust was produced.
p141
aVAnd so somebody else said,
p142
aVwell, how about a huge swarm of comets
p143
aVthat are passing by this star in a very elliptical orbit?
p144
aVWell, it ends up that this is actually consistent with our observations.
p145
aVBut I agree, it does feel a little contrived.
p146
aVYou see, it would take hundreds of comets
p147
aVto reproduce what we're observing.
p148
aVAnd these are only the comets
p149
aVthat happen to pass between us and the star.
p150
aVAnd so in reality, we're talking thousands to tens of thousands of comets.
p151
aVBut of all the bad ideas we had,
p152
aVthis one was the best.
p153
aVAnd so we went ahead and published our findings.
p154
aa(lp155
VNow, let me tell you, this was one of the hardest papers I ever wrote.
p156
aVScientists are meant to publish results,
p157
aVand this situation was far from that.
p158
aVAnd so we decided to give it a catchy title,
p159
aVand we called it: "Where's The Flux?"
p160
aVI will let you work out the acronym.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
VSo this isn't the end of the story.
p165
aVAround the same time I was writing this paper,
p166
aVI met with a colleague of mine, Jason Wright,
p167
aVand he was also writing a paper on Kepler data.
p168
aVAnd he was saying that with Kepler's extreme precision,
p169
aVit could actually detect alien megastructures around stars,
p170
aVbut it didn't.
p171
aVAnd then I showed him this weird data that our citizen scientists had found,
p172
aVand he said to me,
p173
aV"Aw crap, Tabby.
p174
aVNow I have to rewrite my paper."
p175
aa(lp176
VSo yes, the natural explanations were weak,
p177
aVand we were curious now.
p178
aVSo we had to find a way to rule out aliens.
p179
aVSo together, we convinced a colleague of ours
p180
aVwho works on SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence,
p181
aVthat this would be an extraordinary target to pursue.
p182
aVWe wrote a proposal to observe the star
p183
aVwith the world's largest radio telescope at the Green Bank Observatory.
p184
aa(lp185
VA couple months later,
p186
aVnews of this proposal got leaked to the press
p187
aVand now there are thousands of articles,
p188
aVover 10,000 articles, on this star alone.
p189
aVAnd if you search Google Images,
p190
aVthis is what you'll find.
p191
aa(lp192
VNow, you may be wondering, OK, Tabby, well,
p193
aVhow do aliens actually explain this light curve?
p194
aVOK, well, imagine a civilization that's much more advanced than our own.
p195
aVIn this hypothetical circumstance,
p196
aVthis civilization would have exhausted the energy supply of their home planet,
p197
aVso where could they get more energy?
p198
aVWell, they have a host star just like we have a sun,
p199
aVand so if they were able to capture more energy from this star,
p200
aVthen that would solve their energy needs.
p201
aVSo they would go and build huge structures.
p202
aVThese giant megastructures,
p203
aVlike ginormous solar panels, are called Dyson spheres.
p204
aa(lp205
VThis image above
p206
aVare lots of artists' impressions of Dyson spheres.
p207
aVIt's really hard to provide perspective on the vastness of these things,
p208
aVbut you can think of it this way.
p209
aVThe Earth-Moon distance is a quarter of a million miles.
p210
aVThe simplest element on one of these structures
p211
aVis 100 times that size.
p212
aVThey're enormous.
p213
aVAnd now imagine one of these structures in motion around a star.
p214
aVYou can see how it would produce anomalies in the data
p215
aVsuch as uneven, unnatural looking dips.
p216
aa(lp217
VBut it remains that even alien megastructures
p218
aVcannot defy the laws of physics.
p219
aVYou see, anything that uses a lot of energy
p220
aVis going to produce heat,
p221
aVand we don't observe this.
p222
aVBut it could be something as simple
p223
aVas they're just reradiating it away in another direction,
p224
aVjust not at Earth.
p225
aa(lp226
VAnother idea that's one of my personal favorites
p227
aVis that we had just witnessed an interplanetary space battle
p228
aVand the catastrophic destruction of a planet.
p229
aVNow, I admit that this would produce a lot of dust
p230
aVthat we don't observe.
p231
aVBut if we're already invoking aliens in this explanation,
p232
aVthen who is to say they didn't efficiently clean up all this mess
p233
aVfor recycling purposes?
p234
aa(lp235
V(Laughter)
p236
aa(lp237
VYou can see how this quickly captures your imagination.
p238
aa(lp239
VWell, there you have it.
p240
aVWe're in a situation that could unfold
p241
aVto be a natural phenomenon we don't understand
p242
aVor an alien technology we don't understand.
p243
aVPersonally, as a scientist, my money is on the natural explanation.
p244
aVBut don't get me wrong, I do think it would be awesome to find aliens.
p245
aVEither way, there is something new and really interesting to discover.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo what happens next?
p248
aVWe need to continue to observe this star
p249
aVto learn more about what's happening.
p250
aVBut professional astronomers, like me,
p251
aVwe have limited resources for this kind of thing,
p252
aVand Kepler is on to a different mission.
p253
aa(lp254
VAnd I'm happy to say that once again,
p255
aVcitizen scientists have come in and saved the day.
p256
aVYou see, this time,
p257
aVamateur astronomers with their backyard telescopes
p258
aVstepped up immediately and started observing this star nightly
p259
aVat their own facilities,
p260
aVand I am so excited to see what they find.
p261
aa(lp262
VWhat's amazing to me is that this star would have never been found by computers
p263
aVbecause we just weren't looking for something like this.
p264
aVAnd what's more exciting
p265
aVis that there's more data to come.
p266
aVThere are new missions that are coming up
p267
aVthat are observing millions more stars
p268
aVall over the sky.
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd just think: What will it mean when we find another star like this?
p271
aVAnd what will it mean if we don't find another star like this?
p272
aa(lp273
VThank you.
p274
aa(lp275
V(Applause)

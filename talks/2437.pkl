VI'm a textile artist
p5
aVmost widely known for starting the yarn bombing movement.
p6
aVYarn bombing is when you take knitted or crocheted material
p7
aVout into the urban environment, graffiti-style \u2014
p8
aVor, more specifically,
p9
aVwithout permission and unsanctioned.
p10
aa(lp11
VBut when I started this over 10 years ago,
p12
aVI didn't have a word for it,
p13
aVI didn't have any ambitious notions about it,
p14
aVI had no visions of grandeur.
p15
aVAll I wanted to see was something warm and fuzzy and human-like
p16
aVon the cold, steel, gray facade that I looked at everyday.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo I wrapped the door handle.
p19
aVI call this the Alpha Piece.
p20
aVLittle did I know that this tiny piece would change the course of my life.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo clearly the reaction was interesting.
p23
aVIt intrigued me and I thought, "What else could I do?"
p24
aVCould I do something in the public domain that would get the same reaction?
p25
aVSo I wrapped the stop sign pole near my house.
p26
aVThe reaction was wild.
p27
aVPeople would park their cars
p28
aVand get out of their cars and stare at it,
p29
aVand scratch their heads and stare at it,
p30
aVand take pictures of it and take pictures next to it,
p31
aVand all of that was really exciting to me
p32
aVand I wanted to do every stop sign pole in the neighborhood.
p33
aVAnd the more that I did, the stronger the reaction.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo at this point I'm smitten.
p36
aVI'm hooked.
p37
aVThis was all seductive.
p38
aVI found my new passion
p39
aVand the urban environment was my playground.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo this is some of my early work.
p42
aVI was very curious about this idea of enhancing the ordinary,
p43
aVthe mundane, even the ugly,
p44
aVand not taking away its identity or its functionality
p45
aVbut just giving it a well-tailored suit out of knitting.
p46
aVAnd this was fun for me.
p47
aVIt was really fun to take inanimate objects
p48
aVand have them come to life.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo ...
p51
aVI think we all see the humor in this,
p52
aVbut \u2014
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VI was at a point where I wanted to take it seriously.
p57
aVI wanted to analyze it.
p58
aVI wanted to know why I was letting this take over my life,
p59
aVwhy I was passionate about it,
p60
aVwhy were other people reacting so strongly to it.
p61
aVAnd I realized something.
p62
aVWe all live in this fast-paced, digital world,
p63
aVbut we still crave and desire something that's relatable.
p64
aa(lp65
VI think we've all become desensitized
p66
aVby our overdeveloped cities that we live in,
p67
aVand billboards and advertisements,
p68
aVand giant parking lots,
p69
aVand we don't even complain about that stuff anymore.
p70
aVSo when you stumble upon
p71
aVa stop sign pole that's wrapped in knitting
p72
aVand it seems so out of place
p73
aVand then gradually \u2014 weirdly \u2014
p74
aVyou find a connection to it,
p75
aVthat is the moment.
p76
aVThat is the moment I love
p77
aVand that is the moment I love to share with others.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo at this point, my curiosity grew.
p80
aVIt went from the fire hydrants and the stop sign poles
p81
aVto what else can I do with this material.
p82
aVCan I do something big and large-scale and insurmountable?
p83
aa(lp84
VSo that's when the bus happened.
p85
aVThis was a real game changer for me.
p86
aVI'll always have a soft spot in my heart for this one.
p87
aa(lp88
VAt this point, people were recognizing my work
p89
aVbut there wasn't much out there
p90
aVthat was wrapped in knitting that was large-scale,
p91
aVand this definitely was the first city bus to be wrapped in knitting.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo at this point, I'm experiencing,
p94
aVor I'm witnessing something interesting.
p95
aVI may have started yarn bombing but I certainly don't own it anymore.
p96
aVIt had reached global status.
p97
aVPeople from all over the world were doing this.
p98
aVAnd I know this because I would travel to certain parts of the world
p99
aVthat I'd never been to,
p100
aVand I'd stumble upon a stop sign pole and I knew I didn't wrap it.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo as I pursued my own goals with my art \u2014
p103
aVthis is a lot of my recent work \u2014
p104
aVso was yarn bombing.
p105
aVYarn bombing was also growing.
p106
aVAnd that experience showed me the hidden power of this craft
p107
aVand showed me
p108
aVthat there was this common language I had with the rest of the world.
p109
aVIt was through this granny hobby \u2014
p110
aVthis unassuming hobby \u2014
p111
aVthat I found commonality with people
p112
aVthat I never thought I'd have a connection with.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo as I tell my story today,
p115
aVI'd also like to convey to you
p116
aVthat hidden power can be found in the most unassuming places,
p117
aVand we all possess skills that are just waiting to be discovered.
p118
aa(lp119
VIf you think about our hands, these tools that are connected to us,
p120
aVand what they're capable of doing \u2014
p121
aVbuilding houses and furniture,
p122
aVand painting giant murals \u2014
p123
aVand most of the time we hold a controller or a cell phone.
p124
aVAnd I'm totally guilty of this as well.
p125
aVBut if you think about it,
p126
aVwhat would happen if you put those things down?
p127
aVWhat would you make? What would you create with your own hands?
p128
aa(lp129
VA lot of people think that I am a master knitter
p130
aVbut I actually couldn't knit a sweater to save my life.
p131
aVBut I did something interesting with knitting
p132
aVthat had never been done before.
p133
aa(lp134
VI also wasn't "supposed to be" an artist
p135
aVin the sense that I wasn't formally trained to do this \u2014
p136
aVI'm a math major actually.
p137
aVSo I didn't think this was in the cards for me,
p138
aVbut I also know that I didn't stumble upon this.
p139
aVAnd when this happened to me, I held on tight,
p140
aVI fought for it and I'm proud to say that I am a working artist today.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo as we ponder the future,
p143
aVknow that your future might not be so seamless.
p144
aVAnd one day, you might be as bored as I was
p145
aVand knit a door handle to change your world forever.
p146
aa(lp147
VThank you.

VWhen my father and I started a company
p5
aVto 3D print human tissues and organs,
p6
aVsome people initially thought we were a little crazy.
p7
aVBut since then, much progress has been made,
p8
aVboth in our lab and other labs around the world.
p9
aVAnd given this, we started getting questions like,
p10
aV"If you can grow human body parts,
p11
aVcan you also grow animal products like meat and leather?"
p12
aa(lp13
VWhen someone first suggested this to me,
p14
aVquite frankly I thought they were a little crazy,
p15
aVbut what I soon came to realize
p16
aVwas that this is not so crazy after all.
p17
aVWhat's crazy is what we do today.
p18
aVI'm convinced that in 30 years,
p19
aVwhen we look back on today
p20
aVand on how we raise and slaughter billions of animals
p21
aVto make our hamburgers and our handbags,
p22
aVwe'll see this as being wasteful
p23
aVand indeed crazy.
p24
aVDid you know that today we maintain
p25
aVa global herd of 60 billion animals
p26
aVto provide our meat, dairy, eggs and leather goods?
p27
aVAnd over the next few decades,
p28
aVas the world's population expands to 10 billion,
p29
aVthis will need to nearly double
p30
aVto 100 billion animals.
p31
aa(lp32
VBut maintaining this herd
p33
aVtakes a major toll on our planet.
p34
aVAnimals are not just raw materials.
p35
aVThey're living beings,
p36
aVand already our livestock
p37
aVis one of the largest users of land,
p38
aVfresh water,
p39
aVand one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gases
p40
aVwhich drive climate change.
p41
aVOn top of this,
p42
aVwhen you get so many animals so close together,
p43
aVit creates a breeding ground for disease
p44
aVand opportunities for harm and abuse.
p45
aVClearly, we cannot continue on this path
p46
aVwhich puts the environment, public health,
p47
aVand food security at risk.
p48
aa(lp49
VThere is another way, because essentially,
p50
aVanimal products are just collections of tissues,
p51
aVand right now we breed and raise
p52
aVhighly complex animals
p53
aVonly to create products
p54
aVthat are made of relatively simple tissues.
p55
aVWhat if, instead of starting with a complex
p56
aVand sentient animal,
p57
aVwe started with what the tissues are made of,
p58
aVthe basic unit of life,
p59
aVthe cell?
p60
aa(lp61
VThis is biofabrication, where cells themselves
p62
aVcan be used to grow biological products
p63
aVlike tissues and organs.
p64
aVAlready in medicine,
p65
aVbiofabrication techniques have been used
p66
aVto grow sophisticated body parts,
p67
aVlike ears, windpipes, skin, blood vessels and bone,
p68
aVthat have been successfully implanted into patients.
p69
aVAnd beyond medicine, biofabrication can be
p70
aVa humane, sustainable and scalable new industry.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd we should begin by reimagining leather.
p73
aVI emphasize leather because it is so widely used.
p74
aVIt is beautiful, and it has long been a part of our history.
p75
aVGrowing leather is also technically simpler
p76
aVthan growing other animal products like meat.
p77
aVIt mainly uses one cell type,
p78
aVand it is largely two-dimensional.
p79
aVIt is also less polarizing for consumers and regulators.
p80
aVUntil biofabrication is better understood,
p81
aVit is clear that, initially at least,
p82
aVmore people would be willing to wear novel materials
p83
aVthan would be willing to eat novel foods,
p84
aVno matter how delicious.
p85
aVIn this sense, leather is a gateway material,
p86
aVa beginning for the mainstream biofabrication industry.
p87
aVIf we can succeed here,
p88
aVit brings our other consumer bioproducts like meat
p89
aVcloser on the horizon.
p90
aa(lp91
VNow how do we do it?
p92
aVTo grow leather, we begin by taking cells
p93
aVfrom an animal, through a simple biopsy.
p94
aVThe animal could be a cow,
p95
aVlamb, or even something more exotic.
p96
aVThis process does no harm,
p97
aVand Daisy the cow can live a happy life.
p98
aVWe then isolate the skin cells
p99
aVand multiply them in a cell culture medium.
p100
aVThis takes millions of cells
p101
aVand expands them into billions.
p102
aVAnd we then coax these cells to produce collagen,
p103
aVas they would naturally.
p104
aVThis collagen is the stuff between cells.
p105
aVIt's natural connective tissue.
p106
aVIt's the extracellular matrix,
p107
aVbut in leather, it's the main building block.
p108
aVAnd what we next do is we take the cells and their collagen
p109
aVand we spread them out to form sheets,
p110
aVand then we layer these thin sheets on top of one another,
p111
aVlike phyllo pastry, to form thicker sheets,
p112
aVwhich we then let mature.
p113
aVAnd finally, we take this multilayered skin
p114
aVand through a shorter and much less chemical tanning process,
p115
aVwe create leather.
p116
aVAnd so I'm very excited to show you,
p117
aVfor the first time,
p118
aVthe first batch of our cultured leather,
p119
aVfresh from the lab.
p120
aVThis is real, genuine leather,
p121
aVwithout the animal sacrifice.
p122
aVIt can have all the characteristics of leather
p123
aVbecause it is made of the same cells,
p124
aVand better yet,
p125
aVthere is no hair to remove,
p126
aVno scars or insect's bites,
p127
aVand no waste.
p128
aVThis leather can be grown in the shape of a wallet,
p129
aVa handbag or a car seat.
p130
aVIt is not limited to the irregular shape of a cow
p131
aVor an alligator.
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd because we make this material,
p134
aVwe grow this leather from the ground up,
p135
aVwe can control its properties in very interesting ways.
p136
aVThis piece of leather
p137
aVis a mere seven tissue layers thick,
p138
aVand as you can see, it is nearly transparent.
p139
aVAnd this leather is 21 layers thick and quite opaque.
p140
aVYou don't have that kind of fine control
p141
aVwith conventional leather.
p142
aVAnd we can tune this leather for other desirable qualities,
p143
aVlike softness, breathability,
p144
aVdurability, elasticity and even things like pattern.
p145
aVWe can mimic nature,
p146
aVbut in some ways also improve upon it.
p147
aVThis type of leather can do what today's leather does,
p148
aVbut with imagination, probably much more.
p149
aa(lp150
VWhat could the future of animal products look like?
p151
aVIt need not look like this,
p152
aVwhich is actually the state of the art today.
p153
aVRather, it could be much more like this.
p154
aVAlready, we have been manufacturing with cell cultures
p155
aVfor thousands of years, beginning with products
p156
aVlike wine, beer and yogurt.
p157
aVAnd speaking of food, our cultured food has evolved,
p158
aVand today we prepare cultured food
p159
aVin beautiful, sterile facilities like this.
p160
aVA brewery is essentially a bioreactor.
p161
aVIt is where cell culture takes place.
p162
aVImagine that in this facility,
p163
aVinstead of brewing beer,
p164
aVwe were brewing leather
p165
aVor meat.
p166
aVImagine touring this facility,
p167
aVlearning about how the leather or meat is cultured,
p168
aVseeing the process from beginning to end,
p169
aVand even trying some.
p170
aVIt's clean, open and educational,
p171
aVand this is in contrast to the hidden,
p172
aVguarded and remote factories
p173
aVwhere leather and meat is produced today.
p174
aVPerhaps biofabrication
p175
aVis a natural evolution of manufacturing for mankind.
p176
aVIt's environmentally responsible,
p177
aVefficient and humane.
p178
aVIt allows us to be creative.
p179
aVWe can design new materials, new products,
p180
aVand new facilities.
p181
aVWe need to move past just killing animals
p182
aVas a resource
p183
aVto something more civilized and evolved.
p184
aVPerhaps we are ready for something
p185
aVliterally and figuratively more cultured.
p186
aa(lp187
VThank you.

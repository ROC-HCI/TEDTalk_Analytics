VDan Holzman: Please throw out the beanbag chairs. Here we go.
p5
aa(lp6
VBarry Friedman: There are all kinds of high-tech chairs here today,
p7
aVbut this is really, I think, when it reached its peak
p8
aVas far as ergonomics, comfort, design, flexibility ...
p9
aa(lp10
VDH: Now obviously, this is not something we do on our regular show;
p11
aVit's something we just kind of learned for this,
p12
aVso we're going to try. But can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs?
p13
aa(lp14
VBF: Nice show, Daniel, nice show. You are the man!
p15
aVNice show. Man, that was good!
p16
aVDH: Thank you.
p17
aVBF: You know, sometimes when people do those, they go all the way down.
p18
aVYou actually just did that. (Laughter)
p19
aVThat's the kind of extra effort that's gotten us where we are today ...
p20
aa(lp21
VDH: All right, let's show them something special.
p22
aa(lp23
VBF: ... without a MacArthur grant.
p24
aVYeah, look at this. You know, all kinds of different ...
p25
aVTED is about invention, let's be honest. Right? DH: Yeah, it is.
p26
aa(lp27
VBF: Last night, Michael Moschen showed some juggling props
p28
aVhe has invented and working on.
p29
aVRight now, Dan's going to show something he actually invented.
p30
aa(lp31
VDH: A type of juggling I actually invented,
p32
aVright after I saw another juggler do it.
p33
aa(lp34
VBF: Shut up. (Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VDH: And this is a small excerpt from a longer piece.
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
V(Applause)
p41
aa(lp42
VFolks, this is shaker cup juggling. It's not a showstopper
p43
aVbut it certainly slows it down.
p44
aa(lp45
VBF: Oh yeah, it does. (Drum roll)
p46
aVBF: Oh, Daniel.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Applause)
p49
aa(lp50
VDH: One more? (Drum roll)
p51
aVPerfect. (Drum roll)
p52
aVPerfect. (Drum roll)
p53
aVBF: OK. DH: Oh! All right.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Applause)
p56
aa(lp57
VI'm now pushing my luck: I'm skipping right to six cups.
p58
aVIn order to do six cups, I must have perfect control
p59
aVover three with my right hand. (Drum roll)
p60
aa(lp61
VBF: Also three with his left.
p62
aa(lp63
VDH: Perfect.
p64
aa(lp65
V(Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd now, all six cups. Should I do it on the first try
p68
aVor should I miss once on purpose? (Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VBF: First try? Once on purpose?
p71
aa(lp72
V(Audience: Once on purpose!)
p73
aa(lp74
VDH: How about if I try first and then decide?
p75
aa(lp76
VBF: Good idea. (Laughter) Let's leave that. We'll leave that door open.
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p79
aa(lp80
VDH: He's looking at me.
p81
aa(lp82
VBF: That's all right, he does that. All right.
p83
aa(lp84
VDH: Oh! It's time for Richard's help. (Laughter)
p85
aVOh, good. All right.
p86
aa(lp87
VBF: You know, over the years, every year at the conference,
p88
aVit's kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous
p89
aVwith Richard. And we've always done something with the bullwhips
p90
aVin our act. It's funny, for years I did it with Daniel holding balloons.
p91
aVAnd then we thought, "How stupid."
p92
aa(lp93
VDH: Excuse me, could we work on the design of the microphone?
p94
aa(lp95
VBF: I think that's the next session.
p96
aa(lp97
VDH: Next session?
p98
aa(lp99
VBF: Yeah. And so we've actually found a way to incorporate Richard in this.
p100
aVHe actually assumes more of the danger in this.
p101
aa(lp102
VDH: Please stand up, Richard. (Whip cracks)
p103
aa(lp104
VOh, sorry. (Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VDH: Now Richard, please ... (Whip cracks)
p107
aa(lp108
VBF: OK, sorry.
p109
aa(lp110
VDH: Jesus Christ. Richard, please stand in front of me.
p111
aa(lp112
VRichard Wurman: Can I say something?
p113
aVBF: Sure.
p114
aa(lp115
VRW: In all past years I've rehearsed with them,
p116
aVthe things that have happened to me \u2014
p117
aVI have no idea what's going to happen and that's the truth.
p118
aa(lp119
VDH: All right, please stand here in front ...
p120
aVGod, I hate that. Put your hands out like this, please.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VBF: No, come stay up with him.
p125
aVDan used to actually hold them but now he's got you for protection.
p126
aVIt's kind of neat. OK.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VDH: Wow, you've been working out.
p131
aa(lp132
VBF: No, shut up!
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VHaving a little bit of Richard time. That's nice, that's good.
p137
aVOK, here we go.
p138
aVHave him hold your wrist so I can ...
p139
aa(lp140
VDH: Please hold my wrist, will you. BF: Yeah, hold this a minute.
p141
aa(lp142
VThere you go.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aVOK.
p146
aa(lp147
VOK, hold on.
p148
aa(lp149
VRW: Hmmm.
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VDH: First one.
p154
aa(lp155
VBF: All those mid-year phone calls are coming back to me now, Richard.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VDH: So Richard, what were we on the list? Like 1,020?
p160
aa(lp161
V(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VWhat happened there?
p164
aa(lp165
VBF: I think we were just outside.
p166
aa(lp167
VDH: I don't get it. (Applause)
p168
aa(lp169
V(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VDH: Sorry. BF: Having some bad flashbacks.
p172
aa(lp173
VRW: Do you want me to hold you or not? DH: Don't hold me that hard.
p174
aa(lp175
VBF: Here we go, I'm taking it. (Balloon pops) (Applause)
p176
aa(lp177
VDH: One more, one more.
p178
aa(lp179
VBF: We've got one more we're going to do.
p180
aa(lp181
VRW: Do I get to hold them?
p182
aa(lp183
VBF: You don't want to hold these, trust me.
p184
aa(lp185
VDH: Could you spread your legs a little bit?
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VBF: Gloria, you want to do it? It's very cool.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
V(Applause)
p194
aa(lp195
V(Laughter)
p196
aa(lp197
VOne more try. Man, I don't want to get too close.
p198
aa(lp199
V(Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
VCould you just push that?
p202
aa(lp203
V(Applause)
p204
aa(lp205
VDH: Wow! Boy!
p206
aa(lp207
VBF: That's cool. I always wanted to try that.
p208
aa(lp209
V(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
VDH: Let's jump this way, though.
p212
aVNow, we risked Richard's life, it's only fair we risk our own lives.
p213
aVSo to do that, I will juggle these three razor-sharp sickles.
p214
aVAnd if that wasn't enough, and judging by your response, it's not ...
p215
aa(lp216
V(Laughter)
p217
aa(lp218
VDH: Wow! BF: Hoping for a little more build.
p219
aa(lp220
VDH: True. Barry ...
p221
aa(lp222
VBF: I'm going to run up behind him.
p223
aa(lp224
VDH: Leap over my shoulder.
p225
aa(lp226
VBF: Up and over his shoulders.
p227
aa(lp228
VDH: Grab the blades in mid-air, land right there in a pool of blood ...
p229
aa(lp230
V(Laughter)
p231
aa(lp232
VStill juggling. (Laughter)
p233
aVImpossible, you say?
p234
aa(lp235
VBF: Incredible, you say?
p236
aa(lp237
VDH: Why bother, you say?
p238
aa(lp239
VBF: Here we go.
p240
aa(lp241
VDH: Just do it juggler boys, you say?
p242
aa(lp243
VBF: This guy, this guy invented air.
p244
aVDH: I think so, that's right.
p245
aVEven the pencil.
p246
aa(lp247
VBF: He invented the pencil.
p248
aa(lp249
VDH: All right, we'll do this trick, but please remember
p250
aVit took us over 10 years to perfect.
p251
aa(lp252
VBF: Ten years to perfect, which you're about to see.
p253
aa(lp254
VDH: It's not that difficult, we just don't like to practice that much.
p255
aa(lp256
VBF: No, it's a hassle. Traveling too much.
p257
aVActually, we will take a second to prove \u2014
p258
aVthis could be fake \u2014 that the blades are indeed razor-sharp.
p259
aa(lp260
VDH: Will someone please throw a small farm animal
p261
aVup onto the stage?
p262
aa(lp263
V(Laughter)
p264
aa(lp265
VOr a virgin for a sacrifice?
p266
aa(lp267
VBF: Anything?
p268
aa(lp269
VDH: Where's Gloria? (Laughter)
p270
aa(lp271
VBF: No, she's got ... farm animal.
p272
aa(lp273
VDH: Do you have a small farm animal?
p274
aVJust trying to play the odds. All right, here we go.
p275
aa(lp276
VBF: Over the top, over the top.
p277
aa(lp278
VDH: How you feeling, Barry? You feeling all right?
p279
aa(lp280
VBF: Yeah, it's all right.
p281
aa(lp282
VDH: Do you feel everything's OK? The atmosphere, the ...
p283
aa(lp284
VBF: Yeah, a little sketchy.
p285
aa(lp286
VDH: Everything up here's OK?
p287
aa(lp288
VBF: Yeah.
p289
aa(lp290
VDH: Then here we go.
p291
aa(lp292
VBF: This one's a little ... Who's doing the lights? Could you
p293
aVpoint that a little more directly
p294
aVinto my eyeballs? Is that possible? (Laughter) I can still see a little.
p295
aa(lp296
VDH: And turn up the intensity; we're still pink in the middle.
p297
aVWe went too far. (Laughter)
p298
aa(lp299
VBF: Yeah, it's too far. It's too much of a visual.
p300
aVThe design of the body is a whole different thing.
p301
aa(lp302
VDH: Ready, Barry? BF: Over the top.
p303
aa(lp304
VDH: May we have our jumping music please? (Silence)
p305
aVMay we have it a bit louder?
p306
aa(lp307
V(Laughter)
p308
aa(lp309
VBF: They're a good crew! Whoa!
p310
aa(lp311
VDH: Whoa, sorry. All right.
p312
aa(lp313
VBF: We're going on.
p314
aa(lp315
VDH: All right, we'll try again.
p316
aa(lp317
VBF: All right? Oh my gosh. Oh.
p318
aa(lp319
VDH: All right, here we go. Sorry about that.
p320
aa(lp321
VBF: I thought I had the hard part. OK.
p322
aa(lp323
VDH: Whenever you're ready.
p324
aa(lp325
VBF: There we go!
p326
aa(lp327
V(Applause)
p328
aa(lp329
VAll right, get up! Come on and dance! DH: Dance, come on. BF: Come on and dance!
p330
aVSomebody dance! Come on!
p331
aa(lp332
V(Applause)
p333
aa(lp334
VWow, wow, OK, stop.
p335
aVWeird, no one dances. We're two guys doing this. (Laughter)
p336
aVI think that's uncomfortable for everyone.
p337
aa(lp338
VDH: The French judge ...
p339
aa(lp340
VBF: One more quick thing.
p341
aa(lp342
VDH: The French judge gives it a 5.2.
p343
aa(lp344
V(Laughter)
p345
aa(lp346
VBF: Well, you know ...
p347
aa(lp348
VDH: There you go ... BF: Oh, yeah. Another one coming in.
p349
aa(lp350
VDH: Tell them about our bio and stuff.
p351
aa(lp352
VBF: Yeah. In our bio, some of you may have read
p353
aVthat we've won two world juggling championships.
p354
aVAnd believe it or not, you don't win juggling champions
p355
aVfor doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups.
p356
aVWe're going to show you right now
p357
aVan excerpt from a routine that we used
p358
aVto wipe out the other juggling team competition.
p359
aa(lp360
VDH: That's right.
p361
aa(lp362
VBF: Good.
p363
aa(lp364
VDH: I know what you're thinking: other juggling teams must really suck.
p365
aa(lp366
V(Laughter)
p367
aa(lp368
VBF: Juggling's got a bad rap.
p369
aa(lp370
VDH: But wait, Barry, there's still one more club lying there by my foot.
p371
aVAnd look, it has a twin!
p372
aa(lp373
VBF: Shut up. (Laughter)
p374
aa(lp375
VDH: There's still one more by my foot.
p376
aVWhat do you want me to do with it?
p377
aa(lp378
VBF: Richard you tell him, it's your last year. (Laughter)
p379
aa(lp380
VDH: That's a pretty good setup, Richard.
p381
aa(lp382
VBF: Yeah, it's a good setup. That's a big setup.
p383
aa(lp384
VDH: You can't get any better than that. All right. What I will do: I will use my panther-like reflexes.
p385
aa(lp386
VBF: Nice.
p387
aa(lp388
VDH: I got that \u2014
p389
aVto reach down and grab that club in my grip of steel.
p390
aa(lp391
VBF: Nice.
p392
aa(lp393
VDH: I touched it, Barry. That should be enough.
p394
aa(lp395
VBF: It's progress, that's the thing.
p396
aa(lp397
V(Laughter)
p398
aa(lp399
VDH: How about that? I'll do it again.
p400
aVOh wait, it's on your side, Barry.
p401
aVAnd it's awfully windy over there.
p402
aa(lp403
VBF: It is, it's weird. You wouldn't think
p404
aVit would affect half the stage, but it is. It's weird.
p405
aVWatch this: what I'm going to do is slide the seventh one onto my foot.
p406
aa(lp407
VDH: Wow! What a great trick, Barry!
p408
aVOh, look how it lies there.
p409
aVOh, Barry, is there nothing you can't do?
p410
aa(lp411
V(Laughter)
p412
aa(lp413
VYou are my hero. You're my Jim Shea, Jr.
p414
aVToo much Olympics.
p415
aa(lp416
VBF: From my foot, I'll attempt to kick the seventh club. Here we go.
p417
aa(lp418
VDH: Where, Barry? Where? Tell us, Barry.
p419
aV[Unclear] eagerly awaits your next syllable. What will it be?
p420
aVWhat gem of knowledge?
p421
aVWhat pearl of wisdom?
p422
aVDo you want to buy a vowel, Barry?
p423
aVIs that your final answer?
p424
aa(lp425
VBF: All right! You have to turn off the TV from time to time.
p426
aa(lp427
VDH: I do, I do.
p428
aVBF: From my foot, the kick up in the seven.
p429
aVDH: We will juggle seven.
p430
aa(lp431
VBF: From six to seven. DH: That's a world's record. BF: Really? DH: For us.
p432
aa(lp433
VBF: Yes.
p434
aa(lp435
VDH: Whenever you're ready there, big guy.
p436
aVPut your tongue away, Barry.
p437
aa(lp438
VBF: Oh, oh, whoa.
p439
aa(lp440
V(Applause)
p441
aa(lp442
VDH: Please, please stay seated. Stay seated. Thank you.
p443
aVBecause now, to make this twice as difficult,
p444
aVwe'll juggle the seven clubs back ...
p445
aa(lp446
VBF: Seven-club juggling.
p447
aa(lp448
VDH: ... to back.
p449
aa(lp450
VBF: Thank you, that's it.
p451
aa(lp452
VBF: Thank you guys!
p453
aa(lp454
VDH: Thank you very much!

VI want to start with a game. Okay?
p5
aVAnd to win this game,
p6
aVall you have to do is see the reality that's in front of you
p7
aVas it really is, all right?
p8
aVSo we have two panels here, of colored dots.
p9
aVAnd one of those dots is the same in the two panels.
p10
aVAnd you have to tell me which one.
p11
aa(lp12
VNow, I narrowed it down
p13
aVto the gray one, the green one, and, say, the orange one.
p14
aVSo by a show of hands, we'll start with the easiest one.
p15
aVShow of hands: how many people think it's the gray one?
p16
aVReally? Okay.
p17
aVHow many people think it's the green one?
p18
aVAnd how many people think it's the orange one?
p19
aVPretty even split.
p20
aa(lp21
VLet's find out what the reality is.
p22
aVHere is the orange one.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VHere is the green one.
p27
aVAnd here is the gray one.
p28
aa(lp29
V(Laughter)
p30
aa(lp31
VSo for all of you who saw that, you're complete realists.
p32
aVAll right?
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VSo this is pretty amazing, isn't it?
p37
aVBecause nearly every living system
p38
aVhas evolved the ability to detect light in one way or another.
p39
aVSo for us, seeing color
p40
aVis one of the simplest things the brain does.
p41
aVAnd yet, even at this most fundamental level,
p42
aVcontext is everything.
p43
aVWhat I'm going to talk about is not that context is everything,
p44
aVbut why context is everything.
p45
aVBecause it's answering that question
p46
aVthat tells us not only why we see what we do,
p47
aVbut who we are as individuals,
p48
aVand who we are as a society.
p49
aa(lp50
VBut first, we have to ask another question,
p51
aVwhich is, "What is color for?"
p52
aVAnd instead of telling you, I'll just show you.
p53
aVWhat you see here is a jungle scene,
p54
aVand you see the surfaces according to the amount of light
p55
aVthat those surfaces reflect.
p56
aVNow, can any of you see the predator that's about to jump out at you?
p57
aVAnd if you haven't seen it yet, you're dead, right?
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VCan anyone see it? Anyone? No?
p62
aVNow let's see the surfaces
p63
aVaccording to the quality of light that they reflect.
p64
aVAnd now you see it.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo, color enables us to see
p67
aVthe similarities and differences between surfaces,
p68
aVaccording to the full spectrum of light that they reflect.
p69
aVBut what you've just done
p70
aVis in many respects mathematically impossible.
p71
aVWhy?
p72
aVBecause, as Berkeley tells us,
p73
aVwe have no direct access to our physical world,
p74
aVother than through our senses.
p75
aVAnd the light that falls onto our eyes
p76
aVis determined by multiple things in the world,
p77
aVnot only the color of objects,
p78
aVbut also the color of their illumination,
p79
aVand the color of the space between us and those objects.
p80
aVYou vary any one of those parameters,
p81
aVand you'll change the color of the light that falls onto your eye.
p82
aa(lp83
VThis is a huge problem,
p84
aVbecause it means that the same image
p85
aVcould have an infinite number of possible real-world sources.
p86
aVLet me show you what I mean.
p87
aVImagine that this is the back of your eye, okay?
p88
aVAnd these are two projections from the world.
p89
aVThey're identical in every single way.
p90
aVIdentical in shape, size, spectral content.
p91
aVThey are the same, as far as your eye is concerned.
p92
aVAnd yet they come from completely different sources.
p93
aVThe one on the right comes from a yellow surface,
p94
aVin shadow, oriented facing the left,
p95
aVviewed through a pinkish medium.
p96
aVThe one on the left comes from an orange surface,
p97
aVunder direct light, facing to the right,
p98
aVviewed through sort of a bluish medium.
p99
aVCompletely different meanings,
p100
aVgiving rise to the exact same retinal information.
p101
aVAnd yet it's only the retinal information that we get.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo how on Earth do we even see?
p104
aVSo if you remember anything in this next 18 minutes,
p105
aVremember this:
p106
aVthat the light that falls onto your eye,
p107
aVsensory information, is meaningless,
p108
aVbecause it could mean literally anything.
p109
aVAnd what's true for sensory information is true for information generally.
p110
aVThere's no inherent meaning in information.
p111
aVIt's what we do with that information that matters.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo, how do we see? Well, we see by learning to see.
p114
aVThe brain evolved the mechanisms for finding patterns,
p115
aVfinding relationships in information,
p116
aVand associating those relationships with a behavioral meaning,
p117
aVa significance, by interacting with the world.
p118
aVWe're very aware of this
p119
aVin the form of more cognitive attributes, like language.
p120
aVI'm going to give you some letter strings,
p121
aVand I want you to read them out for me, if you can.
p122
aa(lp123
VAudience: "Can you read this?"
p124
aV"You are not reading this."
p125
aV"What are you reading?"
p126
aa(lp127
VBeau Lotto: "What are you reading?" Half the letters are missing, right?
p128
aVThere's no a priori reason
p129
aVwhy an "H" has to go between that "W" and "A."
p130
aVBut you put one there. Why?
p131
aVBecause in the statistics of your past experience,
p132
aVit would have been useful to do so.
p133
aVSo you do so again.
p134
aVAnd yet you don't put a letter after that first "T."
p135
aVWhy? Because it wouldn't have been useful in the past.
p136
aVSo you don't do it again.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo, let me show you how quickly our brains can redefine normality,
p139
aVeven at the simplest thing the brain does, which is color.
p140
aVSo if I could have the lights down up here.
p141
aVI want you to first notice that those two desert scenes are physically the same.
p142
aVOne is simply the flipping of the other.
p143
aVNow I want you to look at that dot
p144
aVbetween the green and the red.
p145
aVAnd I want you to stare at that dot. Don't look anywhere else.
p146
aVWe're going to look at it for about 30 seconds,
p147
aVwhich is a bit of a killer in an 18-minute talk.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VBut I really want you to learn.
p152
aVAnd I'll tell you \u2014 don't look anywhere else \u2014
p153
aVI'll tell you what's happening in your head.
p154
aVYour brain is learning,
p155
aVand it's learning that the right side of its visual field
p156
aVis under red illumination;
p157
aVthe left side of its visual field is under green illumination.
p158
aVThat's what it's learning. Okay?
p159
aVNow, when I tell you, I want you to look at the dot between the two desert scenes.
p160
aVSo why don't you do that now?
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
VCan I have the lights up again?
p165
aa(lp166
VI take it from your response they don't look the same anymore, right?
p167
aa(lp168
V(Applause)
p169
aa(lp170
VWhy? Because your brain is seeing that same information
p171
aVas if the right one is still under red light,
p172
aVand the left one is still under green light.
p173
aVThat's your new normal.
p174
aVOkay? So, what does this mean for context?
p175
aVIt means I can take two identical squares,
p176
aVput them in light and dark surrounds,
p177
aVand the one on the dark surround looks lighter than on the light surround.
p178
aVWhat's significant is not simply the light and dark surrounds that matter.
p179
aVIt's what those light and dark surrounds meant for your behavior in the past.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo I'll show you what I mean.
p182
aVHere we have that exact same illusion.
p183
aVWe have two identical tiles on the left,
p184
aVone in a dark surround, one in a light surround.
p185
aVAnd the same thing over on the right.
p186
aVNow, I'll reveal those two scenes,
p187
aVbut I'm not going to change anything within those boxes,
p188
aVexcept their meaning.
p189
aVAnd see what happens to your perception.
p190
aa(lp191
VNotice that on the left
p192
aVthe two tiles look nearly completely opposite:
p193
aVone very white and one very dark, right?
p194
aVWhereas on the right, the two tiles look nearly the same.
p195
aVAnd yet there is still one on a dark surround,
p196
aVand one on a light surround.
p197
aVWhy?
p198
aVBecause if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow,
p199
aVand reflecting the same amount of light to your eye
p200
aVas the one outside the shadow,
p201
aVit would have to be more reflective \u2014 just the laws of physics.
p202
aVSo you see it that way.
p203
aa(lp204
VWhereas on the right, the information is consistent
p205
aVwith those two tiles being under the same light.
p206
aVIf they're under the same light reflecting the same amount of light to your eye,
p207
aVthen they must be equally reflective.
p208
aVSo you see it that way.
p209
aVWhich means we can bring all this information together
p210
aVto create some incredibly strong illusions.
p211
aa(lp212
VThis is one I made a few years ago.
p213
aVAnd you'll notice you see a dark brown tile at the top,
p214
aVand a bright orange tile at the side.
p215
aVThat is your perceptual reality.
p216
aVThe physical reality is that those two tiles are the same.
p217
aa(lp218
VHere you see four gray tiles on your left,
p219
aVseven gray tiles on the right.
p220
aVI'm not going to change those tiles at all,
p221
aVbut I'm going to reveal the rest of the scene.
p222
aVAnd see what happens to your perception.
p223
aVThe four blue tiles on the left are gray.
p224
aVThe seven yellow tiles on the right are also gray.
p225
aVThey are the same. Okay?
p226
aVDon't believe me? Let's watch it again.
p227
aa(lp228
VWhat's true for color is also true for complex perceptions of motion.
p229
aVSo, here we have \u2014
p230
aVlet's turn this around \u2014 a diamond.
p231
aVAnd what I'm going to do is, I'm going to hold it here,
p232
aVand I'm going to spin it.
p233
aVAnd for all of you, you'll see it probably spinning this direction.
p234
aVNow I want you to keep looking at it.
p235
aVMove your eyes around, blink, maybe close one eye.
p236
aVAnd suddenly it will flip, and start spinning the opposite direction.
p237
aVYes? Raise your hand if you got that. Yes?
p238
aVKeep blinking.
p239
aVEvery time you blink, it will switch.
p240
aVSo I can ask you, which direction is it rotating?
p241
aVHow do you know?
p242
aVYour brain doesn't know, because both are equally likely.
p243
aVSo depending on where it looks,
p244
aVit flips between the two possibilities.
p245
aa(lp246
VAre we the only ones that see illusions?
p247
aVThe answer to this question is no.
p248
aVEven the beautiful bumblebee,
p249
aVwith its mere one million brain cells,
p250
aVwhich is 250 times fewer cells than you have in one retina,
p251
aVsees illusions, does the most complicated things
p252
aVthat even our most sophisticated computers can't do.
p253
aVSo in my lab we work on bumblebees,
p254
aVbecause we can completely control their experience,
p255
aVand see how it alters the architecture of their brain.
p256
aVWe do this in what we call the Bee Matrix.
p257
aa(lp258
VHere you have the hive.
p259
aVYou can see the queen bee, the large bee in the middle.
p260
aVThose are her daughters, the eggs.
p261
aVThey go back and forth between this hive and the arena, via this tube.
p262
aVYou'll see one of the bees come out here.
p263
aVYou see how she has a little number on her?
p264
aVThere's another one coming out, she also has a number on her.
p265
aVNow, they're not born that way, right?
p266
aVWe pull them out, put them in the fridge, and they fall asleep.
p267
aVThen you can superglue little numbers on them.
p268
aa(lp269
V(Laughter)
p270
aa(lp271
VAnd now, in this experiment they get a reward if they go to the blue flowers.
p272
aVThey land on the flower,
p273
aVstick their tongue in there, called a proboscis, and drink sugar water.
p274
aVShe's drinking a glass of water that's about that big to you and I,
p275
aVwill do that about three times, then fly.
p276
aVAnd sometimes they learn not to go to the blue,
p277
aVbut to go where the other bees go.
p278
aVSo they copy each other.
p279
aVThey can count to five. They can recognize faces.
p280
aVAnd here she comes down the ladder.
p281
aVAnd she'll come into the hive, find an empty honey pot,
p282
aVand throw up, and that's honey.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Laughter)
p285
aa(lp286
VNow remember, she's supposed to be going to the blue flowers,
p287
aVbut what are these bees doing in the upper right corner?
p288
aVIt looks like they're going to green flowers.
p289
aVNow, are they getting it wrong?
p290
aVAnd the answer to the question is no. Those are actually blue flowers.
p291
aVBut those are blue flowers under green light.
p292
aVSo they're using the relationships between the colors to solve the puzzle,
p293
aVwhich is exactly what we do.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo, illusions are often used,
p296
aVespecially in art, in the words of a more contemporary artist,
p297
aV"to demonstrate the fragility of our senses."
p298
aVOkay, this is complete rubbish.
p299
aVThe senses aren't fragile. And if they were, we wouldn't be here.
p300
aVInstead, color tells us something completely different,
p301
aVthat the brain didn't actually evolve to see the world the way it is.
p302
aVWe can't.
p303
aVInstead, the brain evolved to see the world
p304
aVthe way it was useful to see in the past.
p305
aVAnd how we see is by continually redefining normality.
p306
aa(lp307
VSo, how can we take this incredible capacity of plasticity of the brain
p308
aVand get people to experience their world differently?
p309
aVWell, one of the ways we do it in my lab and studio
p310
aVis we translate the light into sound,
p311
aVand we enable people to hear their visual world.
p312
aVAnd they can navigate the world using their ears.
p313
aa(lp314
VHere's David on the right, and he's holding a camera.
p315
aVOn the left is what his camera sees.
p316
aVAnd you'll see there's a faint line going across that image.
p317
aVThat line is broken up into 32 squares.
p318
aVIn each square, we calculate the average color.
p319
aVAnd then we just simply translate that into sound.
p320
aVAnd now he's going to turn around,
p321
aVclose his eyes,
p322
aVand find a plate on the ground with his eyes closed.
p323
aa(lp324

V(Sound changes momentarily)
p327
aa(lp328

p329
aa(lp330

aa(lp332

p333
aa(lp334
V(Sound changes momentarily)
p335
aa(lp336
VBeau Lotto: He finds it. Amazing, right?
p337
aVSo not only can we create a prosthetic for the visually impaired,
p338
aVbut we can also investigate
p339
aVhow people literally make sense of the world.
p340
aVBut we can also do something else.
p341
aVWe can also make music with color.
p342
aVSo, working with kids,
p343
aVthey created images,
p344
aVthinking about what might the images you see
p345
aVsound like if we could listen to them.
p346
aVAnd then we translated these images.
p347
aVAnd this is one of those images.
p348
aVAnd this is a six-year-old child composing a piece of music
p349
aVfor a 32-piece orchestra.
p350
aVAnd this is what it sounds like.
p351
aa(lp352
V(Electronic representation of orchestral music)
p353
aa(lp354
VSo, a six-year-old child. Okay?
p355
aa(lp356
VNow, what does all this mean?
p357
aVWhat this suggests is that no one is an outside observer of nature, okay?
p358
aVWe're not defined by our central properties,
p359
aVby the bits that make us up.
p360
aVWe're defined by our environment and our interaction with that environment,
p361
aVby our ecology.
p362
aVAnd that ecology is necessarily relative, historical and empirical.
p363
aVSo, what I'd like to finish with is this over here.
p364
aVBecause what I've been trying to do is really celebrate uncertainty.
p365
aVBecause I think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding.
p366
aa(lp367
VSo, if some of you are still feeling a bit too certain,
p368
aVI'd like to do this one.
p369
aVSo, if we have the lights down.
p370
aVAnd what we have here \u2014
p371
aVCan everyone see 25 purple surfaces on your left,
p372
aVand 25, call it yellowish, surfaces on your right?
p373
aVSo now, what I want to do,
p374
aVI'm going to put the middle nine surfaces here
p375
aVunder yellow illumination,
p376
aVby simply putting a filter behind them.
p377
aVNow you can see that changes the light that's coming through there, right?
p378
aVBecause now the light is going through a yellowish filter
p379
aVand then a purplish filter.
p380
aVI'm going to do the opposite on the left here.
p381
aVI'm going to put the middle nine under a purplish light.
p382
aa(lp383
VNow, some of you will have noticed that the consequence
p384
aVis that the light coming through those middle nine on the right,
p385
aVor your left, is exactly the same as the light
p386
aVcoming through the middle nine on your right.
p387
aVAgreed? Yes?
p388
aVOkay. So they are physically the same.
p389
aVLet's pull the covers off.
p390
aVNow remember \u2014
p391
aVyou know that the middle nine are exactly the same.
p392
aVDo they look the same?
p393
aVNo.
p394
aVThe question is, "Is that an illusion?"
p395
aVAnd I'll leave you with that.
p396
aa(lp397
VSo, thank you very much.

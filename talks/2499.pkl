VDo I look real to you?
p5
aVHope so.
p6
aVI have no idea if you're seeing this,
p7
aVbut I'm just going to look ahead and trust that you're there.
p8
aVI've drawn a semicircle in the sand in front of me
p9
aVso I don't walk past it and look like I'm floating in midair.
p10
aa(lp11
VRight now I'm standing
p12
aVin the open air,
p13
aVon a beach under a palm tree,
p14
aVin the exact spot where your stage used to be.
p15
aVI have 12 minutes with you.
p16
aVI set a limit.
p17
aVMy wife Navid once said
p18
aVthat infinite possibility is a creator's worst enemy.
p19
aVFor example, this dress: I'd asked her to design something
p20
aVthat a priest might have worn in 23rd-century Cairo.
p21
aVBut we only had three days to make it,
p22
aVand the only fabric we had
p23
aVwas an old duvet cover that another resident left behind.
p24
aVBut she did it, and it's perfect.
p25
aVAnd she looked at it and said,
p26
aV"Proof of concept \u2014 creation needs constraint."
p27
aVSo with these 12 minutes,
p28
aVI'm going to tell you about my greatest discovery.
p29
aa(lp30
VFor my whole life, my obsession has been eternal life,
p31
aVas I know it is so many of yours.
p32
aVYou may be happy to know that your research will pay off.
p33
aVI am 318 years old.
p34
aVThe average human lifespan is now 432 years,
p35
aVand my work has been to extend the human lifespan indefinitely.
p36
aVAnd I've never questioned that someday,
p37
aVwe'll reach a point where we'll be content.
p38
aVBut the opposite keeps happening:
p39
aVthe longer we live, the longer we want to live,
p40
aVthe less we want to die.
p41
aa(lp42
VWho can blame us?
p43
aVThe universe is so big.
p44
aVThere won't ever not be more to see.
p45
aVJust yesterday,
p46
aVI was reading about how you can take out a boat on Europa
p47
aVand sail from island to island all over the planet,
p48
aVand some of the islands have villages that you can stay and visit
p49
aVand sleep under the shadow of Jupiter.
p50
aVAnd then there's this other island where there's just one songwriter
p51
aVwho sits and plays mandolin for the ocean.
p52
aVAnd then there are others where there's no one
p53
aVand there never has been,
p54
aVand so you go just for the pleasure of touching your foot to sand
p55
aVthat no foot has ever touched before.
p56
aVYou could spend 400 years doing just that.
p57
aa(lp58
VRight now the Moon is rising in the Northeast.
p59
aVI can see the cities on it with my naked eye.
p60
aVThey're connected like nerve clusters:
p61
aVMariapolis on the South Pole, and Ramachandran on the Equator.
p62
aVAnd New Tehran in the Sea of Tranquility.
p63
aa(lp64
VThat's where Navid and I met.
p65
aVWe were both artists downtown.
p66
aVThe day we met, we were passing each other in Azadi Square,
p67
aVand we bumped shoulders.
p68
aVAnd I turned to apologize
p69
aVand she, without saying hello or introducing herself or anything,
p70
aVsaid, "Well, why do you think we didn't just pass through each other?"
p71
aVAnd first of all, I thought, "Who the hell are you?"
p72
aVBut second, the question annoyed me,
p73
aVbecause the answer is so simple.
p74
aVI said, "We didn't pass through each other
p75
aVbecause elementary particles have mass
p76
aVand because the space between elementary particles
p77
aVis filled with the binding energy that also has the properties of mass,
p78
aVand we've known that for 800 years."
p79
aVShe must have been in one of those moods
p80
aVwhere she likes to mess with strangers.
p81
aVOr maybe she was just flirting with me,
p82
aVbecause she looked at me and said, "I thought you'd say that.
p83
aVThink deeper."
p84
aVAnd then she took off her belt,
p85
aVthis belt that I'm wearing now,
p86
aVand she said,
p87
aV"Our universe is built so that particles have mass.
p88
aVWithout that basic constraint,
p89
aVwe'd have just passed right through each other at the speed of light
p90
aVand never even known."
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd that's how our romance began.
p93
aVNavid and I
p94
aVnever ran out of things to talk about.
p95
aVNever.
p96
aVIt was incredible.
p97
aVIt was like we were both heroes climbing up into a mountain range together
p98
aVand we kept arriving at new vistas,
p99
aVand these new, perfect constellations of words
p100
aVwould come out of us to describe them.
p101
aVAnd we'd forget them as soon as we made them,
p102
aVand throw them over our shoulder and go on to the next thing, on and up.
p103
aVOr one time, Navid said that our talk was like we were always making bread,
p104
aVand that we were always adding in a little more flour
p105
aVand a little more water,
p106
aVand folding it in and turning it over
p107
aVand never getting around to baking it.
p108
aa(lp109
VIf my obsession was eternal life, Navid's obsession was touch.
p110
aVShe had a genius for it.
p111
aVAll of her work revolved around it.
p112
aVMy body was like a canvas for her,
p113
aVand she would draw her fingertip down over my face so slowly
p114
aVthat I couldn't feel it moving.
p115
aVAnd she was obsessed with the exact moment
p116
aVwhen I would stop being able to tell the difference between her body and mine.
p117
aVOr she would just lie across me and dig her shoulder into mine
p118
aVand say, "Pilar, why does this feel so good?"
p119
aVI'd say, "I don't know!"
p120
aVAnd she always had a facetious answer for her facetious question,
p121
aVbut the answer I remember today is,
p122
aV"It feels good
p123
aVbecause the universe chose its constraints,
p124
aVand we are its art."
p125
aa(lp126
VIt's always funny what you think the future is going to be like
p127
aVversus what it turns out to be.
p128
aVIn your time, scientists thought humans could freeze themselves
p129
aVand wake up in the future.
p130
aVAnd they did \u2014 but then they died.
p131
aVIn your time, scientists thought humans could replace organs
p132
aVand extend life for hundreds of years.
p133
aVAnd they did,
p134
aVbut eventually, they died anyway.
p135
aVIn your time, Earth is the only place people live.
p136
aVIn my time, Earth is the place people come to die.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo when Navid started to show the signs,
p139
aVour friends assumed I would do what everyone does,
p140
aVwhich is say goodbye and send her to Earth,
p141
aVso that none of us would have to look at her
p142
aVor be around her or think about her and her ...
p143
aVfailure to keep living.
p144
aVMore than anything,
p145
aVthey didn't want to be around her actual physical body.
p146
aVThey kept referring to it as "declining,"
p147
aVeven though she herself was fascinated by it,
p148
aVthe changes it was going through,
p149
aVfollowing the rules of its nature day by day, independent of her will.
p150
aVI did send Navid to Earth.
p151
aVBut I came with her.
p152
aVI remember a friend of ours, just before we left, said,
p153
aV"I just think it's arrogant,
p154
aVlike the rules don't apply to you, like you think your love is that special."
p155
aVBut I did.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo, even here on Earth,
p158
aVI kept working on how to extend life.
p159
aVIt didn't occur to me
p160
aVthat there could be any other response.
p161
aVI kept going back to that thing that Navid said to me
p162
aVthat day in Azadi Square,
p163
aVthat without that basic constraint \u2014
p164
aVa universe that granted mass to matter \u2014
p165
aVwe would not exist.
p166
aVThat's one rule.
p167
aVAnother rule is that all mass is subject to entropy.
p168
aVAnd there is no way to be in this universe without mass.
p169
aVI know. I tried everything.
p170
aVI tried creating a photon box where the Higgs field was altered.
p171
aVI tried recording all subatomic movements in my body
p172
aVand replaying them on closed loop.
p173
aVNothing worked.
p174
aa(lp175
VBut my final innovation was to create a coil dimension
p176
aVwith the boundaries of a body in which time moved infinitely slower,
p177
aVbut whose projection would appear to move in normal time.
p178
aVThat body would then appear in our universe as a hologram \u2014
p179
aVhere but not here.
p180
aVWhen I realized I'd done it,
p181
aVI ran to her room,
p182
aVso happy to tell her I'd done it,
p183
aVmoving through space almost normally to all eyes,
p184
aVeven to my own,
p185
aVand went to lie down next to her,
p186
aVand forgot, and fell right through her.
p187
aVI'd found a way to eternal life,
p188
aVat the expense of the one thing Navid loved most,
p189
aVwhich was to touch and be touched.
p190
aVAnd she threw me out.
p191
aVI still got to watch, though.
p192
aa(lp193
VHumans live 400 years now,
p194
aVand we still die.
p195
aVAnd when death comes,
p196
aVthe dying still pick at their bedsheets,
p197
aVand their arms break out in blue and violet blooms on the insides,
p198
aVand their breaths get further and further apart,
p199
aVlike they're falling asleep.
p200
aa(lp201
VI've always thought that
p202
aVwhat gives a life meaning is adventure.
p203
aVAnd death is just a problem
p204
aVwe haven't discovered the solution to yet.
p205
aVBut maybe a life has meaning only because it ends.
p206
aVMaybe that's the paradox:
p207
aVconstraints don't constrain, they allow perfect freedom.
p208
aa(lp209
V(Sighs)
p210
aa(lp211
VThere was a thunderstorm here this morning.
p212
aVThere is another forecast for tonight,
p213
aVbut for now the sky is clear.
p214
aVI can't feel the wind here,
p215
aVbut I just asked one of the caretakers who passed by what it felt like,
p216
aVand she said it felt warm, like melted butter.
p217
aVAn answer worthy of my wife.
p218
aVI have to find my way back to the flesh.
p219
aVUntil then, I take up no space but the space you give me.

VLet's go south.
p5
aVAll of you are actually going south.
p6
aVThis is the direction of south, this way,
p7
aVand if you go 8,000 kilometers out of the back of this room,
p8
aVyou will come to as far south as you can go anywhere on Earth,
p9
aVthe Pole itself.
p10
aa(lp11
VNow, I am not an explorer.
p12
aVI'm not an environmentalist.
p13
aVI'm actually just a survivor,
p14
aVand these photographs that I'm showing you here are dangerous.
p15
aVThey are the ice melt of the South and North Poles.
p16
aVAnd ladies and gentlemen,
p17
aVwe need to listen to what these places are telling us,
p18
aVand if we don't, we will end up with our own survival situation
p19
aVhere on planet Earth.
p20
aa(lp21
VI have faced head-on these places,
p22
aVand to walk across a melting ocean of ice
p23
aVis without doubt the most frightening thing
p24
aVthat's ever happened to me.
p25
aa(lp26
VAntarctica is such a hopeful place.
p27
aVIt is protected by  the Antarctic Treaty, signed in 1959.
p28
aVIn 1991, a 50-year agreement was entered into
p29
aVthat stops any exploitation in Antarctica,
p30
aVand this agreement could be altered,
p31
aVchanged, modified, or even abandoned
p32
aVstarting in the year 2041.
p33
aVLadies and gentlemen,
p34
aVpeople already far up north from here in the Arctic
p35
aVare already taking advantage
p36
aVof this ice melt,
p37
aVtaking out resources from areas already that have been covered in ice
p38
aVfor the last 10, 20, 30,000,
p39
aV100,000 years.
p40
aVCan they not join the dots
p41
aVand think, "Why is the ice actually melting?"
p42
aa(lp43
VThis is such an amazing place,
p44
aVthe Antarctic, and I have worked hard
p45
aVfor the last 23 years on this mission
p46
aVto make sure that what's happening up here in the North
p47
aVdoes never happen,  cannot happen in the South.
p48
aa(lp49
VWhere did this all begin?
p50
aVIt began for me at the age of 11.
p51
aVCheck out that haircut.  It's a bit odd. (Laughter)
p52
aVAnd at the age of 11,  I was inspired by the real explorers
p53
aVto want to try to be the first to walk to both Poles.
p54
aVI found it incredibly inspiring
p55
aVthat the idea of becoming a polar traveler
p56
aVwent down pretty well with girls  at parties when I was at university.
p57
aVThat was a bit more inspiring.
p58
aVAnd after years, seven years of fundraising,
p59
aVseven years of being told no,
p60
aVseven years of being told by my family to seek counseling
p61
aVand psychiatric help,
p62
aVeventually three of us found ourselves marching to the South Geographic Pole
p63
aVon the longest unassisted march ever made anywhere on Earth in history.
p64
aVIn this photograph, we are standing in an area
p65
aVthe size of the United States of America,
p66
aVand we're on our own.
p67
aVWe have no radio  communications, no backup.
p68
aVBeneath our feet, 90 percent of all the world's ice,
p69
aV70 percent of all the world's fresh water.
p70
aVWe're standing on it.
p71
aVThis is the power of Antarctica.
p72
aa(lp73
VOn this journey, we faced the danger of crevasses,
p74
aVintense cold,
p75
aVso cold that sweat turns to ice inside your clothing,
p76
aVyour teeth can crack,
p77
aVwater can freeze in your eyes.
p78
aVLet's just say it's a bit chilly. (Laughter)
p79
aVAnd after 70 desperate days, we arrive at the South Pole.
p80
aVWe had done it.
p81
aVBut something happened to me on that 70-day journey in 1986
p82
aVthat brought me here, and it hurt.
p83
aVMy eyes changed color in 70 days through damage.
p84
aVOur faces blistered out.
p85
aVThe skin ripped off and we wondered why.
p86
aVAnd when we got home, we were told by NASA
p87
aVthat a hole in the ozone had been discovered
p88
aVabove the South Pole,
p89
aVand we'd walked underneath it the same year it had been discovered.
p90
aVUltraviolet rays down, hit the ice, bounced back, fried out the eyes,
p91
aVripped off our faces.
p92
aVIt was a bit of a shock \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p93
aVand it started me thinking.
p94
aa(lp95
VIn 1989, we now head north.
p96
aVSixty days, every step away from the safety of land
p97
aVacross a frozen ocean.
p98
aVIt was desperately cold again.
p99
aVHere's me coming in from washing naked at -60 Celsius.
p100
aVAnd if anybody ever says to you, "I am cold" \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p101
aVif they look like this,  they are cold, definitely.
p102
aV(Applause)
p103
aa(lp104
VAnd 1,000 kilometers away from the safety of land,
p105
aVdisaster strikes.
p106
aVThe Arctic Ocean melts beneath our feet four months before it ever had in history,
p107
aVand we're 1,000 kilometers from safety.
p108
aVThe ice is crashing around us, grinding, and I'm thinking, "Are we going to die?"
p109
aVBut something clicked in my head on this day,
p110
aVas I realized we, as a world, are in a survival situation,
p111
aVand that feeling has never gone away for 25 long years.
p112
aVBack then, we had to march or die.
p113
aVAnd we're not some TV survivor program.
p114
aVWhen things go wrong for us, it's life or death,
p115
aVand our brave African-American Daryl,
p116
aVwho would become the first American to walk to the North Pole,
p117
aVhis heel dropped off  from frostbite 200 klicks out.
p118
aVHe must keep going, he does,
p119
aVand after 60 days on the ice, we stood at the North Pole.
p120
aVWe had done it.
p121
aVYes, I became the first person in history stupid enough to walk to both Poles,
p122
aVbut it was our success.
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd sadly, on return home,
p125
aVit was not all fun.
p126
aVI became very low.
p127
aVTo succeed at something is often harder than actually making it happen.
p128
aVI was empty, lonely, financially destroyed.
p129
aVI was without hope,
p130
aVbut hope came in the form of the great Jacques Cousteau,
p131
aVand he inspired me to take on  the 2041 mission.
p132
aVBeing Jacques, he gave me clear instructions:
p133
aVEngage the world leaders, talk to industry and business,
p134
aVand above all, Rob, inspire young people,
p135
aVbecause they will choose the future of the preservation of Antarctica.
p136
aa(lp137
VFor the world leaders, we've been to every world Earth Summit,
p138
aVall three of them, with our brave yacht, 2041,
p139
aVtwice to Rio, once in '92, once in 2012,
p140
aVand for the Earth Summit in Johannesburg,
p141
aVwe made the longest overland voyage ever made with a yacht,
p142
aV13,000 kilometers around the whole of Southern Africa
p143
aVdoing our best to inspire over a million young people in person
p144
aVabout 2041 and about their environment.
p145
aa(lp146
VFor the last 11 years, we have taken over 1,000 people,
p147
aVpeople from industry and business, women and men from companies,
p148
aVstudents from all over the world, down to Antarctica,
p149
aVand during those missions, we've managed to pull out
p150
aVover 1,500 tons of twisted metal left in Antarctica.
p151
aVThat took eight years, and I'm so proud of it
p152
aVbecause we recycled all of it  back here in South America.
p153
aVI have been inspired ever since I could walk
p154
aVto recycle by my mum.
p155
aVHere she is, and my mum \u2014
p156
aV(Applause) \u2014
p157
aVmy mum is still recycling,
p158
aVand as she is in her 100th year, isn't that fantastic?
p159
aV(Applause)
p160
aVAnd when \u2014 I love my mum.
p161
aV(Laughter)
p162
aVBut when Mum was born,
p163
aVthe population of our planet was only 1.8 billion people,
p164
aVand talking in terms of billions,
p165
aVwe have taken young people from industry and business
p166
aVfrom India, from China.
p167
aVThese are game-changing nations, and will be hugely important
p168
aVin the decision about the preservation of the Antarctic.
p169
aVUnbelievably, we've engaged and inspired women to come from the Middle East,
p170
aVoften for the first time they've  represented their nations in Antarctica.
p171
aVFantastic people, so inspired.
p172
aVTo look after Antarctica,
p173
aVyou've got to first engage people with this extraordinary place,
p174
aVform a relationship, form a bond,
p175
aVform some love.
p176
aVIt is such a privilege to go to Antarctica,
p177
aVI can't tell you.
p178
aVI feel so lucky,
p179
aVand I've been 35 times in my life,
p180
aVand all those people who come with us return home as great champions,
p181
aVnot only for Antarctica,
p182
aVbut for local issues back in their own nations.
p183
aa(lp184
VLet's go back to where we began: the ice melt of the North and South Poles.
p185
aVAnd it's not good news.
p186
aVNASA informed us six months ago
p187
aVthat the Western Antarctic Ice Shelf is now disintegrating.
p188
aVHuge areas of ice \u2014
p189
aVlook how big Antarctica is even compared to here \u2014
p190
aVHuge areas of ice  are breaking off from Antarctica,
p191
aVthe size of small nations.
p192
aVAnd NASA have calculated that the sea level will rise,
p193
aVit is definite,
p194
aVby one meter in the next 100 years,
p195
aVthe same time that my mum has been on planet Earth.
p196
aVIt's going to happen,
p197
aVand I've realized that  the preservation of Antarctica
p198
aVand our survival here on Earth are linked.
p199
aVAnd there is a very simple solution.
p200
aVIf we are using more renewable energy in the real world,
p201
aVif we are being more efficient with the energy here,
p202
aVrunning our energy mix in a cleaner way,
p203
aVthere will be no financial reason to go and exploit Antarctica.
p204
aVIt won't make financial sense,
p205
aVand if we manage our energy better, we also may be able to slow down,
p206
aVmaybe even stop,
p207
aVthis great ice melt that threatens us.
p208
aa(lp209
VIt's a big challenge, and what is our response to it?
p210
aVWe've got to go back one last time,
p211
aVand at the end of next year,
p212
aVwe will go back to the South Geographic Pole,
p213
aVwhere we arrived 30 years ago on foot,
p214
aVand retrace our steps of 1,600 kilometers,
p215
aVbut this time only using renewable energy to survive.
p216
aVWe will walk across those icecaps, which far down below are melting,
p217
aVhopefully inspiring some solutions on that issue.
p218
aa(lp219
VThis is my son, Barney.
p220
aVHe is coming with me.
p221
aVHe is committed to walking side by side with his father,
p222
aVand what he will do is to translate these messages
p223
aVand inspire these messages to the minds of future young leaders.
p224
aVI'm extremely proud of him.
p225
aVGood on him, Barney.
p226
aa(lp227
VLadies and gentlemen,  a survivor \u2014 and I'm good \u2014
p228
aVa survivor sees a problem and doesn't go, "Whatever."
p229
aVA survivor sees a problem and deals with that problem
p230
aVbefore it becomes a threat.
p231
aVWe have 27 years to preserve the Antarctic.
p232
aVWe all own it.
p233
aVWe all have responsibility.
p234
aVThe fact that nobody owns it  maybe means that we can succeed.
p235
aVAntarctica is a moral line in the snow,
p236
aVand on one side of that line we should fight,
p237
aVfight hard for this one beautiful, pristine place left alone on Earth.
p238
aVI know it's possible.
p239
aVWe are going to do it.
p240
aVAnd I'll leave you with these words from Goethe.
p241
aVI've tried to live by them.
p242
aa(lp243
V"If you can do, or dream you can,
p244
aVbegin it now,
p245
aVfor boldness has genius, power and magic in it."
p246
aa(lp247
VGood luck to you all.
p248
aa(lp249
VThank you very much.

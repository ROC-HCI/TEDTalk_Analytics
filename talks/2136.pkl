VI haven't told many people this,
p5
aVbut in my head, I've got
p6
aVthousands of secret worlds all going on
p7
aVall at the same time.
p8
aVI am also autistic.
p9
aa(lp10
VPeople tend to diagnose autism
p11
aVwith really specific  check-box descriptions,
p12
aVbut in reality, it's a whole variation as to what we're like.
p13
aVFor instance, my little brother,
p14
aVhe's very severely autistic.
p15
aVHe's nonverbal. He can't talk at all.
p16
aVBut I love to talk.
p17
aVPeople often associate autism
p18
aVwith liking maths and  science and nothing else,
p19
aVbut I know so many autistic people
p20
aVwho love being creative.
p21
aVBut that is a stereotype,
p22
aVand the stereotypes of things
p23
aVare often, if not always, wrong.
p24
aVFor instance, a lot of people
p25
aVthink autism and think  "Rain Man" immediately.
p26
aVThat's the common belief,
p27
aVthat every single autistic  person is Dustin Hoffman,
p28
aVand that's not true.
p29
aa(lp30
VBut that's not just with  autistic people, either.
p31
aVI've seen it with LGBTQ people,
p32
aVwith women, with POC people.
p33
aVPeople are so afraid of variety
p34
aVthat they try to fit everything  into a tiny little box
p35
aVwith really specific labels.
p36
aVThis is something that actually
p37
aVhappened to me in real life:
p38
aVI googled "autistic people are ..."
p39
aVand it comes up with suggestions
p40
aVas to what you're going to type.
p41
aVI googled "autistic people are ..."
p42
aVand the top result was "demons."
p43
aVThat is the first thing that people think
p44
aVwhen they think autism.
p45
aVThey know.
p46
aV(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VOne of the things I can do  because I'm autistic \u2014
p49
aVit's an ability rather than a disability \u2014
p50
aVis I've got a very, very vivid imagination.
p51
aVLet me explain it to you a bit.
p52
aVIt's like I'm walking in two  worlds most of the time.
p53
aVThere's the real world,  the world that we all share,
p54
aVand there's the world in my mind,
p55
aVand the world in my mind  is often so much more real
p56
aVthan the real world.
p57
aVLike, it's very easy for  me to let my mind loose
p58
aVbecause I don't try and fit  myself into a tiny little box.
p59
aVThat's one of the best  things about being autistic.
p60
aVYou don't have the urge to do that.
p61
aVYou find what you want to do,
p62
aVyou find a way to do it,  and you get on with it.
p63
aVIf I was trying to fit myself into a box,
p64
aVI wouldn't be here, I  wouldn't have achieved
p65
aVhalf the things that I have now.
p66
aVThere are problems, though.
p67
aVThere are problems with being autistic,
p68
aVand there are problems with having too much imagination.
p69
aVSchool can be a problem in general,
p70
aVbut having also to explain to a teacher
p71
aVon a daily basis
p72
aVthat their lesson is inexplicably dull
p73
aVand you are secretly taking refuge
p74
aVin a world inside your head in  which you are not in that lesson,
p75
aVthat adds to your list of problems.
p76
aV(Laughter)
p77
aVAlso, when my imagination takes hold,
p78
aVmy body takes on a life of its own.
p79
aVWhen something very exciting happens in my inner world,
p80
aVI've just got to run.
p81
aVI've got to rock backwards and forwards,
p82
aVor sometimes scream.
p83
aVThis gives me so much energy,
p84
aVand I've got to have an  outlet for all that energy.
p85
aVBut I've done that ever  since I was a child,
p86
aVever since I was a tiny little girl.
p87
aVAnd my parents thought it was  cute, so they didn't bring it up,
p88
aVbut when I got into school,
p89
aVthey didn't really agree that it was cute.
p90
aVIt can be that people  don't want to be friends
p91
aVwith the girl that starts  screaming in an algebra lesson.
p92
aVAnd this doesn't normally  happen in this day and age,
p93
aVbut it can be that people don't want  to be friends with the autistic girl.
p94
aVIt can be that people  don't want to associate
p95
aVwith anyone who won't  or can't fit themselves
p96
aVinto a box that's labeled normal.
p97
aVBut that's fine with me,
p98
aVbecause it sorts the wheat from the chaff,
p99
aVand I can find which people  are genuine and true
p100
aVand I can pick these people as my friends.
p101
aa(lp102
VBut if you think about it, what is normal?
p103
aVWhat does it mean?
p104
aVImagine if that was the best  compliment you ever received.
p105
aV"Wow, you are really normal."
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aVBut compliments are,
p108
aV"you are extraordinary"
p109
aVor "you step outside the box."
p110
aVIt's "you're amazing."
p111
aVSo if people want to be these things,
p112
aVwhy are so many people  striving to be normal?
p113
aVWhy are people pouring their  brilliant individual light into a mold?
p114
aVPeople are so afraid of variety  that they try and force everyone,
p115
aVeven people who don't want  to or can't, to become normal.
p116
aVThere are camps for LGBTQ people
p117
aVor autistic people to try and  make them this "normal,"
p118
aVand that's terrifying that people  would do that in this day and age.
p119
aa(lp120
VAll in all, I wouldn't trade my autism and my imagination for the world.
p121
aVBecause I am autistic,
p122
aVI've presented documentaries to the BBC,
p123
aVI'm in the midst of writing a book,
p124
aVI'm doing this \u2014 this is fantastic \u2014
p125
aVand one of the best  things that I've achieved,
p126
aVthat I consider to have achieved,
p127
aVis I've found ways of communicating
p128
aVwith my little brother and sister,
p129
aVwho as I've said are nonverbal.  They can't speak.
p130
aVAnd people would often write off someone who's nonverbal,
p131
aVbut that's silly, because  my little brother and sister
p132
aVare the best siblings that  you could ever hope for.
p133
aVThey're just the best,  and I love them so much
p134
aVand I care about them  more than anything else.
p135
aVI'm going to leave you with one question:
p136
aVIf we can't get inside the person's minds,
p137
aVno matter if they're autistic or not,
p138
aVinstead of punishing anything that strays from normal,
p139
aVwhy not celebrate uniqueness
p140
aVand cheer every time someone unleashes their imagination?
p141
aa(lp142
VThank you.

She found the opportunity to do so when her family was invited to do a local news segment on her mother&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s books, which featured Rosie&rsquo;s illustrations. Her lack of inhibition made her a natural presenter, and she was asked to host BBC Newsround&rsquo;s special program <a href=\\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15689138\\" target=\\"_blank\\">&ldquo;My Autism and Me,&rdquo;</a> bringing her a much wider audience and an Emmy Kid&rsquo;s Award.

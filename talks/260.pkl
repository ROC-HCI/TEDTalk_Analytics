VI started juggling a long time ago,
p5
aVbut long before that, I was a golfer, and that's what I was, a golfer.
p6
aVAnd as a golfer and as a kid,
p7
aVone of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores,
p8
aVthat I sort of lived my whole life, is process.
p9
aVAnd it's the process of learning things.
p10
aVOne of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer, but he was lefty.
p11
aVAnd he had a real passion for golf,
p12
aVand he also created this whole mythology
p13
aVabout Ben Hogan and various things.
p14
aVWell, I learned a lot about interesting things
p15
aVthat I knew nothing about at the time, but grew to know stuff about.
p16
aVAnd that was the mythology of skill.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo, one of the things that I love to do is to explore skill.
p19
aVAnd since Richard put me on this whole thing with music \u2014
p20
aVI'm supposed to actually be doing a project with Tod Machover
p21
aVwith the MIT Media Lab \u2014 it relates a lot to music.
p22
aVBut Tod couldn't come and the project is sort of somewhere,
p23
aVI'm not sure whether it's happening the way we thought, or not.
p24
aVBut I'm going to explore skill, and juggling,
p25
aVand basically visual music, I guess.
p26
aVOK, you can start the music, thanks.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Music)
p29
aa(lp30
V(Applause)
p31
aa(lp32
VThanks. Thank you. Now, juggling can be a lot of fun;
p33
aVplay with skill and play with space, play with rhythm.
p34
aVAnd you can turn the mike on now. I'm going to do a couple of pieces.
p35
aVI do a big piece in a triangle
p36
aVand these are three sections from it.
p37
aVPart of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space
p38
aVusing not just my hands \u2014 because a lot of juggling is hand-oriented \u2014
p39
aVbut using the rhythm of my body and feet,
p40
aVand controlling the balls with my feet.
p41
aa(lp42
V(Applause)
p43
aa(lp44
VThanks. Now, this next section was an attempt to explore space.
p45
aVYou see, I think Richard said something about people that are against something.
p46
aVWell, a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff.
p47
aVWell, I kind of, from my childhood and golf and all that,
p48
aVit's a process of joining with forces.
p49
aVAnd so what I'd like to do is try to figure out
p50
aVhow to join with the space through the technique.
p51
aVSo juggling gravity \u2014 up, down.
p52
aVIf you figure out what up and down really are,
p53
aVit's a complex physical set of skills
p54
aVto be able to throw a ball down and up and everything,
p55
aVbut then you add in sideways.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Applause)
p58
aa(lp59
VNow, I look at it somewhat as a way \u2014 when you learn juggling
p60
aVwhat you learn is how to feel with your eyes, and see with your hands
p61
aVbecause you're not looking at your hands,
p62
aVyou're looking at where the balls are or you're looking at the audience.
p63
aVSo this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm,
p64
aVwith the obvious reference to the feet,
p65
aVbut it's also time \u2014 where the feet were, where the balls were.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Applause)
p68
aa(lp69
VThanks. So, visual music: rhythm and complexity.
p70
aVI'm going to build towards complexity now.
p71
aVJuggling three balls is simple and normal.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VExcuse me.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VWe're jugglers, OK. And remember, you're transposing,
p80
aVyou're getting into a subculture here.
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd juggling \u2014 the balls cross and all that.
p85
aVOK, if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel lines
p86
aVof different heights, but then hopefully even rhythm.
p87
aVAnd you can change the rhythm \u2014 good, Michael.
p88
aVYou can change the rhythm, if you get out of the lights.
p89
aVOK? Change the rhythm, so it's even.
p90
aVOr you can go back and change the height. Now, skill.
p91
aVBut you're boxed in, if you can only do it up and down that way.
p92
aVSo, you've got to go after the space down there.
p93
aVOK, then you've got to combine them,
p94
aVbecause then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you.
p95
aVAnd then you get crazy.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Applause)
p98
aa(lp99
VNow, I'm actually going to ask you to try something,
p100
aVso you've got to pay attention. Complexity:
p101
aVif you spend enough time doing something, time slows down
p102
aVor your skill increases, so your perceptions change.
p103
aVIt's learning skills \u2014 like being in a high-speed car crash.
p104
aVThings slow down as you learn, as you learn, as you learn.
p105
aVYou may not be able to affect it, it almost drifts on you. It goes.
p106
aVBut that's the closest approximation I can have to it.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo, complexity. Now, how many here are jugglers?
p109
aVOK, so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this.
p110
aVOK? And whoever laughed there \u2014
p111
aVyou understood it completely, right?
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VNo, it looks like a mess. It looks like a mess with a guy there,
p116
aVwho's got his hands around that mess, OK.
p117
aVWell, that's what juggling is about, right?
p118
aVIt's being able to do something that other people can't do or can't understand.
p119
aVAll right. So, that's one way of doing it, which is five balls down.
p120
aVOK? Another way is the outside.
p121
aVAnd you could play with the rhythm.
p122
aVSame pattern.
p123
aVMake it faster and smaller.
p124
aVMake it wider.
p125
aVMake it narrower.
p126
aVBring it back up.
p127
aVOK. It's done. Thanks.
p128
aa(lp129
V(Applause)
p130
aa(lp131
VNow, what I wanted to get to is that you're all very bright, very tactile.
p132
aVI have no idea how computer-oriented or three-dimensionally-oriented you are,
p133
aVbut let's try something.
p134
aVOK, so since you all don't understand what the five-ball pattern is,
p135
aVI'm going to give you a little clue.
p136
aVEnough of a clue? So, you get the pattern, right? OK.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VYou're not getting off that easy. All right?
p141
aVNow, do me a favor: follow the ball that I ask you to follow.
p142
aVGreen.
p143
aVYellow.
p144
aVPink.
p145
aVWhite.
p146
aVOK, you can do that? Yeah? OK.
p147
aa(lp148
VNow, let's actually learn something.
p149
aVActually, let me put you in that area of learning, which is very insecure.
p150
aVYou want to do it? Yeah? OK.
p151
aVHands out in front of you. Palms up, together.
p152
aVWhat you're going to learn is this.
p153
aa(lp154
V(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
VOK? So what I want you to do is just listen to me and do it.
p157
aVIndex finger, middle finger, ring, little.
p158
aVLittle, ring, middle, index. And then open.
p159
aVFinger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.
p160
aVA little bit faster.
p161
aVFinger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.
p162
aVFinger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.
p163
aa(lp164
V(Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
VAll right. A lot of different learning processes going on in here.
p167
aa(lp168
V(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VOne learning process that I see is this \u2014
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VOK. Another learning process that I see is this \u2014
p175
aa(lp176
V(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
VOK. So, everybody take a deep breath in, breath out. OK.
p179
aVNow, one more time, and \u2014
p180
aVfinger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Open.
p181
aVFinger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. OK.
p182
aVShake your hands out.
p183
aa(lp184
VNow, I assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer.
p185
aVOK? So, what you're doing is, you're going la, la, la,
p186
aVand you're getting this. OK?
p187
aVSo that's exactly what I'm going to ask you to do,
p188
aVbut in a slightly different way. You're going to combine it.
p189
aVSo what I want you to do is \u2014 fingers.
p190
aVI'll tell you what to do with your fingers, same thing.
p191
aVBut I want you to do is also, with your eyes,
p192
aVis follow the colored ball that I ask you to follow.
p193
aa(lp194
V(Laughter)
p195
aa(lp196
VOK? Here we go.
p197
aVSo, we're going to start off looking at the white ball \u2014
p198
aVand I'm going to tell you which color,
p199
aVand I'm also going to tell you to go with your fingers. OK?
p200
aVSo white ball and \u2014
p201
aVfinger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Pink.
p202
aVFinger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Green.
p203
aVFinger, finger, finger, finger. Yellow.
p204
aVFinger, finger, finger, pink or finger.
p205
aVPink, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.
p206
aVAll right.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Applause)
p209
aa(lp210
VHow did you do? Well? OK. The reason I wanted you to do this is
p211
aVbecause that's actually what most people face throughout their lives,
p212
aVa moment of learning, a moment of challenge.
p213
aVIt's a moment that you can't make sense of.
p214
aVWhy the hell should I learn this? OK?
p215
aVDoes it really have anything to do with anything in my life?
p216
aVYou know, I can't decipher \u2014 is it fun? Is it challenging? Am I supposed to cheat?
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VYou know, what are you supposed to do?
p221
aVYou've got somebody up here who is the operative principle
p222
aVof doing that for his whole life. OK?
p223
aVTrying to figure that stuff out. But is it going to get you anywhere?
p224
aVIt's just a moment. That's all it is, a moment. OK?
p225
aVI'm going to change the script for one second. Just let me do this.
p226
aVI don't need music for it. Talking about time in a moment.
p227
aVThere's a piece that I recently developed which was all about that,
p228
aVa moment. And what I do as a creative artist
p229
aVis I develop vocabularies or languages of moving objects.
p230
aa(lp231
VWhat I've done for you here, I developed a lot of those tricks
p232
aVand I put the choreography together,
p233
aVbut they're not original techniques.
p234
aVNow, I'm going to start showing you some original techniques
p235
aVthat come from the work that I've developed. OK?
p236
aVSo, a moment, how would you define a moment?
p237
aVWell, as a juggler, what I wanted to do was create something
p238
aVthat was representational of a moment.
p239
aa(lp240
VAhhh.
p241
aVAll right, I'm going to get on my knees and do it.
p242
aVSo, a moment.
p243
aa(lp244
V(Rattling)
p245
aa(lp246
VOK? And then, what I did as a juggler was say,
p247
aVOK, what can I do to make that something
p248
aVthat is dependent on something else, another dynamic.
p249
aa(lp250
V(Rattling)
p251
aa(lp252
VSo, a moment.
p253
aa(lp254
V(Rattling)
p255
aa(lp256
VAnother moment.
p257
aa(lp258
V(Rattling)
p259
aa(lp260
VExcuse me, still getting there. A moment that travels.
p261
aa(lp262
V(Rattling)
p263
aa(lp264
VA moment \u2014 no, we'll try that again. It separates, and comes back together.
p265
aVTime. How can you look at time?
p266
aVAnd what do you dedicate it to, in exploring a particular thing?
p267
aVWell, obviously, there's something in here,
p268
aVand you can all have a guess as to what it is.
p269
aVThere's a mystery. There's a mystery in the moment.
p270
aVAnd it has to settle. And then it's dependent on something else.
p271
aVAnd then it comes to rest. Just a little thing about time.
p272
aa(lp273
VNow, this has expanded into a much bigger piece,
p274
aVbecause I use ramps of different parabolas that I roll the balls on
p275
aVwhile I'm keeping time with this.
p276
aVBut I just thought I'd talk about a moment.
p277
aa(lp278
V(Applause)
p279
aa(lp280
VAll right. OK. Can we show the video of the triangle?
p281
aVAre we ready to do that? Yes?
p282
aVThis is the piece that I told you about.
p283
aVIt's a much bigger piece that I do exploring the space of a geometric triangle.
p284
aa(lp285
V(Applause)
p286
aa(lp287
VThanks. The only thing I'll say about the last session is,
p288
aVyou ever try juggling and driving the car with your knees
p289
aVat 120 miles an hour?
p290
aa(lp291
V(Laughter)
p292
aa(lp293
VThe only other thing is, it was a real shock.
p294
aVI always drove motorcycles. And when I bought my first car, it shocked me
p295
aVthat it cost three times more than my parents' house. Interesting.
p296
aa(lp297
VAnyway, balance:
p298
aVconstant movement to find an approach to stillness.
p299
aVCheating.
p300
aa(lp301
V(Laughter)
p302
aa(lp303
VBalance: making up the rules so you can't cheat,
p304
aVso you learn to approach stillness with different parts of your body.
p305
aVTo have a conversation with it. To speak. To listen.
p306
aa(lp307
V(Laughter)
p308
aa(lp309
VHup. Now, it's dependent on rhythm,
p310
aVand keeping a center of balance. When it falls, going underneath.
p311
aVSo, there's a rhythm to it.
p312
aVThe rhythm can get much smaller.
p313
aVAs your skill increases, you learn to find those tinier spaces,
p314
aVthose tinier movements. Thanks.
p315
aa(lp316
V(Applause)
p317
aa(lp318
VNow, I'm going to show you the beginnings of a piece
p319
aVthat is about balance in some ways, and also \u2014
p320
aVoh, actually, if you're bored, not here, here's one use for it.
p321
aa(lp322
V(Laughter)
p323
aa(lp324
VYou can go with the "Sticks One" music.
p325
aa(lp326
V(Music)
p327
aa(lp328
V(Applause)
p329
aa(lp330
VThanks. That has a certain kind of balance to it, which is all about plumb.
p331
aVI apprenticed with a carpenter and learned about plumb, square and level.
p332
aVAnd they influenced that, and this next piece, which I'll do a little segment of.
p333
aV"Two Sticks," you can go with it. Thanks.
p334
aVWhich is again exploring space, or the lines in space.
p335
aa(lp336
V(Music)
p337
aa(lp338
V(Applause)
p339
aa(lp340
VWorking with space and the lines in space in a different way.
p341
aVOh, let's see here.
p342
aa(lp343
V(Applause)
p344
aa(lp345
VSo, I'll come back to that in a second. But working with one ball,
p346
aVnow, what if you attach something to it, or change it.
p347
aVThis is a little thing that I made
p348
aVbecause I really like the idea of curves and balls together.
p349
aVAnd then creating space and the rhythm of space,
p350
aVusing the surface of the balls, the surface of the arms.
p351
aVJust a little toy. Which leads me to the next thing,
p352
aVwhich is \u2014
p353
aVwhat have I got here? OK. All right.
p354
aa(lp355
VI'm actually leading up to something,
p356
aVthe newest thing that I'm working on. This is not it.
p357
aVThis is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape.
p358
aa(lp359
V(Applause)
p360
aa(lp361
VNow, what I just did was I worked with the mathematics \u2014
p362
aVthe diameter and the circumference.
p363
aVSometimes these pieces are mathematical, in that way
p364
aVthat I look at a shape and say, what about if I use this and this and this.
p365
aVSometimes what happens in life affects my choice
p366
aVof objects that I try to work with.
p367
aa(lp368
VThe next piece that I'm going to do \u2014 which is the cylinders piece,
p369
aVif you want to get that up \u2014
p370
aVit has to do with cylinder seals from about 5,000 years ago,
p371
aVwhich were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay
p372
aVwith all sorts of great designs. I love ceramics and all of that.
p373
aVIt's a combination of that, the beauty of that, the shape,
p374
aVand the stories that were involved in it,
p375
aVas well as the fact that they protected the contents.
p376
aa(lp377
VThe second influence on this piece came from recycling
p378
aVand looking into a tin can recycling bin
p379
aVand seeing all that beautiful emptiness.
p380
aVSo, if you want to go with the music for cylinders.
p381
aa(lp382
V(Music)
p383
aa(lp384
V(Applause)
p385
aa(lp386
VTalking about geometry and everything,
p387
aVif you take the circle and you split it in half \u2014
p388
aVcan you run "S-Curve music?"
p389
aVI'm going to do just a short version of it.
p390
aVCircles split in half and rotated, and mythology.
p391
aa(lp392
V(Music)
p393
aa(lp394
V(Applause)
p395
aa(lp396
VAnyway, that piece also has a kinetic sculpture in the middle of it,
p397
aVand I dance around a small stage so \u2014
p398
aVtwo minutes, just to end? The latest piece that I'm working on \u2014
p399
aVwhat I love is that I never know what I'm working on, why I'm working on it.
p400
aVThey're not ideas, they're instincts.
p401
aVAnd the latest thing that I'm working on \u2014
p402
aa(lp403
V(Clattering) \u2014
p404
aa(lp405
Vis something really \u2014 I don't know what it is yet.
p406
aVAnd that's good. I like not to know for as long as possible.
p407
aVWell, because then it tells me the truth,
p408
aVinstead of me imposing the truth.
p409
aVAnd what it is, is working with both positive and negative space
p410
aVbut also with these curves.
p411
aVAnd what it involves,
p412
aVand I don't know if my hands are too beaten up to do it or not,
p413
aVbut I'll do a little bit of it.
p414
aa(lp415
VIt initially started off with me stacking these things,
p416
aVbunches of them, and then playing with the sense of space,
p417
aVof filling in the space. And then it started changing,
p418
aVand become folding on themselves.
p419
aVAnd then changing levels.
p420
aVBecause my attempt is to make visual instruments,
p421
aVnot to just make \u2014 I'll try one other thing.
p422
aVFor work in three dimensions, with your perceptions of space and time.
p423
aVNow, I don't know exactly where it's going,
p424
aVbut I've got a bit of effort involved in this thing.
p425
aVAnd it's going to change as I go through it.
p426
aVBut I really like it, it feels right.
p427
aVThis may not be the right shape, and \u2014 look at this shape,
p428
aVand then I'll show you the first design I ever put to it,
p429
aVjust to see, just to play,
p430
aVbecause I love all different kinds of things to play with.
p431
aVLet's see here.
p432
aVTo work with the positive and negative in a different way.
p433
aVAnd to change, and to change.
p434
aa(lp435
VSo, I'm off in my new direction with this to explore rhythm and space.
p436
aVWe'll see what I come up with. Thanks for having me.

VI heard this amazing story about Miuccia Prada.
p5
aVShe's an Italian fashion designer.
p6
aVShe goes to this vintage store in Paris
p7
aVwith a friend of hers.
p8
aVShe's rooting around, she finds this one jacket by Balenciaga \u2014
p9
aVshe loves it.
p10
aVShe's turning it inside out.
p11
aVShe's looking at the seams. She's looking at the construction.
p12
aVHer friend says, "Buy it already."
p13
aVShe said, "I'll buy it, but I'm also going to replicate it."
p14
aVNow, the academics in this audience may think,
p15
aV"Well, that sounds like plagiarism."
p16
aVBut to a fashionista, what it really is
p17
aVis a sign of Prada's genius:
p18
aVthat she can root through the history of fashion
p19
aVand pick the one jacket
p20
aVthat doesn't need to be changed by one iota,
p21
aVand to be current and to be now.
p22
aa(lp23
VYou might also be asking whether it's possible
p24
aVthat this is illegal for her to do this.
p25
aVWell, it turns out that it's actually not illegal.
p26
aVIn the fashion industry, there's very little
p27
aVintellectual property protection.
p28
aVThey have trademark protection,
p29
aVbut no copyright protection
p30
aVand no patent protection to speak of.
p31
aVAll they have, really, is trademark protection,
p32
aVand so it means that anybody
p33
aVcould copy any garment
p34
aVon any person in this room
p35
aVand sell it as their own design.
p36
aVThe only thing that they can't copy
p37
aVis the actual trademark label
p38
aVwithin that piece of apparel.
p39
aVThat's one reason that you see logos
p40
aVsplattered all over these products.
p41
aVIt's because it's a lot harder for knock-off artists
p42
aVto knock off these designs
p43
aVbecause they can't knock off the logo.
p44
aVBut if you go to Santee Alley, yeah.
p45
aV(Laughter) Well, yeah.
p46
aVCanal Street, I know.
p47
aVAnd sometimes these are fun, right?
p48
aa(lp49
VNow, the reason for this, the reason that the fashion industry
p50
aVdoesn't have any copyright protection
p51
aVis because the courts decided long ago
p52
aVthat apparel is too utilitarian
p53
aVto qualify for copyright protection.
p54
aVThey didn't want a handful of designers
p55
aVowning the seminal building blocks of our clothing.
p56
aVAnd then everybody else would have to license this cuff or this sleeve
p57
aVbecause Joe Blow owns it.
p58
aVBut too utilitarian? I mean is that the way you think of fashion?
p59
aVThis is Vivienne Westwood. No!
p60
aVWe think of it as maybe too silly,
p61
aVtoo unnecessary.
p62
aa(lp63
VNow, those of you who are familiar with the logic
p64
aVbehind copyright protection \u2014
p65
aVwhich is that without ownership, there is no incentive to innovate \u2014
p66
aVmight be really surprised
p67
aVby both the critical success of the fashion industry
p68
aVand the economic success of this industry.
p69
aVWhat I'm going to argue today is that
p70
aVbecause there's no copyright protection
p71
aVin the fashion industry,
p72
aVfashion designers have actually been able to elevate
p73
aVutilitarian design,
p74
aVthings to cover our naked bodies,
p75
aVinto something that we consider art.
p76
aVBecause there's no copyright protection
p77
aVin this industry,
p78
aVthere's a very open and creative
p79
aVecology of creativity.
p80
aa(lp81
VUnlike their creative brothers and sisters,
p82
aVwho are sculptors or photographers
p83
aVor filmmakers or musicians,
p84
aVfashion designers can sample
p85
aVfrom all their peers' designs.
p86
aVThey can take any element from any garment
p87
aVfrom the history of fashion
p88
aVand incorporate it into their own design.
p89
aVThey're also notorious for riffing off of the zeitgeist.
p90
aVAnd here, I suspect,
p91
aVthey were influenced by the costumes in Avatar.
p92
aVMaybe just a little.
p93
aVCan't copyright a costume either.
p94
aa(lp95
VNow, fashion designers have
p96
aVthe broadest palette imaginable
p97
aVin this creative industry.
p98
aVThis wedding dress here
p99
aVis actually made of sporks,
p100
aVand this dress is actually made of aluminum.
p101
aVI've heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind chimes
p102
aVas they walk through.
p103
aVSo, one of the magical side effects
p104
aVof having a culture of copying,
p105
aVwhich is really what it is,
p106
aVis the establishment of trends.
p107
aVPeople think this is a magical thing. How does it happen?
p108
aVWell, it's because it's legal for people to copy one another.
p109
aa(lp110
VSome people believe that
p111
aVthere are a few people at the top of the fashion food chain
p112
aVwho sort of dictate to us what we're all going to wear,
p113
aVbut if you talk to any designer at any level,
p114
aVincluding these high-end designers,
p115
aVthey always say
p116
aVtheir main inspiration comes from the street:
p117
aVwhere people like you and me remix and match
p118
aVour own fashion looks.
p119
aVAnd that's where they really get a lot of their
p120
aVcreative inspiration,
p121
aVso it's both a top-down and a bottom-up kind of industry.
p122
aa(lp123
VNow, the fast fashion giants have
p124
aVprobably benefited the most
p125
aVfrom the lack of copyright protection in the fashion industry.
p126
aVThey are notorious for knocking off high-end designs
p127
aVand selling them at very low prices.
p128
aVAnd they've been faced with a lot of lawsuits,
p129
aVbut those lawsuits are usually not won by fashion designers.
p130
aVThe courts have said over and over again, "You don't need
p131
aVany more intellectual property protection."
p132
aVWhen you look at copies like this,
p133
aVyou wonder: How do the luxury high-end brands
p134
aVremain in business?
p135
aVIf you can get it for 200 bucks, why pay a thousand?
p136
aVWell, that's one reason we had a conference here at USC a few years ago.
p137
aVWe invited Tom Ford to come \u2014
p138
aVthe conference was called, "Ready to Share:
p139
aVFashion and the Ownership of Creativity" \u2014
p140
aVand we asked him exactly this question.
p141
aVHere's what he had to say.
p142
aVHe had just come off a successful stint as the lead designer at Gucci,
p143
aVin case you didn't know.
p144
aa(lp145
VTom Ford: And we found after much research
p146
aVthat \u2014 actually not much research, quite simple research \u2014
p147
aVthat the counterfeit customer was not our customer.
p148
aa(lp149
VJohanna Blakley: Imagine that.
p150
aVThe people on Santee Alley
p151
aVare not the ones who shop at Gucci.
p152
aV(Laughter)
p153
aVThis is a very different demographic.
p154
aVAnd, you know, a knock-off is never the same
p155
aVas an original high-end design,
p156
aVat least in terms of the materials; they're always made of cheaper materials.
p157
aVBut even sometimes a cheaper version
p158
aVcan actually have some charming aspects,
p159
aVcan breathe a little extra life into a dying trend.
p160
aVThere's lots of virtues of copying.
p161
aVOne that a lot of cultural critics have pointed to
p162
aVis that we now have
p163
aVa much broader palette
p164
aVof design choices to choose from than we ever have before,
p165
aVand this is mainly because of the fast fashion industry, actually.
p166
aVAnd this is a good thing. We need lots of options.
p167
aa(lp168
VFashion, whether you like it or not,
p169
aVhelps you project who you are to the world.
p170
aVBecause of fast fashion,
p171
aVglobal trends actually get established much more quickly than they used to.
p172
aVAnd this, actually, is good news to trendsetters;
p173
aVthey want trends to be set
p174
aVso that they can move product.
p175
aVFor fashionistas,
p176
aVthey want to stay ahead of the curve.
p177
aVThey don't want to be wearing what everybody else is wearing.
p178
aVAnd so, they want to move on to the next trend
p179
aVas soon as possible.
p180
aa(lp181
VI tell you, there is no rest for the fashionable.
p182
aVEvery season, these designers have to struggle
p183
aVto come up with the new fabulous idea that everybody's going to love.
p184
aVAnd this, let me tell you,
p185
aVis very good for the bottom line.
p186
aVNow of course, there's a bunch of effects
p187
aVthat this culture of copying has
p188
aVon the creative process.
p189
aVAnd Stuart Weitzman is a very successful shoe designer.
p190
aVHe has complained a lot about people copying him,
p191
aVbut in one interview I read,
p192
aVhe said it has really forced him to up his game.
p193
aVHe had to come up with new ideas,
p194
aVnew things that would be hard to copy.
p195
aVHe came up with this Bowden-wedge heel
p196
aVthat has to be made out of steel or titanium;
p197
aVif you make it from some sort of cheaper material,
p198
aVit'll actually crack in two.
p199
aVIt forced him to be a little more innovative. (Music)
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd that actually reminded me
p202
aVof jazz great, Charlie Parker.
p203
aVI don't know if you've heard this anecdote, but I have.
p204
aVHe said that one of the reasons he invented bebop
p205
aVwas that he was pretty sure
p206
aVthat white musicians wouldn't be able to replicate the sound. (Laughter)
p207
aVHe wanted to make it too difficult to copy,
p208
aVand that's what fashion designers are doing all the time.
p209
aVThey're trying to put together
p210
aVa signature look, an aesthetic
p211
aVthat reflects who they are.
p212
aVWhen people knock it off, everybody knows
p213
aVbecause they've put that look out on the runway,
p214
aVand it's a coherent aesthetic.
p215
aa(lp216
VI love these Gallianos.
p217
aVOkay, we'll move on. (Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VThis is not unlike the world of comedy.
p220
aVI don't know if you know that jokes
p221
aValso can't be copyright protected.
p222
aVSo when one-liners were really popular,
p223
aVeverybody stole them from one another.
p224
aVBut now, we have a different kind of comic.
p225
aVThey develop a persona,
p226
aVa signature style, much like fashion designers.
p227
aVAnd their jokes,
p228
aVmuch like the fashion designs by a fashion designer,
p229
aVreally only work within that aesthetic.
p230
aVIf somebody steals a joke
p231
aVfrom Larry David, for instance,
p232
aVit's not as funny.
p233
aa(lp234
VNow, the other thing that fashion designers have done
p235
aVto survive in this culture of copying
p236
aVis they've learned how to copy themselves.
p237
aVThey knock themselves off.
p238
aVThey make deals with the fast fashion giants
p239
aVand they come up with a way to sell their product
p240
aVto a whole new demographic:
p241
aVthe Santee Alley demographic.
p242
aa(lp243
VNow, some fashion designers will say,
p244
aV"It's only in the United States that we don't have any respect.
p245
aVIn other countries there is protection
p246
aVfor our artful designs."
p247
aVBut if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world,
p248
aVit turns out that the protection that's offered
p249
aVis really ineffectual.
p250
aVIn Japan, for instance, which I think is the third largest market,
p251
aVthey have a design law; it protects apparel,
p252
aVbut the novelty standard is so high,
p253
aVyou have to prove that your garment has never existed before,
p254
aVit's totally unique.
p255
aVAnd that's sort of like
p256
aVthe novelty standard for a U.S. patent,
p257
aVwhich fashion designers never get \u2014
p258
aVrarely get here in the states.
p259
aa(lp260
VIn the European Union, they went in the other direction.
p261
aVVery low novelty standard,
p262
aVanybody can register anything.
p263
aVBut even though it's the home of the fast fashion industry
p264
aVand you have a lot of luxury designers there,
p265
aVthey don't register their garments, generally,
p266
aVand there's not a lot of litigation.
p267
aVIt turns out it's because the novelty standard is too low.
p268
aVA person can come in and take somebody else's gown,
p269
aVcut off three inches from the bottom,
p270
aVgo to the E.U. and register it as a new, original design.
p271
aVSo, that does not stop the knock-off artists.
p272
aVIf you look at the registry, actually,
p273
aVa lot of the registered things in the E.U.
p274
aVare Nike T-shirts
p275
aVthat are almost identical to one another.
p276
aa(lp277
VBut this has not stopped Diane von Furstenberg.
p278
aVShe is the head of
p279
aVthe Council of Fashion Designers of America,
p280
aVand she has told her constituency that
p281
aVshe is going to get copyright protection
p282
aVfor fashion designs.
p283
aVThe retailers have kind of quashed this notion though.
p284
aVI don't think the legislation is going anywhere,
p285
aVbecause they realized it is so hard
p286
aVto tell the difference between a pirated design
p287
aVand something that's just part of a global trend.
p288
aVWho owns a look?
p289
aVThat is a very difficult question to answer.
p290
aVIt takes lots of lawyers and lots of court time,
p291
aVand the retailers decided that would be way too expensive.
p292
aa(lp293
VYou know, it's not just the fashion industry
p294
aVthat doesn't have copyright protection.
p295
aVThere's a bunch of other industries that don't have copyright protection,
p296
aVincluding the food industry.
p297
aVYou cannot copyright a recipe
p298
aVbecause it's a set of instructions, it's fact,
p299
aVand you cannot copyright the look and feel
p300
aVof even the most unique dish.
p301
aVSame with automobiles.
p302
aVIt doesn't matter how wacky they look or how cool they look,
p303
aVyou cannot copyright the sculptural design.
p304
aVIt's a utilitarian article, that's why.
p305
aVSame with furniture,
p306
aVit's too utilitarian.
p307
aVMagic tricks, I think they're instructions, sort of like recipes:
p308
aVno copyright protection.
p309
aVHairdos, no copyright protection.
p310
aVOpen source software, these guys decided
p311
aVthey didn't want copyright protection.
p312
aVThey thought it'd be more innovative without it.
p313
aVIt's really hard to get copyright for databases.
p314
aVTattoo artists, they don't want it; it's not cool.
p315
aVThey share their designs.
p316
aVJokes, no copyright protection.
p317
aVFireworks displays,
p318
aVthe rules of games,
p319
aVthe smell of perfume: no.
p320
aVAnd some of these industries may seem
p321
aVsort of marginal to you,
p322
aVbut these are the gross sales
p323
aVfor low I.P. industries,
p324
aVindustries with very little copyright protection,
p325
aVand there's the gross sales of
p326
aVfilms and books.
p327
aV(Applause)
p328
aVIt ain't pretty.
p329
aa(lp330
V(Applause)
p331
aa(lp332
VSo you talk to people in the fashion industry
p333
aVand they're like, "Shhh!
p334
aVDon't tell anybody
p335
aVwe can actually steal from each other's designs.
p336
aVIt's embarrassing."
p337
aVBut you know what? It's revolutionary,
p338
aVand it's a model that a lot of other industries \u2014
p339
aVlike the ones we just saw with the really small bars \u2014
p340
aVthey might have to think about this.
p341
aVBecause right now, those industries with a lot of copyright protection
p342
aVare operating in an atmosphere
p343
aVwhere it's as if they don't have any protection,
p344
aVand they don't know what to do.
p345
aa(lp346
VWhen I found out that there are a whole bunch of industries
p347
aVthat didn't have copyright protection,
p348
aVI thought, "What exactly is the underlying logic?
p349
aVI want a picture." And the lawyers do not provide a picture,
p350
aVso I made one.
p351
aVThese are the two main
p352
aVsort of binary oppositions within the logic of copyright law.
p353
aVIt is more complex than this, but this will do.
p354
aVFirst: Is something an artistic object?
p355
aVThen it deserves protection.
p356
aVIs it a utilitarian object?
p357
aVThen no, it does not deserve protection.
p358
aVThis is a difficult, unstable binary.
p359
aa(lp360
VThe other one is: Is it an idea?
p361
aVIs it something that needs to
p362
aVfreely circulate in a free society?
p363
aVNo protection.
p364
aVOr is it a physically fixed
p365
aVexpression of an idea:
p366
aVsomething that somebody made
p367
aVand they deserve to own it for a while and make money from it?
p368
aVThe problem is that digital technology
p369
aVhas completely subverted the logic
p370
aVof this physically fixed, expression
p371
aVversus idea concept.
p372
aVNowadays,
p373
aVwe don't really recognize a book
p374
aVas something that sits on our shelf
p375
aVor music as something that is
p376
aVa physical object that we can hold.
p377
aVIt's a digital file.
p378
aVIt is barely tethered to any sort of
p379
aVphysical reality in our minds.
p380
aVAnd these things, because we can copy and transmit them so easily,
p381
aVactually circulate within our culture
p382
aVa lot more like ideas
p383
aVthan like physically instantiated objects.
p384
aa(lp385
VNow, the conceptual issues are truly profound
p386
aVwhen you talk about creativity
p387
aVand ownership
p388
aVand, let me tell you, we don't want to leave this just to lawyers to figure out.
p389
aVThey're smart.
p390
aVI'm with one. He's my boyfriend, he's okay.
p391
aVHe's smart, he's smart.
p392
aVBut you want an interdisciplinary team of people
p393
aVhashing this out,
p394
aVtrying to figure out: What is the kind of ownership model,
p395
aVin a digital world,
p396
aVthat's going to lead to the most innovation?
p397
aVAnd my suggestion is that
p398
aVfashion might be a really good place
p399
aVto start looking for a model
p400
aVfor creative industries in the future.

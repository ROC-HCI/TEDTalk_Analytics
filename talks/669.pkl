VI'm a writer and a journalist,
p5
aVand I'm also an insanely curious person,
p6
aVso in 22 years as a journalist,
p7
aVI've learned how to do a lot of new things.
p8
aVAnd three years ago, one of the things I learned how to do
p9
aVwas to become invisible.
p10
aVI became one of the working homeless.
p11
aVI quit my job as a newspaper editor
p12
aVafter my father died in February of that same year,
p13
aVand decided to travel.
p14
aVHis death hit me pretty hard.
p15
aVAnd there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that.
p16
aa(lp17
VI've camped my whole life. And I decided
p18
aVthat living in a van for a year to do this
p19
aVwould be like one long camping trip.
p20
aVSo I packed my cat, my Rottweiler
p21
aVand my camping gear into a 1975 Chevy van,
p22
aVand drove off into the sunset,
p23
aVhaving fully failed to realize three critical things.
p24
aVOne: that society equates
p25
aVliving in a permanent structure, even a shack,
p26
aVwith having value as a person.
p27
aVTwo: I failed to realize how quickly
p28
aVthe negative perceptions of other people
p29
aVcan impact our reality, if we let it.
p30
aVThree: I failed to realize
p31
aVthat homelessness is an attitude,
p32
aVnot a lifestyle.
p33
aa(lp34
VAt first, living in the van was great.
p35
aVI showered in campgrounds. I ate out regularly.
p36
aVAnd I had time to relax and to grieve.
p37
aVBut then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in.
p38
aVMy freelance job ended. And I had to get a full-time job
p39
aVto pay the bills.
p40
aVWhat had been a really mild spring
p41
aVturned into a miserably hot summer.
p42
aVAnd it became impossible to park anywhere \u2014
p43
aV(Laughs)
p44
aV\u2014 without being very obvious
p45
aVthat I had a cat and a dog with me, and it was really hot.
p46
aVThe cat came and went through an open window in the van.
p47
aVThe doggy went into doggy day care.
p48
aVAnd I sweated.
p49
aVWhenever I could, I used
p50
aVemployee showers in office buildings and truck stops.
p51
aVOr I washed up in public rest rooms.
p52
aa(lp53
VNighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below 80 degrees Fahrenheit,
p54
aVmaking it difficult or impossible to sleep.
p55
aVFood rotted in the heat.
p56
aVIce in my ice chest melted within hours,
p57
aVand it was pretty miserable.
p58
aVI couldn't afford to find an apartment,
p59
aVor couldn't afford an apartment that would allow me
p60
aVto have the Rottweiler and the cat.
p61
aVAnd I refused to give them up,
p62
aVso I stayed in the van.
p63
aVAnd when the heat made me too sick
p64
aVto walk the 50 feet to the public restroom
p65
aVoutside my van at night,
p66
aVI used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet.
p67
aa(lp68
VWhen winter weather set in, the temperatures dropped
p69
aVbelow freezing. And they stayed there.
p70
aVAnd I faced a whole new set of challenges.
p71
aVI parked a different place every night
p72
aVso I would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police.
p73
aVI didn't always succeed.
p74
aa(lp75
VBut I felt out of control of my life.
p76
aVAnd I don't know when or how it happened,
p77
aVbut the speed at which I went
p78
aVfrom being a talented writer and journalist
p79
aVto being a homeless woman, living in a van,
p80
aVtook my breath away.
p81
aVI hadn't changed. My I.Q. hadn't dropped.
p82
aVMy talent, my integrity, my values,
p83
aVeverything about me remained the same.
p84
aVBut I had changed somehow.
p85
aVI spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic.
p88
aVAnd I went. I hadn't bathed in three days.
p89
aVI was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line.
p90
aVI just wasn't drunk or high.
p91
aVAnd when several of the homeless men realized that,
p92
aVincluding a former university professor,
p93
aVthey said, "You aren't homeless. Why are you really here?"
p94
aVOther homeless people didn't see me as homeless,
p95
aVbut I did.
p96
aVThen the professor listened to my story and he said,
p97
aV"You have a job. You have hope.
p98
aVThe real homeless don't have hope."
p99
aVA reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression
p100
aVleft me suicidal. And I remember thinking,
p101
aV"If I killed myself, no one would notice."
p102
aa(lp103
VA friend told me, shortly after that,
p104
aVthat she had heard that Tim Russert,
p105
aVa nationally renowned journalist,
p106
aVhad been talking about me on national T.V.
p107
aVAn essay I'd written about my father,
p108
aVthe year before he died, was in Tim's new book.
p109
aVAnd he was doing the talk show circuit. And he was talking about my writing.
p110
aVAnd when I realized that Tim Russert, former moderator of "Meet the Press,"
p111
aVwas talking about my writing,
p112
aVwhile I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot,
p113
aVI started laughing.
p114
aVYou should too.
p115
aV(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VI started laughing
p118
aVbecause it got to the point where,
p119
aVwas I a writer, or was I a homeless woman?
p120
aVSo I went in the bookstore. And I found Tim's book.
p121
aVAnd I stood there. And I reread my essay.
p122
aVAnd I cried.
p123
aVBecause I was a writer.
p124
aVI was a writer.
p125
aVShortly after that I moved back to Tennessee.
p126
aVI alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends.
p127
aVAnd I started writing again.
p128
aVBy the summer of the following year I was a working journalist.
p129
aVI was winning awards. I was living in my own apartment.
p130
aVI was no longer homeless.
p131
aVAnd I was no longer invisible.
p132
aa(lp133
VThousands of people work full and part-time jobs,
p134
aVand live in their cars.
p135
aVBut society continues to stigmatize and criminalize
p136
aVliving in your vehicle or on the streets.
p137
aVSo the homeless, the working homeless, primarily remain invisible.
p138
aVBut if you ever meet one,
p139
aVengage them, encourage them, and offer them hope.
p140
aVThe human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope.
p141
aVAnd I'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless.
p142
aVI'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet.
p143
aVBut I am here to tell you that, based on my experience,
p144
aVpeople are not where they live,
p145
aVwhere they sleep,
p146
aVor what their life situation is at any given time.
p147
aVThree years ago I was living in a van
p148
aVin a Wal-Mart parking lot,
p149
aVand today I'm speaking at TED.
p150
aVHope always, always finds a way. Thank you.
p151

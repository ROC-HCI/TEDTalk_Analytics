VHi. I am an architect.
p5
aVI am the only architect in the world
p6
aVmaking buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube,
p7
aVand this exhibition is the first one I did
p8
aVusing paper tubes.
p9
aV1986, much, much longer before people started talking
p10
aVabout ecological issues and environmental issues,
p11
aVI just started testing the paper tube
p12
aVin order to use this as a building structure.
p13
aVIt's very complicated to test the new material for the building,
p14
aVbut this is much stronger than I expected,
p15
aVand also it's very easy to waterproof,
p16
aVand also, because it's industrial material,
p17
aVit's also possible to fireproof.
p18
aa(lp19
VThen I built the temporary structure, 1990.
p20
aVThis is the first temporary building made out of paper.
p21
aVThere are 330 tubes, diameter 55 [centimeters],
p22
aVthere are only 12 tubes with a diameter
p23
aVof 120 centimeters, or four feet, wide.
p24
aVAs you see it in the photo, inside is the toilet.
p25
aVIn case you're finished with toilet paper,
p26
aVyou can tear off the inside of the wall. (Laughter)
p27
aVSo it's very useful.
p28
aa(lp29
VYear 2000, there was a big expo in Germany.
p30
aVI was asked to design the building,
p31
aVbecause the theme of the expo was environmental issues.
p32
aVSo I was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes,
p33
aVrecyclable paper.
p34
aVMy goal of the design is not when it's completed.
p35
aVMy goal was when the building was demolished,
p36
aVbecause each country makes a lot of pavilions
p37
aVbut after half a year, we create a lot of industrial waste,
p38
aVso my building has to be reused or recycled.
p39
aVAfter, the building was recycled.
p40
aVSo that was the goal of my design.
p41
aa(lp42
VThen I was very lucky to win the competition
p43
aVto build the second Pompidou Center in France
p44
aVin the city of Metz.
p45
aVBecause I was so poor,
p46
aVI wanted to rent an office in Paris,
p47
aVbut I couldn't afford it,
p48
aVso I decided to bring my students to Paris
p49
aVto build our office on top of the Pompidou Center in Paris
p50
aVby ourselves.
p51
aVSo we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints
p52
aVto complete the 35-meter-long office.
p53
aVWe stayed there for six years without paying any rent.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p56
aa(lp57
VThank you. I had one big problem.
p58
aVBecause we were part of the exhibition,
p59
aVeven if my friend wanted to see me, they had to buy a ticket to see me.
p60
aVThat was the problem.
p61
aa(lp62
VThen I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz.
p63
aVIt's a very popular museum now,
p64
aVand I created a big monument for the government.
p65
aa(lp66
VBut then I was very disappointed
p67
aVat my profession as an architect,
p68
aVbecause we are not helping, we are not working for society,
p69
aVbut we are working for privileged people,
p70
aVrich people, government, developers.
p71
aVThey have money and power.
p72
aVThose are invisible.
p73
aVSo they hire us to visualize their power and money
p74
aVby making monumental architecture.
p75
aVThat is our profession, even historically it's the same,
p76
aVeven now we are doing the same.
p77
aVSo I was very disappointed that we are not working for society,
p78
aVeven though there are so many people
p79
aVwho lost their houses by natural disasters.
p80
aVBut I must say they are no longer natural disasters.
p81
aVFor example, earthquakes never kill people,
p82
aVbut collapse of the buildings kill people.
p83
aVThat's the responsibility of architects.
p84
aVThen people need some temporary housing,
p85
aVbut there are no architects working there
p86
aVbecause we are too busy working for privileged people.
p87
aVSo I thought, even as architects,
p88
aVwe can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing.
p89
aVWe can make it better.
p90
aVSo that is why I started working in disaster areas.
p91
aa(lp92
V1994, there was a big disaster in Rwanda, Africa.
p93
aVTwo tribes, Hutu and Tutsi, fought each other.
p94
aVOver two million people became refugees.
p95
aVBut I was so surprised to see the shelter, refugee camp
p96
aVorganized by the U.N.
p97
aVThey're so poor, and they are freezing
p98
aVwith blankets during the rainy season,
p99
aVIn the shelters built by the U.N.,
p100
aVthey were just providing a plastic sheet,
p101
aVand the refugees had to cut the trees, and just like this.
p102
aVBut over two million people cut trees.
p103
aVIt just became big, heavy deforestation
p104
aVand an environmental problem.
p105
aVThat is why they started providing aluminum pipes, aluminum barracks.
p106
aVVery expensive, they throw them out for money,
p107
aVthen cutting trees again.
p108
aVSo I proposed my idea to improve the situation
p109
aVusing these recycled paper tubes
p110
aVbecause this is so cheap and also so strong,
p111
aVbut my budget is only 50 U.S. dollars per unit.
p112
aVWe built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test
p113
aVfor the durability and moisture and termites, so on.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd then, year afterward, 1995, in Kobe, Japan,
p116
aVwe had a big earthquake.
p117
aVNearly 7,000 people were killed,
p118
aVand the city like this Nagata district,
p119
aVall the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake.
p120
aVAnd also I found out there's many Vietnamese refugees
p121
aVsuffering and gathering at a Catholic church \u2014
p122
aVall the building was totally destroyed.
p123
aa(lp124
VSo I went there and also I proposed to the priests,
p125
aV"Why don't we rebuild the church out of paper tubes?"
p126
aa(lp127
VAnd he said, "Oh God, are you crazy?
p128
aVAfter a fire, what are you proposing?"
p129
aa(lp130
VSo he never trusted me, but I didn't give up.
p131
aVI started commuting to Kobe,
p132
aVand I met the society of Vietnamese people.
p133
aVThey were living like this with very poor plastic sheets
p134
aVin the park.
p135
aVSo I proposed to rebuild. I raised \u2014 did fundraising.
p136
aVI made a paper tube shelter for them,
p137
aVand in order to make it easy to be built by students
p138
aVand also easy to demolish,
p139
aVI used beer crates as a foundation.
p140
aVI asked the Kirin beer company to propose,
p141
aVbecause at that time, the Asahi beer company
p142
aVmade their plastic beer crates red,
p143
aVwhich doesn't go with the color of the paper tubes.
p144
aVThe color coordination is very important.
p145
aVAnd also I still remember, we were expecting
p146
aVto have a beer inside the plastic beer crate,
p147
aVbut it came empty. (Laughter)
p148
aVSo I remember it was so disappointing.
p149
aVSo during the summer with my students,
p150
aVwe built over 50 units of the shelters.
p151
aa(lp152
VFinally the priest, finally he trusted me to rebuild.
p153
aVHe said, "As long as you collect money by yourself,
p154
aVbring your students to build, you can do it."
p155
aa(lp156
VSo we spent five weeks rebuilding the church.
p157
aVIt was meant to stay there for three years,
p158
aVbut actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it.
p159
aVThen, in Taiwan, they had a big earthquake,
p160
aVand we proposed to donate this church,
p161
aVso we dismantled them,
p162
aVwe sent them over to be built by volunteer people.
p163
aVIt stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now.
p164
aVSo this building became a permanent building.
p165
aa(lp166
VThen I wonder, what is a permanent and what is a temporary building?
p167
aVEven a building made in paper
p168
aVcan be permanent as long as people love it.
p169
aVEven a concrete building can be very temporary
p170
aVif that is made to make money.
p171
aa(lp172
VIn 1999, in Turkey, the big earthquake,
p173
aVI went there to use the local material to build a shelter.
p174
aV2001, in West India, I built also a shelter.
p175
aVIn 2004, in Sri Lanka, after the Sumatra earthquake
p176
aVand tsunami, I rebuilt Islamic fishermen's villages.
p177
aa(lp178
VAnd in 2008, in Chengdu, Sichuan area in China,
p179
aVnearly 70,000 people were killed,
p180
aVand also especially many of the schools were destroyed
p181
aVbecause of the corruption between the authority and the contractor.
p182
aVI was asked to rebuild the temporary church.
p183
aVI brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students.
p184
aVIn one month, we completed nine classrooms,
p185
aVover 500 square meters.
p186
aVIt's still used, even after the current earthquake in China.
p187
aa(lp188
VIn 2009, in Italy, L'Aquila, also they had a big earthquake.
p189
aVAnd this is a very interesting photo:
p190
aVformer Prime Minister Berlusconi
p191
aVand Japanese former former former former Prime Minister Mr. Aso \u2014
p192
aVyou know, because we have to change the prime minister ever year.
p193
aVAnd they are very kind, affording my model.
p194
aVI proposed a big rebuilding, a temporary music hall,
p195
aVbecause L'Aquila is very famous for music
p196
aVand all the concert halls were destroyed,
p197
aVso musicians were moving out.
p198
aa(lp199
VSo I proposed to the mayor,
p200
aVI'd like to rebuild the temporary auditorium.
p201
aVHe said, "As long as you bring your money, you can do it."
p202
aVAnd I was very lucky.
p203
aVMr. Berlusconi brought G8 summit,
p204
aVand our former prime minister came,
p205
aVso they helped us to collect money,
p206
aVand I got half a million euros from the Japanese government
p207
aVto rebuild this temporary auditorium.
p208
aa(lp209
VYear 2010 in Haiti, there was a big earthquake,
p210
aVbut it's impossible to fly over,
p211
aVso I went to Santo Domingo, next-door country,
p212
aVto drive six hours to get to Haiti
p213
aVwith the local students in Santo Domingo
p214
aVto build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes.
p215
aa(lp216
VThis is what happened in Japan two years ago, in northern Japan.
p217
aVAfter the earthquake and tsunami,
p218
aVpeople had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium.
p219
aVBut look at this. There's no privacy.
p220
aVPeople suffer mentally and physically.
p221
aVSo we went there to build partitions
p222
aVwith all the student volunteers with paper tubes,
p223
aVjust a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain.
p224
aVHowever, some of the facility authority
p225
aVdoesn't want us to do it, because, they said,
p226
aVsimply, it's become more difficult to control them.
p227
aVBut it's really necessary to do it.
p228
aa(lp229
VThey don't have enough flat area to build
p230
aVstandard government single-story housing like this one.
p231
aVLook at this. Even civil government is doing
p232
aVsuch poor construction of the temporary housing,
p233
aVso dense and so messy because there is no storage, nothing, water is leaking,
p234
aVso I thought, we have to make multi-story building
p235
aVbecause there's no land and also it's not very comfortable.
p236
aa(lp237
VSo I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions.
p238
aVFinally I met a very nice mayor in Onagawa village
p239
aVin Miyagi.
p240
aVHe asked me to build three-story housing on baseball [fields].
p241
aVI used the shipping container
p242
aVand also the students helped us to make
p243
aVall the building furniture
p244
aVto make them comfortable,
p245
aVwithin the budget of the government
p246
aVbut also the area of the house is exactly the same,
p247
aVbut much more comfortable.
p248
aVMany of the people want to stay here forever.
p249
aVI was very happy to hear that.
p250
aa(lp251
VNow I am working in New Zealand, Christchurch.
p252
aVAbout 20 days before the Japanese earthquake happened,
p253
aValso they had a big earthquake,
p254
aVand many Japanese students were also killed,
p255
aVand the most important cathedral of the city,
p256
aVthe symbol of Christchurch, was totally destroyed.
p257
aVAnd I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral.
p258
aa(lp259
VSo this is under construction.
p260
aVAnd I'd like to keep building monuments
p261
aVthat are beloved by people.
p262
aa(lp263
VThank you very much.
p264
aa(lp265
V(Applause)
p266
aa(lp267
VThank you. (Applause)
p268
aa(lp269
VThank you very much. (Applause)

In 1986, for the Alvar Aalto Exhibition near Tokyo, Ban experimented with constructing a building from long paper tubes, the kind found at textile factories. The tubes ended up being much stronger than he had imagined, and were easier to waterproof and fireproof than he had guessed.

In 1994, Ban created shelters for refugees in Rwanda. The next year, after an earthquake in Japan, he rebuilt a local church out of paper tubes that became a local fixture for 10 years. His designs -- both low-cost, and dignity-building -- have housed people affected by disasters in Taiwan, China, Haiti, Turkey and Sri Lanka.

architecture redefines aesthetics, space, structure and even the idea of permanence. In 1986, for the Alvar Aalto Exhibition near Tokyo, Ban experimented with constructing a building from long paper tubes, the kind found at textile factories. The tubes ended up being much stronger than he had imagined, and were easier to waterproof and fireproof than he had guessed. Ban created many experimental buildings in this vein -- from the Japanese Pavilion at Expo 2000 in Germany, which was meant to be recycled upon demolition, to an office for himself and his students set atop the Pompidou Centre in Paris, where they worked for six years.</p> <p>But Ban&#39;s paper-tube designs have found another use -- as emergency shelters for those who have lost their homes in disasters and wars. In 1994, Ban created shelters for refugees in Rwanda. The next year, after an earthquake in Japan, he rebuilt a local church out of paper tubes that became a local fixture for 10 years. His designs -- both low-cost, and dignity-building -- have housed people affected by disasters in Taiwan, China, Haiti, Turkey and Sri Lanka. He helped develop a shelter system after the Japanese earthquake and tsunami of 2011.</p> <p>The founder of <a href=\\"http://www.shigerubanarchitects.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Shigeru Ban Architects</a>, Ban is the 2014 Pritzker Prize winner.

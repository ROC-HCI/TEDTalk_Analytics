V"My Air Jordans cost a hundred with tax.
p5
aVMy suede Starters jacket says Raiders on the back.
p6
aVI'm stylin', smilin', lookin' real mean,
p7
aVbecause it ain't about being heard, just being seen.
p8
aVMy leather Adidas baseball cap matches
p9
aVmy fake Gucci backpack. (Laughter)
p10
aVAin't nobody who looks as good as me,
p11
aVbut this costs money, it sure ain't free,
p12
aVand I gots no job, no money at all,
p13
aVbut it's easy to steal all this from the mall.
p14
aVParents say I shouldn't, but I knows I should.
p15
aVGot to do what I can to make sure I look good,
p16
aVand the reason I have to look real good, well, to tell you the truth, man,
p17
aVI don't know why. Guess it makes me feel special inside.
p18
aVWhen I'm wearing fresh gear I don't have to hide,
p19
aVand I really must get some new gear soon
p20
aVor my ego will pop like a 10-cent balloon.
p21
aVBut security is tight at all the shops. Every day there are more and more cops.
p22
aVMy crew is laughing at me because I'm wearing old gear.
p23
aVSchool's almost over. Summer is near.
p24
aVAnd I'm sportin' torn Jordans.
p25
aVI need something new. Only one thing left to do.
p26
aVCut school Friday, catch the subway downtown,
p27
aVcheck out my victims hangin' around.
p28
aVMaybe I'll get lucky and find easy prey.
p29
aVGot to get some new gear. There's no other way.
p30
aVI'm ready and willing. I'm packing my gun.
p31
aVThis is serious business. This ain't no fun.
p32
aVAnd I can't have my posse laughin' at me.
p33
aVI'mma cop something dope, just wait, you'll see.
p34
aVCome out of the station, West 4th near the park,
p35
aVbrothers shooting hoops and someone remarks,
p36
aV'Hey homes, where you get them Nik's?'
p37
aVI says to myself, 'Yeah. I likes 'em, I likes.'
p38
aVThey were Q-tip white, bright and blinding my eyes.
p39
aVThe red emblem of Michael looked as if it could fly.
p40
aVNot one spot of dirt. The Airs were brand new.
p41
aVHad my pistol and knew just what to do.
p42
aVWaited until it was just the right time, followed him very closely behind.
p43
aVHe made a left turn on Houston, I pulled out my gun,
p44
aVand I said, 'Gimme them Jordans!'
p45
aVAnd the punk tried to run.
p46
aVTook off fast, didn't get far. I fired,'Pow!'
p47
aVFool fell between two parked cars.
p48
aVHe was coughing, crying, blood spilled on the street.
p49
aVAnd I snatched them Air Jordans off of his feet.
p50
aVWhile laying there dying, all he could say
p51
aVwas, "Please man, don't take my Air Jordans away."
p52
aVYou'd think he'd be worried about staying alive.
p53
aVAs I took off with his sneakers, there was tears in his eyes.
p54
aVVery next day, I bopped into school
p55
aVwith my brand new Air Jordans, man, I was cool.
p56
aVI killed to get 'em, but hey, I don't care,
p57
aVbecause now I needs a new jacket to wear."
p58
aa(lp59
VThank you. (Applause)
p60
aa(lp61
VFor the last 15 years that I have been performing,
p62
aVall I ever wanted to do was transcend poetry to the world.
p63
aVSee, it wasn't enough for me to write a book.
p64
aVIt wasn't enough for me to join a slam competition,
p65
aVand while those things hold weight,
p66
aVit wasn't the driving force that pushes the pen to the pad.
p67
aVThe hunger and thirst was, and still remains:
p68
aVHow do I get people who hate poetry
p69
aVto love me?
p70
aVBecause I'm an extension of my work,
p71
aVand if they love me, then they will love my work,
p72
aVand if they love my work, then they will love poetry,
p73
aVand if they love poetry, then I will have done my job,
p74
aVwhich is to transcend it to the world.
p75
aa(lp76
VAnd in 1996, I found the answer in principles
p77
aVin a master spoken-word artist named Reg E. Gaines,
p78
aVwho wrote the famous poem, "Please Don't Take My Air Jordans."
p79
aVAnd I followed this guy everywhere until I had him in the room,
p80
aVand I read him one of my pieces,
p81
aVand you know what he told me?
p82
aV"Yo' wack.
p83
aVYou know what the problem is with you, homie?
p84
aVYou don't read other people's poetry,
p85
aVand you don't got any subordination for verbal measures
p86
aVto tonal consideration." (Laughter)
p87
aVNow he kept on rambling
p88
aVabout poetry and styles and Nuyorican Friday nights.
p89
aa(lp90
VNow I could have quit. I should have quit.
p91
aVI mean, I thought poetry was just self-expression.
p92
aVI didn't know you actually have to have creative control.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo instead of quitting, I followed him everywhere.
p95
aVWhen he was writing a Broadway show, I would be outside of the door.
p96
aVI would wake him up at, like, 6:30 in the morning
p97
aVto ask him who's the best poet.
p98
aVI remember eating the eyes of a fish right out of the sea
p99
aVbecause he told me it was brain food.
p100
aa(lp101
VThen one day I told him,
p102
aV"Reg E., what is subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration?" (Laughter)
p103
aVAnd he handed me a black-and-white printed out thesis
p104
aVon a poet named Etheridge Knight
p105
aVand the oral nature of poetry,
p106
aVand from that point,
p107
aVReggie stopped becoming the best to me,
p108
aVbecause what Etheridge Knight taught me
p109
aVwas that I could make my words sound like music,
p110
aVeven my small ones, the monosyllables,
p111
aVthe ifs, ands, buts, whats,
p112
aVthe gangsta in my slang could fall right on the ear,
p113
aVand from then on, I started chasing Etheridge Knight.
p114
aVI wanted to know which poet he read,
p115
aVand I landed on a poem called ["Dark Prophecy: Sing of Shine"],
p116
aVa toast signifying that got me on the biggest stage
p117
aVa poet could ever be:
p118
aVBroadway, baby.
p119
aVAnd from that point, I learned how to pull the mic away
p120
aVand attack the poetry with my body.
p121
aa(lp122
VBut that wasn't the biggest lesson I ever learned.
p123
aVThe biggest lesson I learned was many years later
p124
aVwhen I went to Beverly Hills and I ran into a talent agent
p125
aVwho looked at me up and down
p126
aVand said I don't look like I have any experience
p127
aVto be working in this business.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd I said to him, "Listen, punk fool,
p130
aVyou're a failed actor who became an agent,
p131
aVand you know why you failed as an actor?
p132
aVBecause people like me took your job.
p133
aVI've traveled all the way from Cleveland and Essex
p134
aVin East New York, took the local 6 line up to the hookers of Hunt's Point
p135
aVwho were in my way on my way to master the art of space,
p136
aVand the one-to-infinite amount of man, woman and child
p137
aVyou can fit in there only so I can push them
p138
aVto the back of the wall with my experience.
p139
aVPeople have bought tickets to my experience
p140
aVand used them as refrigerator magnets to let them know
p141
aVthat the revolution is near, so stock up.
p142
aVI'm so experienced that when you went
p143
aVto a privileged school to learn a Shakespearean sonnet,
p144
aVI was getting those beats kicked and shoved into me.
p145
aVI can master shock of "The Crying Game" with the awe
p146
aVof a child being called an AIDS victim by a bully who didn't know
p147
aVthat it was his father who gave it to my mother,
p148
aVand that's a double entendre.
p149
aVI'm so experienced that when you went to the Fell School
p150
aVand all the rich little fairy boys decided to sponsor a child
p151
aVin it, that was me, but kicked me out when I was caught
p152
aVteaching the fairy boys how to rob the PATS off a pair of Lee Jeans
p153
aVand bring them to VIM. Let me see Chekhov pull that off.
p154
aVSanford Meisner was my Uncle Artie yelling silently to himself,
p155
aV"Something's always wrong when nothing's always right."
p156
aVMethod acting is nothing but a mixture
p157
aVof multiple personalities, believing your own lies are reality,
p158
aVlike in high school cool Kenny telling me he wanted to be a cop.
p159
aVDude, you go to Riker's Island Academy.
p160
aVI could make David Mamet
p161
aVpsychoanalyze my attack on dialogue,
p162
aVStanislavski be as if he were Bruce Lee
p163
aVkicking your roster of talentless students up and down Crenshaw.
p164
aVSo what, your actors studied guerrilla theater at the London Rep?
p165
aVLet me tell you an ancient Chinese Saturday afternoon
p166
aVkung fu secret.
p167
aVBoards don't hit back.
p168
aVYou think black entertainers have it hard finding work
p169
aVin this business? I'm a suspicious mulatto,
p170
aVwhich means I'm too black to be white and too white to be doing it right.
p171
aVForget the American ghetto. I've cracked stages in Soweto,
p172
aVburied abortion babies in potter's field and still managed to keep a smile on my face,
p173
aVso whatever you curse at me to your caddyshack
p174
aVgo-for-this, go-for-that assistant when I walk out that door,
p175
aVwhatever slander you send my way,
p176
aVyour mother.
p177
aVThank you. (Applause)

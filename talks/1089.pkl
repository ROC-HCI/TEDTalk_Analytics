VSo I was born
p5
aVon the last day
p6
aVof the last year of the '70s.
p7
aVI was raised on "Free to be you and me" \u2014
p8
aV(cheering)
p9
aVhip-hop \u2014
p10
aVnot as many woohoos for hip-hop in the house.
p11
aVThank you. Thank you for hip-hop \u2014
p12
aVand Anita Hill.
p13
aV(Cheering)
p14
aVMy parents were radicals \u2014
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aVwho became,
p17
aVwell, grown-ups.
p18
aVMy dad facetiously says,
p19
aV"We wanted to save the world,
p20
aVand instead we just got rich."
p21
aVWe actually just got "middle class"
p22
aVin Colorado Springs, Colorado,
p23
aVbut you get the picture.
p24
aVI was raised with a very heavy sense
p25
aVof unfinished legacy.
p26
aa(lp27
VAt this ripe old age of 30,
p28
aVI've been thinking a lot about what it means to grow up
p29
aVin this horrible, beautiful time,
p30
aVand I've decided, for me,
p31
aVit's been a real journey and paradox.
p32
aVThe first paradox
p33
aVis that growing up is about rejecting the past
p34
aVand then promptly reclaiming it.
p35
aVFeminism was the water I grew up in.
p36
aVWhen I was just a little girl,
p37
aVmy mom started what is now
p38
aVthe longest-running women's film festival in the world.
p39
aVSo while other kids were watching sitcoms and cartoons,
p40
aVI was watching very esoteric documentaries
p41
aVmade by and about women.
p42
aVYou can see how this had an influence.
p43
aVBut she was not the only feminist in the house.
p44
aa(lp45
VMy dad actually resigned
p46
aVfrom the male-only business club in my hometown
p47
aVbecause he said he would never be part of an organization
p48
aVthat would one day welcome his son, but not his daughter.
p49
aV(Applause)
p50
aVHe's actually here today.
p51
aV(Applause)
p52
aVThe trick here
p53
aVis my brother would become an experimental poet,
p54
aVnot a businessman,
p55
aVbut the intention was really good.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VIn any case, I didn't readily claim the feminist label,
p60
aVeven though it was all around me,
p61
aVbecause I associated it with my mom's women's groups,
p62
aVher swishy skirts and her shoulder pads \u2014
p63
aVnone of which had much cachet
p64
aVin the hallways of Palmer High School
p65
aVwhere I was trying to be cool at the time.
p66
aVBut I suspected there was something really important
p67
aVabout this whole feminism thing,
p68
aVso I started covertly tiptoeing into my mom's bookshelves
p69
aVand picking books off and reading them \u2014
p70
aVnever, of course, admitting that I was doing so.
p71
aVI didn't actually claim the feminist label
p72
aVuntil I went to Barnard College
p73
aVand I heard Amy Richards and Jennifer Baumgardner speak for the first time.
p74
aVThey were the co-authors of a book called "Manifesta."
p75
aVSo what very profound epiphany, you might ask,
p76
aVwas responsible for my feminist click moment?
p77
aVFishnet stockings.
p78
aVJennifer Baumgardner was wearing them.
p79
aVI thought they were really hot.
p80
aVI decided, okay, I can claim the feminist label.
p81
aVNow I tell you this \u2014
p82
aVI tell you this at the risk of embarrassing myself,
p83
aVbecause I think part of the work of feminism
p84
aVis to admit that aesthetics, that beauty,
p85
aVthat fun do matter.
p86
aVThere are lots of very modern political movements
p87
aVthat have caught fire in no small part
p88
aVbecause of cultural hipness.
p89
aVAnyone heard of these two guys as an example?
p90
aa(lp91
VSo my feminism is very indebted to my mom's,
p92
aVbut it looks very different.
p93
aVMy mom says, "patriarchy."
p94
aVI say, "intersectionality."
p95
aVSo race, class, gender, ability,
p96
aVall of these things go into our experiences
p97
aVof what it means to be a woman.
p98
aVPay equity? Yes. Absolutely a feminist issue.
p99
aVBut for me, so is immigration. (Applause)
p100
aVThank you.
p101
aVMy mom says, "Protest march."
p102
aVI say, "Online organizing."
p103
aVI co-edit, along with a collective
p104
aVof other super-smart, amazing women,
p105
aVa site called Feministing.com.
p106
aVWe are the most widely read feminist publication ever,
p107
aVand I tell you this
p108
aVbecause I think it's really important to see
p109
aVthat there's a continuum.
p110
aa(lp111
VFeminist blogging is basically the 21st century version
p112
aVof consciousness raising.
p113
aVBut we also have a straightforward political impact.
p114
aVFeministing has been able
p115
aVto get merchandise pulled off the shelves of Walmart.
p116
aVWe got a misogynist administrator sending us hate-mail
p117
aVfired from a Big Ten school.
p118
aVAnd one of our biggest successes
p119
aVis we get mail from teenage girls in the middle of Iowa
p120
aVwho say, "I Googled Jessica Simpson and stumbled on your site.
p121
aVI realized feminism wasn't about man-hating and Birkenstocks."
p122
aVSo we're able to pull in the next generation
p123
aVin a totally new way.
p124
aa(lp125
VMy mom says, "Gloria Steinem."
p126
aVI say, "Samhita Mukhopadhyay,
p127
aVMiriam Perez, Ann Friedman,
p128
aVJessica Valenti, Vanessa Valenti,
p129
aVand on and on and on and on."
p130
aVWe don't want one hero.
p131
aVWe don't want one icon.
p132
aVWe don't want one face.
p133
aVWe are thousands of women and men across this country
p134
aVdoing online writing, community organizing,
p135
aVchanging institutions from the inside out \u2014
p136
aVall continuing the incredible work
p137
aVthat our mothers and grandmothers started.
p138
aVThank you.
p139
aa(lp140
V(Applause)
p141
aa(lp142
VWhich brings me to the second paradox:
p143
aVsobering up about our smallness
p144
aVand maintaining faith in our greatness
p145
aVall at once.
p146
aVMany in my generation \u2014
p147
aVbecause of well-intentioned parenting and self-esteem education \u2014
p148
aVwere socialized to believe
p149
aVthat we were special little snowflakes \u2014
p150
aV(Laughter)
p151
aVwho were going to go out and save the world.
p152
aVThese are three words many of us were raised with.
p153
aVWe walk across graduation stages,
p154
aVhigh on our overblown expectations,
p155
aVand when we float back down to earth,
p156
aVwe realize we don't know what the heck it means
p157
aVto actually save the world anyway.
p158
aVThe mainstream media often paints my generation
p159
aVas apathetic,
p160
aVand I think it's much more accurate
p161
aVto say we are deeply overwhelmed.
p162
aVAnd there's a lot to be overwhelmed about, to be fair \u2014
p163
aVan environmental crisis,
p164
aVwealth disparity in this country
p165
aVunlike we've seen since 1928,
p166
aVand globally,
p167
aVa totally immoral and ongoing wealth disparity.
p168
aVXenophobia's on the rise. The trafficking of women and girls.
p169
aVIt's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed.
p170
aa(lp171
VI experienced this firsthand myself
p172
aVwhen I graduated from Barnard College in 2002.
p173
aVI was fired up; I was ready to make a difference.
p174
aVI went out and I worked at a non-profit,
p175
aVI went to grad school, I phone-banked,
p176
aVI protested, I volunteered,
p177
aVand none of it seemed to matter.
p178
aVAnd on a particularly dark night
p179
aVof December of 2004,
p180
aVI sat down with my family,
p181
aVand I said that I had become very disillusioned.
p182
aVI admitted that I'd actually had a fantasy \u2014 kind of a dark fantasy \u2014
p183
aVof writing a letter
p184
aVabout everything that was wrong with the world
p185
aVand then lighting myself on fire
p186
aVon the White House steps.
p187
aVMy mom
p188
aVtook a drink of her signature Sea Breeze,
p189
aVher eyes really welled with tears,
p190
aVand she looked right at me and she said,
p191
aV"I will not stand
p192
aVfor your desperation."
p193
aVShe said, "You are smarter, more creative
p194
aVand more resilient than that."
p195
aa(lp196
VWhich brings me to my third paradox.
p197
aVGrowing up is about aiming to succeed wildly
p198
aVand being fulfilled by failing really well.
p199
aV(Laughter)
p200
aV(Applause)
p201
aVThere's a writer I've been deeply influenced by, Parker Palmer,
p202
aVand he writes that many of us are often whiplashed
p203
aV"between arrogant overestimation of ourselves
p204
aVand a servile underestimation of ourselves."
p205
aVYou may have guessed by now,
p206
aVI did not light myself on fire.
p207
aVI did what I know to do in desperation, which is write.
p208
aVI wrote the book I needed to read.
p209
aVI wrote a book about eight incredible people
p210
aVall over this country
p211
aVdoing social justice work.
p212
aVI wrote about Nia Martin-Robinson,
p213
aVthe daughter of Detroit and two civil rights activists,
p214
aVwho's dedicating her life
p215
aVto environmental justice.
p216
aVI wrote about Emily Apt
p217
aVwho initially became a caseworker in the welfare system
p218
aVbecause she decided that was the most noble thing she could do,
p219
aVbut quickly learned, not only did she not like it,
p220
aVbut she wasn't really good at it.
p221
aVInstead, what she really wanted to do was make films.
p222
aVSo she made a film about the welfare system
p223
aVand had a huge impact.
p224
aVI wrote about Maricela Guzman, the daughter of Mexican immigrants,
p225
aVwho joined the military so she could afford college.
p226
aVShe was actually sexually assaulted in boot camp
p227
aVand went on to co-organize a group
p228
aVcalled the Service Women's Action Network.
p229
aa(lp230
VWhat I learned from these people and others
p231
aVwas that I couldn't judge them
p232
aVbased on their failure to meet their very lofty goals.
p233
aVMany of them are working in deeply intractable systems \u2014
p234
aVthe military, congress,
p235
aVthe education system, etc.
p236
aVBut what they managed to do within those systems
p237
aVwas be a humanizing force.
p238
aVAnd at the end of the day,
p239
aVwhat could possibly be more important than that?
p240
aVCornel West says, "Of course it's a failure.
p241
aVBut how good a failure is it?"
p242
aVThis isn't to say we give up our wildest, biggest dreams.
p243
aVIt's to say we operate on two levels.
p244
aVOn one,
p245
aVwe really go after changing these broken systems
p246
aVof which we find ourselves a part.
p247
aVBut on the other, we root our self-esteem
p248
aVin the daily acts of trying to make one person's day
p249
aVmore kind, more just, etc.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo when I was a little girl,
p252
aVI had a couple of very strange habits.
p253
aVOne of them was
p254
aVI used to lie on the kitchen floor of my childhood home,
p255
aVand I would suck the thumb of my left hand
p256
aVand hold my mom's cold toes with my right hand.
p257
aV(Laughter)
p258
aVI was listening to her talk on the phone, which she did a lot.
p259
aVShe was talking about board meetings,
p260
aVshe was founding peace organizations,
p261
aVshe was coordinating carpools, she was consoling friends \u2014
p262
aVall these daily acts of care and creativity.
p263
aVAnd surely, at three and four years old,
p264
aVI was listening to the soothing sound of her voice,
p265
aVbut I think I was also getting my first lesson in activist work.
p266
aa(lp267
VThe activists I interviewed
p268
aVhad nothing in common, literally, except for one thing,
p269
aVwhich was that they all cited their mothers
p270
aVas their most looming and important
p271
aVactivist influences.
p272
aVSo often, particularly at a young age,
p273
aVwe look far afield
p274
aVfor our models of the meaningful life,
p275
aVand sometimes they're in our own kitchens,
p276
aVtalking on the phone, making us dinner,
p277
aVdoing all that keeps the world going around and around.
p278
aVMy mom and so many women like her
p279
aVhave taught me that life is not about glory,
p280
aVor certainty, or security even.
p281
aVIt's about embracing the paradox.
p282
aVIt's about acting in the face of overwhelm.
p283
aVAnd it's about loving people really well.
p284
aVAnd at the end of the day,
p285
aVthese things make for a lifetime
p286
aVof challenge and reward.
p287
aa(lp288
VThank you.
p289

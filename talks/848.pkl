VHow do you explain when things don't go as we assume?
p5
aVOr better, how do you explain
p6
aVwhen others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions?
p7
aVFor example:
p8
aVWhy is Apple so innovative?
p9
aVYear after year, after year,
p10
aVthey're more innovative than all their competition.
p11
aVAnd yet, they're just a computer company.
p12
aVThey're just like everyone else.
p13
aVThey have the same access to the same talent,
p14
aVthe same agencies,
p15
aVthe same consultants, the same media.
p16
aVThen why is it that they seem to have something different?
p17
aVWhy is it that Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement?
p18
aVHe wasn't the only man who suffered in pre-civil rights America,
p19
aVand he certainly wasn't the only great orator of the day.
p20
aVWhy him?
p21
aVAnd why is it that the Wright brothers
p22
aVwere able to figure out controlled, powered man flight
p23
aVwhen there were certainly other teams
p24
aVwho were better qualified, better funded \u2014
p25
aVand they didn't achieve powered man flight,
p26
aVand the Wright brothers beat them to it.
p27
aVThere's something else at play here.
p28
aa(lp29
VAbout three and a half years ago, I made a discovery.
p30
aVAnd this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the world worked,
p31
aVand it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it.
p32
aVAs it turns out, there's a pattern.
p33
aVAs it turns out, all the great inspiring leaders and organizations in the world,
p34
aVwhether it's Apple or Martin Luther King or the Wright brothers,
p35
aVthey all think, act and communicate the exact same way.
p36
aVAnd it's the complete opposite to everyone else.
p37
aVAll I did was codify it,
p38
aVand it's probably the world's simplest idea.
p39
aVI call it the golden circle.
p40
aa(lp41
VWhy? How? What?
p42
aVThis little idea explains
p43
aVwhy some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren't.
p44
aVLet me define the terms really quickly.
p45
aVEvery single person, every single organization on the planet
p46
aVknows what they do, 100 percent.
p47
aVSome know how they do it,
p48
aVwhether you call it your differentiated value proposition
p49
aVor your proprietary process or your USP.
p50
aVBut very, very few people or organizations know why they do what they do.
p51
aVAnd by "why" I don't mean "to make a profit."
p52
aVThat's a result. It's always a result.
p53
aVBy "why," I mean: What's your purpose?
p54
aVWhat's your cause? What's your belief?
p55
aVWhy does your organization exist?
p56
aVWhy do you get out of bed in the morning?
p57
aVAnd why should anyone care?
p58
aVAs a result, the way we think, we act,
p59
aVthe way we communicate is from the outside in, it's obvious.
p60
aVWe go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing.
p61
aVBut the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations \u2014
p62
aVregardless of their size, regardless of their industry \u2014
p63
aVall think, act and communicate from the inside out.
p64
aa(lp65
VLet me give you an example.
p66
aVI use Apple because they're easy to understand and everybody gets it.
p67
aVIf Apple were like everyone else,
p68
aVa marketing message from them might sound like this:
p69
aV"We make great computers.
p70
aVThey're beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly.
p71
aVWant to buy one?"
p72
aV"Meh."
p73
aVThat's how most of us communicate.
p74
aVThat's how most marketing and sales are done,
p75
aVthat's how we communicate interpersonally.
p76
aVWe say what we do,
p77
aVwe say how we're different or better
p78
aVand we expect some sort of a behavior,
p79
aVa purchase, a vote, something like that.
p80
aVHere's our new law firm:
p81
aVWe have the best lawyers with the biggest clients,
p82
aVwe always perform for our clients.
p83
aVHere's our new car:
p84
aVIt gets great gas mileage, it has leather seats.
p85
aVBuy our car.
p86
aVBut it's uninspiring.
p87
aa(lp88
VHere's how Apple actually communicates.
p89
aV"Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo.
p90
aVWe believe in thinking differently.
p91
aVThe way we challenge the status quo
p92
aVis by making our products beautifully designed,
p93
aVsimple to use and user friendly.
p94
aVWe just happen to make great computers.
p95
aVWant to buy one?"
p96
aVTotally different, right?
p97
aVYou're ready to buy a computer from me.
p98
aVI just reversed the order of the information.
p99
aVWhat it proves to us is that people don't buy what you do;
p100
aVpeople buy why you do it.
p101
aa(lp102
VThis explains why every single person in this room
p103
aVis perfectly comfortable buying a computer from Apple.
p104
aVBut we're also perfectly comfortable
p105
aVbuying an MP3 player from Apple, or a phone from Apple,
p106
aVor a DVR from Apple.
p107
aVAs I said before, Apple's just a computer company.
p108
aVNothing distinguishes them structurally from any of their competitors.
p109
aVTheir competitors are equally qualified to make all of these products.
p110
aVIn fact, they tried.
p111
aVA few years ago, Gateway came out with flat-screen TVs.
p112
aVThey're eminently qualified to make flat-screen TVs.
p113
aVThey've been making flat-screen monitors for years.
p114
aVNobody bought one.
p115
aVDell came out with MP3 players and PDAs,
p116
aVand they make great quality products,
p117
aVand they can make perfectly well-designed products \u2014
p118
aVand nobody bought one.
p119
aVIn fact, talking about it now, we can't even imagine
p120
aVbuying an MP3 player from Dell.
p121
aVWhy would you buy one from a computer company?
p122
aVBut we do it every day.
p123
aVPeople don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.
p124
aVThe goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have.
p125
aVThe goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe.
p126
aa(lp127
VHere's the best part:
p128
aVNone of what I'm telling you is my opinion.
p129
aVIt's all grounded in the tenets of biology.
p130
aVNot psychology, biology.
p131
aVIf you look at a cross-section of the human brain,
p132
aVfrom the top down, the human brain is actually broken
p133
aVinto three major components
p134
aVthat correlate perfectly with the golden circle.
p135
aVOur newest brain, our Homo sapien brain,
p136
aVour neocortex,
p137
aVcorresponds with the "what" level.
p138
aVThe neocortex is responsible
p139
aVfor all of our rational and analytical thought and language.
p140
aVThe middle two sections make up our limbic brains,
p141
aVand our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings,
p142
aVlike trust and loyalty.
p143
aVIt's also responsible for all human behavior,
p144
aVall decision-making,
p145
aVand it has no capacity for language.
p146
aa(lp147
VIn other words, when we communicate from the outside in,
p148
aVyes, people can understand vast amounts of complicated information
p149
aVlike features and benefits and facts and figures.
p150
aVIt just doesn't drive behavior.
p151
aVWhen we can communicate from the inside out,
p152
aVwe're talking directly to the part of the brain
p153
aVthat controls behavior,
p154
aVand then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do.
p155
aVThis is where gut decisions come from.
p156
aVSometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures,
p157
aVand they say, "I know what all the facts and details say,
p158
aVbut it just doesn't feel right."
p159
aVWhy would we use that verb, it doesn't "feel" right?
p160
aVBecause the part of the brain that controls decision-making
p161
aVdoesn't control language.
p162
aVThe best we can muster up is,
p163
aV"I don't know.  It just doesn't feel right."
p164
aVOr sometimes you say you're leading with your heart or soul.
p165
aVI hate to break it to you, those aren't other body parts
p166
aVcontrolling your behavior.
p167
aVIt's all happening here in your limbic brain,
p168
aVthe part of the brain that controls decision-making and not language.
p169
aa(lp170
VBut if you don't know why you do what you do,
p171
aVand people respond to why you do what you do,
p172
aVthen how will you ever get people
p173
aVto vote for you, or buy something from you,
p174
aVor, more importantly, be loyal
p175
aVand want to be a part of what it is that you do.
p176
aVThe goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have;
p177
aVthe goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe.
p178
aVThe goal is not just to hire people who need a job;
p179
aVit's to hire people who believe what you believe.
p180
aVI always say that, you know,
p181
aVif you hire people just because they can do a job, they'll work for your money,
p182
aVbut if they believe what you believe,
p183
aVthey'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears.
p184
aVNowhere else is there a better example than with the Wright brothers.
p185
aa(lp186
VMost people don't know about Samuel Pierpont Langley.
p187
aVAnd back in the early 20th century,
p188
aVthe pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day.
p189
aVEverybody was trying it.
p190
aVAnd Samuel Pierpont Langley had, what we assume,
p191
aVto be the recipe for success.
p192
aVEven now, you ask people,
p193
aV"Why did your product or why did your company fail?"
p194
aVand people always give you the same permutation
p195
aVof the same three things:
p196
aVunder-capitalized, the wrong people, bad market conditions.
p197
aVIt's always the same three things, so let's explore that.
p198
aVSamuel Pierpont Langley
p199
aVwas given 50,000 dollars by the War Department
p200
aVto figure out this flying machine.
p201
aVMoney was no problem.
p202
aVHe held a seat at Harvard
p203
aVand worked at the Smithsonian and was extremely well-connected;
p204
aVhe knew all the big minds of the day.
p205
aVHe hired the best minds money could find
p206
aVand the market conditions were fantastic.
p207
aVThe New York Times followed him around everywhere,
p208
aVand everyone was rooting for Langley.
p209
aVThen how come we've never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley?
p210
aa(lp211
VA few hundred miles away in Dayton, Ohio,
p212
aVOrville and Wilbur Wright,
p213
aVthey had none of what we consider to be the recipe for success.
p214
aVThey had no money;
p215
aVthey paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop.
p216
aVNot a single person on the Wright brothers' team
p217
aVhad a college education,
p218
aVnot even Orville or Wilbur.
p219
aVAnd The New York Times followed them around nowhere.
p220
aa(lp221
VThe difference was,
p222
aVOrville and Wilbur were driven by a cause, by a purpose, by a belief.
p223
aVThey believed that if they could figure out this flying machine,
p224
aVit'll change the course of the world.
p225
aVSamuel Pierpont Langley was different.
p226
aVHe wanted to be rich, and he wanted to be famous.
p227
aVHe was in pursuit of the result.
p228
aVHe was in pursuit of the riches.
p229
aVAnd lo and behold, look what happened.
p230
aVThe people who believed in the Wright brothers' dream
p231
aVworked with them with blood and sweat and tears.
p232
aVThe others just worked for the paycheck.
p233
aVThey tell stories of how every time the Wright brothers went out,
p234
aVthey would have to take five sets of parts,
p235
aVbecause that's how many times they would crash before supper.
p236
aa(lp237
VAnd, eventually, on December 17th, 1903,
p238
aVthe Wright brothers took flight,
p239
aVand no one was there to even experience it.
p240
aVWe found out about it a few days later.
p241
aVAnd further proof that Langley was motivated by the wrong thing:
p242
aVthe day the Wright brothers took flight,
p243
aVhe quit.
p244
aVHe could have said,
p245
aV"That's an amazing discovery, guys,
p246
aVand I will improve upon your technology," but he didn't.
p247
aVHe wasn't first, he didn't get rich, he didn't get famous, so he quit.
p248
aa(lp249
VPeople don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.
p250
aVIf you talk about what you believe,
p251
aVyou will attract those who believe what you believe.
p252
aa(lp253
VBut why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe?
p254
aVSomething called the law of diffusion of innovation,
p255
aVif you don't know the law, you know the terminology.
p256
aVThe first 2.5% of our population are our innovators.
p257
aVThe next 13.5% of our population are our early adopters.
p258
aVThe next 34% are your early majority,
p259
aVyour late majority and your laggards.
p260
aVThe only reason these people buy touch-tone phones
p261
aVis because you can't buy rotary phones anymore.
p262
aa(lp263
V(Laughter)
p264
aa(lp265
VWe all sit at various places at various times on this scale,
p266
aVbut what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us
p267
aVis that if you want mass-market success or mass-market acceptance of an idea,
p268
aVyou cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point
p269
aVbetween 15 and 18 percent market penetration,
p270
aVand then the system tips.
p271
aVI love asking businesses, "What's your conversion on new business?"
p272
aVThey love to tell you, "It's about 10 percent," proudly.
p273
aVWell, you can trip over 10% of the customers.
p274
aVWe all have about 10% who just "get it."
p275
aVThat's how we describe them, right?
p276
aVThat's like that gut feeling, "Oh, they just get it."
p277
aa(lp278
VThe problem is: How do you find the ones that get it
p279
aVbefore doing business versus the ones who don't get it?
p280
aVSo it's this here, this little gap that you have to close,
p281
aVas Jeffrey Moore calls it, "Crossing the Chasm" \u2014
p282
aVbecause, you see, the early majority will not try something
p283
aVuntil someone else has tried it first.
p284
aVAnd these guys, the innovators and the early adopters,
p285
aVthey're comfortable making those gut decisions.
p286
aVThey're more comfortable making those intuitive decisions
p287
aVthat are driven by what they believe about the world
p288
aVand not just what product is available.
p289
aVThese are the people who stood in line for six hours
p290
aVto buy an iPhone when they first came out,
p291
aVwhen you could have bought one off the shelf the next week.
p292
aVThese are the people who spent 40,000 dollars
p293
aVon flat-screen TVs when they first came out,
p294
aVeven though the technology was substandard.
p295
aVAnd, by the way, they didn't do it because the technology was so great;
p296
aVthey did it for themselves.
p297
aVIt's because they wanted to be first.
p298
aVPeople don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it
p299
aVand what you do simply proves what you believe.
p300
aVIn fact, people will do the things that prove what they believe.
p301
aVThe reason that person bought the iPhone in the first six hours,
p302
aVstood in line for six hours,
p303
aVwas because of what they believed about the world,
p304
aVand how they wanted everybody to see them:
p305
aVthey were first.
p306
aVPeople don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.
p307
aa(lp308
VSo let me give you a famous example,
p309
aVa famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation.
p310
aVFirst, the famous failure.
p311
aVIt's a commercial example.
p312
aVAs we said before, the recipe for success
p313
aVis money and the right people and the right market conditions.
p314
aVYou should have success then.
p315
aVLook at TiVo.
p316
aVFrom the time TiVo came out about eight or nine years ago
p317
aVto this current day,
p318
aVthey are the single highest-quality product on the market,
p319
aVhands down, there is no dispute.
p320
aVThey were extremely well-funded.
p321
aVMarket conditions were fantastic.
p322
aVI mean, we use TiVo as verb.
p323
aVI TiVo stuff on my piece-of-junk Time Warner DVR all the time.
p324
aa(lp325
V(Laughter)
p326
aa(lp327
VBut TiVo's a commercial failure.
p328
aVThey've never made money.
p329
aVAnd when they went IPO,
p330
aVtheir stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars
p331
aVand then plummeted, and it's never traded above 10.
p332
aVIn fact, I don't think it's even traded above six,
p333
aVexcept for a couple of little spikes.
p334
aa(lp335
VBecause you see, when TiVo launched their product,
p336
aVthey told us all what they had.
p337
aVThey said, "We have a product that pauses live TV,
p338
aVskips commercials, rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits
p339
aVwithout you even asking."
p340
aVAnd the cynical majority said,
p341
aV"We don't believe you.
p342
aVWe don't need it. We don't like it.
p343
aVYou're scaring us."
p344
aa(lp345
VWhat if they had said,
p346
aV"If you're the kind of person who likes to have total control
p347
aVover every aspect of your life,
p348
aVboy, do we have a product for you.
p349
aVIt pauses live TV, skips commercials,
p350
aVmemorizes your viewing habits, etc., etc."
p351
aVPeople don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it,
p352
aVand what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe.
p353
aa(lp354
VNow let me give you a successful example of the law of diffusion of innovation.
p355
aVIn the summer of 1963,
p356
aV250,000 people showed up on the mall in Washington
p357
aVto hear Dr. King speak.
p358
aVThey sent out no invitations,
p359
aVand there was no website to check the date.
p360
aVHow do you do that?
p361
aVWell, Dr. King wasn't the only man in America
p362
aVwho was a great orator.
p363
aVHe wasn't the only man in America who suffered
p364
aVin a pre-civil rights America.
p365
aVIn fact, some of his ideas were bad.
p366
aVBut he had a gift.
p367
aVHe didn't go around telling people what needed to change in America.
p368
aVHe went around and told people what he believed.
p369
aV"I believe, I believe, I believe," he told people.
p370
aVAnd people who believed what he believed
p371
aVtook his cause, and they made it their own, and they told people.
p372
aVAnd some of those people created structures
p373
aVto get the word out to even more people.
p374
aVAnd lo and behold, 250,000 people showed up
p375
aVon the right day at the right time to hear him speak.
p376
aa(lp377
VHow many of them showed up for him?
p378
aVZero.
p379
aVThey showed up for themselves.
p380
aVIt's what they believed about America
p381
aVthat got them to travel in a bus for eight hours
p382
aVto stand in the sun in Washington in the middle of August.
p383
aVIt's what they believed, and it wasn't about black versus white:
p384
aV25% of the audience was white.
p385
aa(lp386
VDr. King believed that there are two types of laws in this world:
p387
aVthose that are made by a higher authority and those that are made by men.
p388
aVAnd not until all the laws that are made by men
p389
aVare consistent with the laws made by the higher authority
p390
aVwill we live in a just world.
p391
aVIt just so happened that the Civil Rights Movement
p392
aVwas the perfect thing to help him bring his cause to life.
p393
aVWe followed, not for him, but for ourselves.
p394
aVBy the way, he gave the "I have a dream" speech,
p395
aVnot the "I have a plan" speech.
p396
aa(lp397
V(Laughter)
p398
aa(lp399
VListen to politicians now, with their comprehensive 12-point plans.
p400
aVThey're not inspiring anybody.
p401
aVBecause there are leaders and there are those who lead.
p402
aVLeaders hold a position of power or authority,
p403
aVbut those who lead inspire us.
p404
aVWhether they're individuals or organizations,
p405
aVwe follow those who lead, not because we have to,
p406
aVbut because we want to.
p407
aVWe follow those who lead, not for them, but for ourselves.
p408
aVAnd it's those who start with "why"
p409
aVthat have the ability to inspire those around them
p410
aVor find others who inspire them.
p411
aa(lp412
VThank you very much.

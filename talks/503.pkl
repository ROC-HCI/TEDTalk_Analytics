VI was asked by Wilsonart International,
p5
aVa plastic laminate company, which is
p6
aVthe largest plastic laminate company in the world \u2014
p7
aVthey asked me to design
p8
aVa trade show booth
p9
aVfor exhibition at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair
p10
aVin New York, in 2000.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo looking at their three main markets
p13
aVfor their product which were basically
p14
aVtransportation design,
p15
aVinteriors and furniture,
p16
aVwe came up with the solution of taking
p17
aVan old Airstream trailer and gutting it,
p18
aVand trying to portray laminate,
p19
aVand a trailer, in kind of a
p20
aVfresh, new contemporary look.
p21
aVWhen this trailer showed up at my shop
p22
aVin Berkeley, I'd actually never stepped foot in
p23
aVan Airstream trailer, or any other trailer.
p24
aVSo I can be somebody that can look at this
p25
aVin a totally fresh perspective and see if I can
p26
aVoptimize it in its most idealistic fashion.
p27
aVI decided I had to do some research
p28
aVand really figure out what had gone wrong
p29
aVsomewhere along the history of Airstream.
p30
aVWhat I discovered in these interiors is that
p31
aVthere was a disconnect between the exterior shell
p32
aVand the interior architecture of the pieces.
p33
aVIn that the shell was originally conceived
p34
aVas a lightweight, modern, futuristic,
p35
aVhigh-tech pod for hurtling down the freeway, and
p36
aVthe interiors were completely out of sync with that.
p37
aVIn fact it appeared like they
p38
aVreferenced a mountain cabin.
p39
aa(lp40
VThat seemed really like a crisis to me,
p41
aVthat they had never been able to
p42
aVdevelop a vocabulary
p43
aVabout escape, and about travel, and modernity
p44
aVin this trailer that was consistent with the shell.
p45
aVWe really needed to do some archeology
p46
aVin the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic
p47
aVin an Airstream trailer,
p48
aVand what feels like it has true purpose and utility.
p49
aVWe stripped out all the vinyl
p50
aVand zolatone paint that was covering up
p51
aVthis just fantastic aluminum shell.
p52
aVWe took off all the visible hardware and trim
p53
aVthat was kind of doing the country cabin thing.
p54
aVI literally drew on the walls of the trailer,
p55
aVmocked it up in cardboard,
p56
aVwe'd come in and cut, decide things were wrong,
p57
aVpull it out, put it back in.
p58
aa(lp59
VThe main goal was to smooth out the interior,
p60
aVand begin to speak about motion,
p61
aVand mobility, and independence.
p62
aVThe biggest difficulty on one of these trailers
p63
aVis that when you're designing there's actually no
p64
aVlogical place to stop and start materials
p65
aVbecause of the continuous form of the trailer.
p66
aVThere's no such things as two walls and a ceiling
p67
aVcoming together, where you can change materials and shapes.
p68
aVSo that became a challenge.
p69
aVCompounding that,
p70
aVthe material of choice, laminate,
p71
aVthat I was trying to highlight,
p72
aVonly bends in two dimensions.
p73
aVIt's a compound curve interior.
p74
aVWhat I had to devise was
p75
aVa way of fooling the eye
p76
aVinto believing that all these panels
p77
aVare curved with the shell.
p78
aa(lp79
VWhat I came up with was
p80
aVa series of second skins
p81
aVthat basically float over the aluminum shell.
p82
aVAnd what I was trying to do there was
p83
aVdirect your eye in the space,
p84
aVso that you would perceive the geometry in a different way,
p85
aVand that the casework wouldn't break up the space.
p86
aVThey also gave us a way to run power
p87
aVand rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin,
p88
aVso they function as an electrical chase.
p89
aVThat's the trailer, pretty much finished.
p90
aa(lp91
VThat trailer led to another commission,
p92
aVto participate in whats called Tokyo Designers Block.
p93
aVIts a week of furniture design events in Tokyo, in October.
p94
aVTeruo Kurosaki, who owns a furniture company called Idee,
p95
aVhe asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo.
p96
aVHe said one he would like to
p97
aVmake a real trailer, functioning, and we would sell that one.
p98
aVTrailer number two, you have a blank slate, you can to anything you want.
p99
aa(lp100
VWe came up with a fantasy scenario
p101
aVof a DJ traveling around the States,
p102
aVthat would collect records and go on tours.
p103
aVThis trailer housed two turntables,
p104
aVmixer, wet bar, fridge, integrated sound system.
p105
aVIt's got a huge couch, fits quite a few people,
p106
aVand basically we'd had a great time with this.
p107
aVAnd so in this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel,
p108
aVand escape, in an idiosyncratic sense.
p109
aVA lot of these ideas migrated into
p110
aVthe production trailers for Airstream.
p111
aa(lp112
VThis brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream.
p113
aVThey came to me and said,
p114
aV"Well, what can we do to freshen this thing up?
p115
aVAnd do you think kids, you know, skateboarders, surfers,
p116
aVrock climbers, would use these things?"
p117
aVAnd I said, "Well, not in that interior."
p118
aV(Laughter)
p119
aVAnyway, I went out to Airstream
p120
aVabout six times during the process of building this prototype,
p121
aVand it's called the Bambi prototype.
p122
aVI thought, "Finally, oh yeah great,
p123
aVbig company, I'm gonna work with somebody with money
p124
aVfor tooling and molding."
p125
aVAnd I walked in their prototype facility, and
p126
aVit's exactly like my shop, only bigger \u2014
p127
aVsame tools, same things.
p128
aVSo the problem became \u2014 and they set this dilemma to me \u2014
p129
aVthat you have to design the interior using only our existing technology,
p130
aVand there's no money for tooling or molding.
p131
aVThe trailers themselves are actually hand-built.
p132
aVAll the casework is hand-scribed in, uniquely,
p133
aVso you can't just cut 100 parts for 100 trailers,
p134
aVyou have to cut them big, and every single one is hand-fit.
p135
aVThey didn't want to go to a componentized system.
p136
aVAnd there it is, that's the Bambi 16.

VI have one more reason for optimism:
p5
aVclimate change.
p6
aVMaybe you don't believe it, but here is the fact.
p7
aa(lp8
VOn December 12, 2015,
p9
aVin Paris, under the United Nations,
p10
aV195 governments got together
p11
aVand unanimously \u2014
p12
aVif you've worked with governments, you know how difficult that is \u2014
p13
aVunanimously decided
p14
aVto intentionally change the course of the global economy
p15
aVin order to protect the most vulnerable
p16
aVand improve the life of all of us.
p17
aVNow, that is a remarkable achievement.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Applause)
p20
aa(lp21
VBut it is even more remarkable
p22
aVif you consider where we had been just a few years ago.
p23
aV2009, Copenhagen.
p24
aVWho remembers Copenhagen?
p25
aVWell, after years of working toward a climate agreement,
p26
aVthe same governments convened in Copenhagen
p27
aVand failed miserably.
p28
aa(lp29
VWhy did it fail miserably?
p30
aVFor many different reasons,
p31
aVbut primarily because of the deeply entrenched divide
p32
aVbetween the global North and the global South.
p33
aVSo now, six months after this failure,
p34
aVI was called in to assume the responsibility
p35
aVof the global climate change negotiations.
p36
aVYou can imagine, the perfect moment to start this new job.
p37
aVThe global mood on climate change was in the trash can.
p38
aVNo one believed
p39
aVthat a global agreement could ever be possible.
p40
aVIn fact, neither did I.
p41
aVIf you promise not to tell anyone outside of this wonderful TED audience,
p42
aVI'm going to divulge a secret
p43
aVthat has been gratefully buried by history.
p44
aVOn my first press conference,
p45
aVa journalist asked, "Um, Ms. Figueres,
p46
aVdo you think that a global agreement is ever going to be possible?"
p47
aVAnd without engaging brain, I heard me utter,
p48
aV"Not in my lifetime."
p49
aVWell, you can imagine the faces of my press team
p50
aVwho were horrified at this crazy Costa Rican woman
p51
aVwho was their new boss.
p52
aVAnd I was horrified, too.
p53
aVNow, I wasn't horrified at me, because I'm kind of used to myself.
p54
aVI was actually horrified
p55
aVat the consequences of what I had just said,
p56
aVat the consequences for the world
p57
aVin which all our children are going to have to live.
p58
aVIt was frankly a horrible moment for me,
p59
aVand I thought, well, no, hang on,
p60
aVhang on.
p61
aVImpossible is not a fact,
p62
aVit's an attitude.
p63
aVIt's only an attitude.
p64
aVAnd I decided right then and there that I was going to change my attitude
p65
aVand I was going to help the world change its attitude on climate change.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo I don't know \u2014
p68
aVNo, just this? Thanks.
p69
aVI don't know \u2014
p70
aVwhat you would do
p71
aVif you were told your job is to save the planet.
p72
aVPut that on the job description.
p73
aVAnd you have full responsibility,
p74
aVbut you have absolutely no authority,
p75
aVbecause governments are sovereign in every decision that they take.
p76
aa(lp77
VWell, I would really love to know
p78
aVwhat you would do on the first Monday morning,
p79
aVbut here's what I did: I panicked.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd then I panicked again,
p84
aVbecause I realized I have no idea how we're going to solve this problem.
p85
aVAnd then I realized I have no idea how we're going to solve this problem,
p86
aVbut I do know one thing:
p87
aVwe have got to change the tone of this conversation.
p88
aVBecause there is no way you can deliver victory
p89
aVwithout optimism.
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd here,
p92
aVI use optimism as a very simple word,
p93
aVbut let's understand it in its broader sense.
p94
aVLet's understand it as courage,
p95
aVhope, trust, solidarity,
p96
aVthe fundamental belief that we humans can come together
p97
aVand can help each other to better the fate of mankind.
p98
aVWell, you can imagine that I thought that without that,
p99
aVthere was no way we were going to get out of the paralysis of Copenhagen.
p100
aVAnd for six years,
p101
aVI have stubbornly, relentlessly injected optimism into the system,
p102
aVno matter what the questions from the press \u2014
p103
aVand I have gotten better at those \u2014
p104
aVand no matter what the evidence to the contrary.
p105
aVAnd believe you me, there has been a lot of contrary evidence.
p106
aVBut relentless optimism into the system.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd pretty soon,
p109
aVwe began to see changes happening in many areas,
p110
aVprecipitated by thousands of people,
p111
aVincluding many of you here today,
p112
aVand I thank you.
p113
aVAnd this TED community will not be surprised
p114
aVif I tell you the first area
p115
aVin which we saw remarkable change
p116
aVwas ...
p117
aVtechnology.
p118
aVWe began to see that clean technologies,
p119
aVin particular renewable energy technologies,
p120
aVbegan to drop price and increase in capacity,
p121
aVto the point where today we are already building
p122
aVconcentrated solar power plants
p123
aVthat have the capacity to power entire cities,
p124
aVto say nothing of the fact of what we are doing on mobility
p125
aVand intelligent buildings.
p126
aVAnd with this shift in technologies,
p127
aVwe were able to begin to understand
p128
aVthat there was a shift in the economic equation,
p129
aVbecause we were able to recognize
p130
aVthat yes, there are huge costs to climate change,
p131
aVand yes, there are compounded risks.
p132
aVBut there also are economic advantages
p133
aVand intrinsic benefits,
p134
aVbecause the dissemination of the clean technologies
p135
aVis going to bring us cleaner air,
p136
aVbetter health,
p137
aVbetter transportation, more livable cities,
p138
aVmore energy security,
p139
aVmore energy access to the developing world.
p140
aVIn sum, a better world than what we have now.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd with that understanding,
p143
aVyou should have witnessed, in fact, part of you were,
p144
aVthe spread of ingenuity and excitement
p145
aVthat went through, first through nonnational governments,
p146
aVthe private sector, captains of industry, insurance companies,
p147
aVinvestors, city leaders, faith communities,
p148
aVbecause they all began to understand, this actually can be in their interest.
p149
aVThis can actually improve their bottom line.
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd it wasn't just the usual suspects.
p152
aVI have to tell you I had the CEO of a major, major oil and gas company
p153
aVcome to me at the beginning of last year
p154
aVand say \u2014
p155
aVprivately, of course \u2014
p156
aVhe did not know how he was going to change his company,
p157
aVbut he is going to change it,
p158
aVbecause he's interested in long-term viability.
p159
aVWell, now we have a shift in the economic equation,
p160
aVand with that, with broader support from everyone,
p161
aVit did not take very long before we saw that national governments
p162
aVwoke up to the fact that this is in their national interest.
p163
aVAnd when we asked countries to begin to identify
p164
aVhow they could contribute to global efforts
p165
aVbut based on their national interest,
p166
aV189 countries out of 195,
p167
aV189 countries sent their comprehensive climate change plans,
p168
aVbased on their national interest,
p169
aVconcurrent with their priorities,
p170
aVconsistent with their national sustainable development plans.
p171
aa(lp172
VWell,
p173
aVonce you protect the core interests of nations,
p174
aVthen you can understand that nations were ready
p175
aVto begin to converge onto a common path,
p176
aVonto a common direction of travel
p177
aVthat is going to take us probably several decades,
p178
aVbut over those several decades is going to take us
p179
aVinto the new economy,
p180
aVinto a decarbonized, highly resilient economy,
p181
aVAnd the national contributions that are currently on the table
p182
aVon behalf of national governments
p183
aVare insufficient to get us to a stabilized climate,
p184
aVbut they are only the first step,
p185
aVand they will improve over time.
p186
aVAnd the measurement, reporting and verification of all of those efforts
p187
aVis legally binding.
p188
aVAnd the checkpoints that we're going to have every five years
p189
aVto assess collective progress towards our goal are legally binding,
p190
aVand the path itself toward a decarbonized and more resilient economy
p191
aVis legally binding.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd here's the more important part:
p194
aVWhat did we have before?
p195
aVA very small handful of countries
p196
aVwho had undertaken very reduced,
p197
aVshort-term emission reduction commitments
p198
aVthat were completely insufficient
p199
aVand furthermore, largely perceived as a burden.
p200
aVNow what do we have?
p201
aVNow we have all countries of the world contributing with different intensities
p202
aVfrom different approaches in different sectors,
p203
aVbut all of them contributing to a common goal
p204
aVand along a path
p205
aVwith environmental integrity.
p206
aVWell, once you have all of this in place
p207
aVand you have shifted this understanding,
p208
aVthen you see that governments were able to go to Paris
p209
aVand adopt the Paris agreement.
p210
aa(lp211
V(Applause)
p212
aa(lp213
VSo,
p214
aVas I look back
p215
aVover the past six years,
p216
aVfirst I remember
p217
aVthe day the Paris agreement was adopted.
p218
aVI cannot tell you the euphoria in the room.
p219
aV5,000 people jumping out of their seats,
p220
aVcrying, clapping, screaming, yelling,
p221
aVtorn between euphoria and still disbelief at what they had just seen,
p222
aVbecause so many people
p223
aVhad worked for years towards this, and this was finally their reality.
p224
aa(lp225
VAnd it wasn't just those who had participated directly.
p226
aVA few weeks ago, I was with a colleague
p227
aVwho was trying to decide
p228
aVon a Tahitian pearl that he wanted to give to his wonderful wife Natasha.
p229
aVAnd once he had finally decided what he was going to buy,
p230
aVthe jeweler said to him,
p231
aV"You know, you're very lucky that you're buying this now,
p232
aVbecause these pearls could go extinct very soon because of climate change."
p233
aV"But," the jeweler said, "have you heard,
p234
aVthe governments have just come to a decision,
p235
aVand Tahiti could have a chance."
p236
aVWell, what a fantastic confirmation
p237
aVthat perhaps, perhaps here is hope,
p238
aVhere is a possible chance.
p239
aVI'm the first one to recognize that we have a lot of work still to do.
p240
aVWe've only just started our work on climate change.
p241
aVAnd in fact, we need to make sure that we redouble our efforts
p242
aVover the next five years that are the urgent five years.
p243
aVBut I do believe
p244
aVthat we have come over the past six years
p245
aVfrom the impossible
p246
aVto the now unstoppable.
p247
aVAnd how did we do that? By injecting transformational optimism
p248
aVthat allowed us to go from confrontation to collaboration,
p249
aVthat allowed us to understand that national and local interests
p250
aVare not necessarily at odds with global needs,
p251
aVand that if we understand that, we can bring them together
p252
aVand we can merge them harmoniously.
p253
aa(lp254
VAnd as I look forward to other global issues
p255
aVthat will require our attention this century \u2014
p256
aVfood security, water security, home security, forced migration \u2014
p257
aVI see that we certainly do not know
p258
aVhow we are going to solve those problems yet.
p259
aVBut we can take a page out of what we have done on climate change
p260
aVand we can understand
p261
aVthat we have got to reinterpret the zero-sum mentality.
p262
aVBecause we were trained to believe that there always are winners and losers,
p263
aVand that your loss is my gain.
p264
aVWell, now that we're in a world
p265
aVin which we have reached planetary boundaries
p266
aVand that we are not just so interconnected,
p267
aVbut increasingly interdependent on each other,
p268
aVyour loss is no longer my gain.
p269
aVWe're either all losers
p270
aVor we all can be winners.
p271
aVBut we are going to have to decide
p272
aVbetween zero and sum.
p273
aVWe're going to have to decide between zero benefit for all
p274
aVor living life as the sum of all of us.
p275
aVWe've done it once. We can do it again.
p276
aa(lp277
VThanks.

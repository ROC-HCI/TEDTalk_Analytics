VThank you very much.
p5
aVPlease excuse me for sitting; I'm very old.
p6
aV(Laughter)
p7
aVWell, the topic I'm going to discuss
p8
aVis one which is, in a certain sense, very peculiar
p9
aVbecause it's very old.
p10
aVRoughness is part of human life
p11
aVforever and forever,
p12
aVand ancient authors have written about it.
p13
aVIt was very much uncontrollable,
p14
aVand in a certain sense,
p15
aVit seemed to be the extreme of complexity,
p16
aVjust a mess, a mess and a mess.
p17
aVThere are many different kinds of mess.
p18
aVNow, in fact,
p19
aVby a complete fluke,
p20
aVI got involved many years ago
p21
aVin a study of this form of complexity,
p22
aVand to my utter amazement,
p23
aVI found traces \u2014
p24
aVvery strong traces, I must say \u2014
p25
aVof order in that roughness.
p26
aVAnd so today, I would like to present to you
p27
aVa few examples
p28
aVof what this represents.
p29
aVI prefer the word roughness
p30
aVto the word irregularity
p31
aVbecause irregularity \u2014
p32
aVto someone who had Latin
p33
aVin my long-past youth \u2014
p34
aVmeans the contrary of regularity.
p35
aVBut it is not so.
p36
aVRegularity is the contrary of roughness
p37
aVbecause the basic aspect of the world
p38
aVis very rough.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo let me show you a few objects.
p41
aVSome of them are artificial.
p42
aVOthers of them are very real, in a certain sense.
p43
aVNow this is the real. It's a cauliflower.
p44
aVNow why do I show a cauliflower,
p45
aVa very ordinary and ancient vegetable?
p46
aVBecause old and ancient as it may be,
p47
aVit's very complicated and it's very simple,
p48
aVboth at the same time.
p49
aVIf you try to weigh it \u2014 of course it's very easy to weigh it,
p50
aVand when you eat it, the weight matters \u2014
p51
aVbut suppose you try to
p52
aVmeasure its surface.
p53
aVWell, it's very interesting.
p54
aVIf you cut, with a sharp knife,
p55
aVone of the florets of a cauliflower
p56
aVand look at it separately,
p57
aVyou think of a whole cauliflower, but smaller.
p58
aVAnd then you cut again,
p59
aVagain, again, again, again, again, again, again, again,
p60
aVand you still get small cauliflowers.
p61
aVSo the experience of humanity
p62
aVhas always been that there are some shapes
p63
aVwhich have this peculiar property,
p64
aVthat each part is like the whole,
p65
aVbut smaller.
p66
aVNow, what did humanity do with that?
p67
aVVery, very little.
p68
aV(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VSo what I did actually is to
p71
aVstudy this problem,
p72
aVand I found something quite surprising.
p73
aVThat one can measure roughness
p74
aVby a number, a number,
p75
aV2.3, 1.2 and sometimes much more.
p76
aVOne day, a friend of mine,
p77
aVto bug me,
p78
aVbrought a picture and said,
p79
aV"What is the roughness of this curve?"
p80
aVI said, "Well, just short of 1.5."
p81
aVIt was 1.48.
p82
aVNow, it didn't take me any time.
p83
aVI've been looking at these things for so long.
p84
aVSo these numbers are the numbers
p85
aVwhich denote the roughness of these surfaces.
p86
aVI hasten to say that these surfaces
p87
aVare completely artificial.
p88
aVThey were done on a computer,
p89
aVand the only input is a number,
p90
aVand that number is roughness.
p91
aVSo on the left,
p92
aVI took the roughness copied from many landscapes.
p93
aVTo the right, I took a higher roughness.
p94
aVSo the eye, after a while,
p95
aVcan distinguish these two very well.
p96
aa(lp97
VHumanity had to learn about measuring roughness.
p98
aVThis is very rough, and this is sort of smooth, and this perfectly smooth.
p99
aVVery few things are very smooth.
p100
aVSo then if you try to ask questions:
p101
aV"What's the surface of a cauliflower?"
p102
aVWell, you measure and measure and measure.
p103
aVEach time you're closer, it gets bigger,
p104
aVdown to very, very small distances.
p105
aVWhat's the length of the coastline
p106
aVof these lakes?
p107
aVThe closer you measure, the longer it is.
p108
aVThe concept of length of coastline,
p109
aVwhich seems to be so natural
p110
aVbecause it's given in many cases,
p111
aVis, in fact, complete fallacy; there's no such thing.
p112
aVYou must do it differently.
p113
aa(lp114
VWhat good is that, to know these things?
p115
aVWell, surprisingly enough,
p116
aVit's good in many ways.
p117
aVTo begin with, artificial landscapes,
p118
aVwhich I invented sort of,
p119
aVare used in cinema all the time.
p120
aVWe see mountains in the distance.
p121
aVThey may be mountains, but they may be just formulae, just cranked on.
p122
aVNow it's very easy to do.
p123
aVIt used to be very time-consuming, but now it's nothing.
p124
aVNow look at that. That's a real lung.
p125
aVNow a lung is something very strange.
p126
aVIf you take this thing,
p127
aVyou know very well it weighs very little.
p128
aVThe volume of a lung is very small,
p129
aVbut what about the area of the lung?
p130
aVAnatomists were arguing very much about that.
p131
aVSome say that a normal male's lung
p132
aVhas an area of the inside
p133
aVof a basketball [court].
p134
aVAnd the others say, no, five basketball [courts].
p135
aVEnormous disagreements.
p136
aVWhy so? Because, in fact, the area of the lung
p137
aVis something very ill-defined.
p138
aVThe bronchi branch, branch, branch
p139
aVand they stop branching,
p140
aVnot because of any matter of principle,
p141
aVbut because of physical considerations:
p142
aVthe mucus, which is in the lung.
p143
aVSo what happens is that in a way
p144
aVyou have a much bigger lung,
p145
aVbut it branches and branches
p146
aVdown to distances about the same for a whale, for a man
p147
aVand for a little rodent.
p148
aa(lp149
VNow, what good is it to have that?
p150
aVWell, surprisingly enough, amazingly enough,
p151
aVthe anatomists had a very poor idea
p152
aVof the structure of the lung until very recently.
p153
aVAnd I think that my mathematics,
p154
aVsurprisingly enough,
p155
aVhas been of great help
p156
aVto the surgeons
p157
aVstudying lung illnesses
p158
aVand also kidney illnesses,
p159
aVall these branching systems,
p160
aVfor which there was no geometry.
p161
aVSo I found myself, in other words,
p162
aVconstructing a geometry,
p163
aVa geometry of things which had no geometry.
p164
aVAnd a surprising aspect of it
p165
aVis that very often, the rules of this geometry
p166
aVare extremely short.
p167
aVYou have formulas that long.
p168
aVAnd you crank it several times.
p169
aVSometimes repeatedly: again, again, again,
p170
aVthe same repetition.
p171
aVAnd at the end, you get things like that.
p172
aa(lp173
VThis cloud is completely,
p174
aV100 percent artificial.
p175
aVWell, 99.9.
p176
aVAnd the only part which is natural
p177
aVis a number, the roughness of the cloud,
p178
aVwhich is taken from nature.
p179
aVSomething so complicated like a cloud,
p180
aVso unstable, so varying,
p181
aVshould have a simple rule behind it.
p182
aVNow this simple rule
p183
aVis not an explanation of clouds.
p184
aVThe seer of clouds had to
p185
aVtake account of it.
p186
aVI don't know how much advanced
p187
aVthese pictures are. They're old.
p188
aVI was very much involved in it,
p189
aVbut then turned my attention to other phenomena.
p190
aa(lp191
VNow, here is another thing
p192
aVwhich is rather interesting.
p193
aVOne of the shattering events
p194
aVin the history of mathematics,
p195
aVwhich is not appreciated by many people,
p196
aVoccurred about 130 years ago,
p197
aV145 years ago.
p198
aVMathematicians began to create
p199
aVshapes that didn't exist.
p200
aVMathematicians got into self-praise
p201
aVto an extent which was absolutely amazing,
p202
aVthat man can invent things
p203
aVthat nature did not know.
p204
aVIn particular, it could invent
p205
aVthings like a curve which fills the plane.
p206
aVA curve's a curve, a plane's a plane,
p207
aVand the two won't mix.
p208
aVWell, they do mix.
p209
aVA man named Peano
p210
aVdid define such curves,
p211
aVand it became an object of extraordinary interest.
p212
aVIt was very important, but mostly interesting
p213
aVbecause a kind of break,
p214
aVa separation between
p215
aVthe mathematics coming from reality, on the one hand,
p216
aVand new mathematics coming from pure man's mind.
p217
aVWell, I was very sorry to point out
p218
aVthat the pure man's mind
p219
aVhas, in fact,
p220
aVseen at long last
p221
aVwhat had been seen for a long time.
p222
aVAnd so here I introduce something,
p223
aVthe set of rivers of a plane-filling curve.
p224
aVAnd well,
p225
aVit's a story unto itself.
p226
aVSo it was in 1875 to 1925,
p227
aVan extraordinary period
p228
aVin which mathematics prepared itself to break out from the world.
p229
aVAnd the objects which were used
p230
aVas examples, when I was
p231
aVa child and a student, as examples
p232
aVof the break between mathematics
p233
aVand visible reality \u2014
p234
aVthose objects,
p235
aVI turned them completely around.
p236
aVI used them for describing
p237
aVsome of the aspects of the complexity of nature.
p238
aa(lp239
VWell, a man named Hausdorff in 1919
p240
aVintroduced a number which was just a mathematical joke,
p241
aVand I found that this number
p242
aVwas a good measurement of roughness.
p243
aVWhen I first told it to my friends in mathematics
p244
aVthey said, "Don't be silly. It's just something [silly]."
p245
aVWell actually, I was not silly.
p246
aVThe great painter Hokusai knew it very well.
p247
aVThe things on the ground are algae.
p248
aVHe did not know the mathematics; it didn't yet exist.
p249
aVAnd he was Japanese who had no contact with the West.
p250
aVBut painting for a long time had a fractal side.
p251
aVI could speak of that for a long time.
p252
aVThe Eiffel Tower has a fractal aspect.
p253
aVI read the book that Mr. Eiffel wrote about his tower,
p254
aVand indeed it was astonishing how much he understood.
p255
aa(lp256
VThis is a mess, mess, mess, Brownian loop.
p257
aVOne day I decided \u2014
p258
aVhalfway through my career,
p259
aVI was held by so many things in my work \u2014
p260
aVI decided to test myself.
p261
aVCould I just look at something
p262
aVwhich everybody had been looking at for a long time
p263
aVand find something dramatically new?
p264
aVWell, so I looked at these
p265
aVthings called Brownian motion \u2014 just goes around.
p266
aVI played with it for a while,
p267
aVand I made it return to the origin.
p268
aVThen I was telling my assistant,
p269
aV"I don't see anything. Can you paint it?"
p270
aVSo he painted it, which means
p271
aVhe put inside everything. He said:
p272
aV"Well, this thing came out ..." And I said, "Stop! Stop! Stop!
p273
aVI see; it's an island."
p274
aVAnd amazing.
p275
aVSo Brownian motion, which happens to have
p276
aVa roughness number of two, goes around.
p277
aVI measured it, 1.33.
p278
aVAgain, again, again.
p279
aVLong measurements, big Brownian motions,
p280
aV1.33.
p281
aVMathematical problem: how to prove it?
p282
aVIt took my friends 20 years.
p283
aVThree of them were having incomplete proofs.
p284
aVThey got together, and together they had the proof.
p285
aVSo they got the big [Fields] medal in mathematics,
p286
aVone of the three medals that people have received
p287
aVfor proving things which I've seen
p288
aVwithout being able to prove them.
p289
aa(lp290
VNow everybody asks me at one point or another,
p291
aV"How did it all start?
p292
aVWhat got you in that strange business?"
p293
aVWhat got you to be,
p294
aVat the same time, a mechanical engineer,
p295
aVa geographer
p296
aVand a mathematician and so on, a physicist?
p297
aVWell actually I started, oddly enough,
p298
aVstudying stock market prices.
p299
aVAnd so here
p300
aVI had this theory,
p301
aVand I wrote books about it \u2014
p302
aVfinancial prices increments.
p303
aVTo the left you see data over a long period.
p304
aVTo the right, on top,
p305
aVyou see a theory which is very, very fashionable.
p306
aVIt was very easy, and you can write many books very fast about it.
p307
aV(Laughter)
p308
aVThere are thousands of books on that.
p309
aVNow compare that with real price increments.
p310
aVWhere are real price increments?
p311
aVWell, these other lines
p312
aVinclude some real price increments
p313
aVand some forgery which I did.
p314
aVSo the idea there was
p315
aVthat one must be able to \u2014 how do you say? \u2014
p316
aVmodel price variation.
p317
aVAnd it went really well 50 years ago.
p318
aVFor 50 years, people were sort of pooh-poohing me
p319
aVbecause they could do it much, much easier.
p320
aVBut I tell you, at this point, people listened to me.
p321
aV(Laughter)
p322
aVThese two curves are averages:
p323
aVStandard & Poor, the blue one;
p324
aVand the red one is Standard & Poor's
p325
aVfrom which the five biggest discontinuities
p326
aVare taken out.
p327
aVNow discontinuities are a nuisance,
p328
aVso in many studies of prices,
p329
aVone puts them aside.
p330
aV"Well, acts of God.
p331
aVAnd you have the little nonsense which is left.
p332
aVActs of God." In this picture,
p333
aVfive acts of God are as important as everything else.
p334
aVIn other words,
p335
aVit is not acts of God that we should put aside.
p336
aVThat is the meat, the problem.
p337
aVIf you master these, you master price,
p338
aVand if you don't master these, you can master
p339
aVthe little noise as well as you can,
p340
aVbut it's not important.
p341
aVWell, here are the curves for it.
p342
aa(lp343
VNow, I get to the final thing, which is the set
p344
aVof which my name is attached.
p345
aVIn a way, it's the story of my life.
p346
aVMy adolescence was spent
p347
aVduring the German occupation of France.
p348
aVSince I thought that I might
p349
aVvanish within a day or a week,
p350
aVI had very big dreams.
p351
aVAnd after the war,
p352
aVI saw an uncle again.
p353
aVMy uncle was a very prominent mathematician, and he told me,
p354
aV"Look, there's a problem
p355
aVwhich I could not solve 25 years ago,
p356
aVand which nobody can solve.
p357
aVThis is a construction of a man named [Gaston] Julia
p358
aVand [Pierre] Fatou.
p359
aVIf you could
p360
aVfind something new, anything,
p361
aVyou will get your career made."
p362
aVVery simple.
p363
aVSo I looked,
p364
aVand like the thousands of people that had tried before,
p365
aVI found nothing.
p366
aa(lp367
VBut then the computer came,
p368
aVand I decided to apply the computer,
p369
aVnot to new problems in mathematics \u2014
p370
aVlike this wiggle wiggle, that's a new problem \u2014
p371
aVbut to old problems.
p372
aVAnd I went from what's called
p373
aVreal numbers, which are points on a line,
p374
aVto imaginary, complex numbers,
p375
aVwhich are points on a plane,
p376
aVwhich is what one should do there,
p377
aVand this shape came out.
p378
aVThis shape is of an extraordinary complication.
p379
aVThe equation is hidden there,
p380
aVz goes into z squared, plus c.
p381
aVIt's so simple, so dry.
p382
aVIt's so uninteresting.
p383
aVNow you turn the crank once, twice:
p384
aVtwice,
p385
aVmarvels come out.
p386
aVI mean this comes out.
p387
aVI don't want to explain these things.
p388
aVThis comes out. This comes out.
p389
aVShapes which are of such complication,
p390
aVsuch harmony and such beauty.
p391
aVThis comes out
p392
aVrepeatedly, again, again, again.
p393
aVAnd that was one of my major discoveries,
p394
aVto find that these islands were the same
p395
aVas the whole big thing, more or less.
p396
aVAnd then you get these
p397
aVextraordinary baroque decorations all over the place.
p398
aVAll that from this little formula,
p399
aVwhich has whatever, five symbols in it.
p400
aVAnd then this one.
p401
aVThe color was added for two reasons.
p402
aVFirst of all, because these shapes
p403
aVare so complicated
p404
aVthat one couldn't make any sense of the numbers.
p405
aVAnd if you plot them, you must choose some system.
p406
aVAnd so my principle has been
p407
aVto always present the shapes
p408
aVwith different colorings
p409
aVbecause some colorings emphasize that,
p410
aVand others it is that or that.
p411
aVIt's so complicated.
p412
aa(lp413
V(Laughter)
p414
aa(lp415
VIn 1990, I was in Cambridge, U.K.
p416
aVto receive a prize from the university,
p417
aVand three days later,
p418
aVa pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing.
p419
aVSo where did this come from?
p420
aVObviously, from extraterrestrials.
p421
aV(Laughter)
p422
aVWell, so the newspaper in Cambridge
p423
aVpublished an article about that "discovery"
p424
aVand received the next day
p425
aV5,000 letters from people saying,
p426
aV"But that's simply a Mandelbrot set very big."
p427
aa(lp428
VWell, let me finish.
p429
aVThis shape here just came
p430
aVout of an exercise in pure mathematics.
p431
aVBottomless wonders spring from simple rules,
p432
aVwhich are repeated without end.
p433
aa(lp434
VThank you very much.

Mandelbrot coined the term &quot;fractal&quot; to describe these objects, and set about sharing his insight with the world.<br /><br />The Mandelbrot set (expressed as z&sup2; + c) was named in Mandelbrot&#39;s honor by Adrien Douady and John H. Hubbard. Its boundary can be magnified infinitely and yet remain magnificently complicated, and its elegant shape made it <strong>a poster child for the popular understanding of fractals</strong>.

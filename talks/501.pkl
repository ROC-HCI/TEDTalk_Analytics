VNewspapers are dying for a few reasons.
p5
aVReaders don't want to pay for yesterday's news, and advertisers follow them.
p6
aVYour iPhone, your laptop,
p7
aVis much more handy than New York Times on Sunday.
p8
aVAnd we should save trees in the end.
p9
aVSo it's enough to bury any industry.
p10
aVSo, should we rather ask, "Can anything save newspapers?"
p11
aa(lp12
VThere are several scenarios for the future newspaper.
p13
aVSome people say it should be free;
p14
aVit should be tabloid, or even smaller: A4;
p15
aVit should be local, run by communities,
p16
aVor niche, for some smaller groups like business \u2014
p17
aVbut then it's not free; it's very expensive.
p18
aVIt should be opinion-driven;
p19
aVless news, more views.
p20
aVAnd we'd rather read it during breakfast,
p21
aVbecause later we listen to radio in a car,
p22
aVcheck your mail at work and in the evening you watch TV.
p23
aVSounds nice, but this can only buy time.
p24
aVBecause in the long run,
p25
aVI think there is no reason, no practical reason
p26
aVfor newspapers to survive.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo what can we do?
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aVLet me tell you my story.
p31
aV20 years ago, Bonnier, Swedish publisher,
p32
aVstarted to set newspapers in the former Soviet Bloc.
p33
aVAfter a few years, they had several newspapers in central and eastern Europe.
p34
aVThey were run by an inexperienced staff,
p35
aVwith no visual culture, no budgets for visuals \u2014
p36
aVin many places there were not even art directors.
p37
aVI decided to be \u2014 to work for them as an art director.
p38
aVBefore, I was an architect, and my grandmother asked me once,
p39
aV"What are you doing for a living?"
p40
aVI said, "I'm designing newspapers."
p41
aV"What? There's nothing to design there. It's just boring letters"
p42
aV(Laughter)
p43
aVAnd she was right. I was very frustrated, until one day.
p44
aa(lp45
VI came to London, and I've seen performance by Cirque du Soleil.
p46
aVAnd I had a revelation. I thought,
p47
aV"These guys took some creepy,
p48
aVrun-down entertainment,
p49
aVand put it to the highest possible level of performance art."
p50
aVI thought "Oh my God, maybe I can do the same with these boring newspapers."
p51
aVAnd I did. We started to redesign them, one by one.
p52
aVThe front page became our signature.
p53
aVIt was my personal intimate channel to talk to the readers.
p54
aa(lp55
VI'm not going to tell you stories about teamwork or cooperation.
p56
aVMy approach was very egotistic.
p57
aVI wanted my artistic statement,
p58
aVmy interpretation of reality.
p59
aVI wanted to make posters, not newspapers.
p60
aVNot even magazines: posters.
p61
aVWe were experimenting with type,
p62
aVwith illustration, with photos. And we had fun.
p63
aVSoon it started to bring results.
p64
aVIn Poland, our pages were named
p65
aV"Covers of the Year" three times in a row.
p66
aVOther examples you can see here are from
p67
aVLatvia, Lithuania, Estonia \u2014
p68
aVthe central European countries.
p69
aa(lp70
VBut it's not only about the front page.
p71
aVThe secret is that we were treating
p72
aVthe whole newspaper as one piece,
p73
aVas one composition \u2014 like music.
p74
aVAnd music has a rhythm, has ups and downs.
p75
aVAnd design is responsible for this experience.
p76
aVFlipping through pages is readers experience,
p77
aVand I'm responsible for this experience.
p78
aVWe treated two pages, both spreads, as a one page,
p79
aVbecause that's how readers perceive it.
p80
aa(lp81
VYou can see some Russian pages here which got many awards
p82
aVon biggest infographic competition in Spain.
p83
aVBut the real award came from Society for Newspaper Design.
p84
aVJust a year after redesigning this newspaper in Poland,
p85
aVthey name it the World's Best-Designed Newspaper.
p86
aVAnd two years later,
p87
aVthe same award came to Estonia.
p88
aVIsn't amazing?
p89
aa(lp90
VWhat really makes it amazing: that the circulation of these newspapers
p91
aVwere growing too.
p92
aVJust some examples:
p93
aVin Russia, plus 11 after one year,
p94
aVplus 29 after three years of the redesign.
p95
aVSame in Poland: plus 13, up to 35 percent
p96
aVraise of circulation after three years.
p97
aVYou can see on a graph,
p98
aVafter years of stagnation, the paper started to grow,
p99
aVjust after redesign.
p100
aVBut the real hit was in Bulgaria.
p101
aVAnd that is really amazing.
p102
aa(lp103
VDid design do this?
p104
aVDesign was just a part of the process.
p105
aVAnd the process we made was not about changing the look,
p106
aVit was about improving the product completely.
p107
aVI took an architectural rule about function and form
p108
aVand translated it into newspaper content and design.
p109
aVAnd I put strategy at the top of it.
p110
aVSo first you ask a big question: why we do it? What is the goal?
p111
aVThen we adjust the content accordingly.
p112
aVAnd then, usually after two months, we start designing.
p113
aVMy bosses, in the beginning, were very surprised.
p114
aVWhy am I asking all of these business questions,
p115
aVinstead of just showing them pages?
p116
aVBut soon they realized that this is the new role of designer:
p117
aVto be in this process from the very beginning to the very end.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo what is the lesson behind it?
p120
aVThe first lesson is about that design can change not just your product.
p121
aVIt can change your workflow \u2014 actually, it can change everything in your company;
p122
aVit can turn your company upside down.
p123
aVIt can even change you.
p124
aVAnd who's responsible? Designers.
p125
aVGive power to designers.
p126
aV(Applause)
p127
aVBut the second is even more important.
p128
aVYou can live in a small poor country, like me.
p129
aVYou can work for a small company,
p130
aVin a boring branch.
p131
aVYou can have no budgets, no people \u2014
p132
aVbut still can put your work to the highest possible level.
p133
aVAnd everybody can do it.
p134
aVYou just need inspiration, vision and determination.
p135
aVAnd you need to remember that to be good
p136
aVis not enough.
p137
aa(lp138
VThank you.

(At this point, why not try it?) In his work, he&#39;s proved that <strong>good design can help readers reconnect with newspapers</strong>. A former architect, Utko took on the job of redesigning several newspapers in former Soviet Bloc nations, starting from basic principles. He worked closely with newspaper executives to figure out the business goals of their papers, and then radically reformatted the product to fit those goals. (And he wasn&#39;t afraid to break a few grids in the process.)</p><p>As the art director at Warsaw&#39;s<em> Puls Biznesu</em> in 2004, he redesigned this small business-focused newspaper and immediately won the SND award for world&#39;s best-designed newspaper. Readers responded, and <strong>circulation went up</strong>. He&#39;s now art director for the Bonnier Business Press, overseeing papers in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states, and the work he oversees consistently wins major prizes (including another SND world&#39;s-best in 2007 for Estonia&#39;s <em>&Auml;rip&auml;ev</em>), despite their small teams and limited resources.</p>", "slug": "jacek_utko", "whotheyare": "Could good design save the newspaper -- at least for now?

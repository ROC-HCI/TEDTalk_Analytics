VLet's talk dirty.
p5
aVA few years ago, oddly enough,
p6
aVI needed the bathroom,
p7
aVand I found one, a public bathroom,
p8
aVand I went into the stall,
p9
aVand I prepared to do what I'd done most of my life:
p10
aVuse the toilet, flush the toilet, forget about the toilet.
p11
aVAnd for some reason that day, instead,
p12
aVI asked myself a question,
p13
aVand it was, where does this stuff go?
p14
aVAnd with that question, I found myself plunged
p15
aVinto the world of sanitation \u2014
p16
aVthere's more coming \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p17
aVsanitation, toilets and poop,
p18
aVand I have yet to emerge.
p19
aVAnd that's because it's such an enraging,
p20
aVyet engaging place to be.
p21
aa(lp22
VTo go back to that toilet,
p23
aVit wasn't a particularly fancy toilet,
p24
aVit wasn't as nice as this one
p25
aVfrom the World Toilet Organization.
p26
aVThat's the other WTO. (Laughter)
p27
aVBut it had a lockable door, it had privacy, it had water,
p28
aVit had soap so I could wash my hands,
p29
aVand I did because I'm a woman, and we do that.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p32
aa(lp33
VBut that day, when I asked that question,
p34
aVI learned something, and that was that I'd grown up thinking
p35
aVthat a toilet like that was my right,
p36
aVwhen in fact it's a privilege.
p37
aV2.5 billion people worldwide have no adequate toilet.
p38
aVThey don't have a bucket or a box.
p39
aVForty percent of the world with no adequate toilet.
p40
aVAnd they have to do what this little boy is doing
p41
aVby the side of the Mumbai Airport expressway,
p42
aVwhich is called open defecation,
p43
aVor poo-pooing in the open.
p44
aVAnd he does that every day,
p45
aVand every day, probably, that guy in the picture
p46
aVwalks on by,
p47
aVbecause he sees that little boy, but he doesn't see him.
p48
aa(lp49
VBut he should, because the problem
p50
aVwith all that poop lying around
p51
aVis that poop carries passengers.
p52
aVFifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit.
p53
aVAll those things, the eggs, the cysts,
p54
aVthe bacteria, the viruses, all those can travel
p55
aVin one gram of human feces.
p56
aVHow? Well, that little boy will not have washed his hands.
p57
aVHe's barefoot. He'll run back into his house,
p58
aVand he will contaminate his drinking water and his food
p59
aVand his environment
p60
aVwith whatever diseases he may be carrying
p61
aVby fecal particles that are on his fingers and feet.
p62
aVIn what I call the flushed-and-plumbed world
p63
aVthat most of us in this room are lucky to live in,
p64
aVthe most common symptoms associated with those diseases,
p65
aVdiarrhea, is now a bit of a joke.
p66
aVIt's the runs, the Hershey squirts, the squits.
p67
aVWhere I come from, we call it Delhi belly,
p68
aVas a legacy of empire.
p69
aVBut if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea
p70
aVin a leading photo image agency,
p71
aVthis is the picture that you come up with.
p72
aV(Laughter)
p73
aVStill not sure about the bikini.
p74
aVAnd here's another image of diarrhea.
p75
aVThis is Marie Saylee, nine months old.
p76
aVYou can't see her, because she's buried
p77
aVunder that green grass in a little village in Liberia,
p78
aVbecause she died in three days from diarrhea \u2014
p79
aVthe Hershey squirts, the runs, a joke.
p80
aVAnd that's her dad.
p81
aVBut she wasn't alone that day,
p82
aVbecause 4,000 other children died of diarrhea,
p83
aVand they do every day.
p84
aVDiarrhea is the second biggest killer of children worldwide,
p85
aVand you've probably been asked to care about things
p86
aVlike HIV/AIDS or T.B. or measles,
p87
aVbut diarrhea kills more children
p88
aVthan all those three things put together.
p89
aVIt's a very potent weapon of mass destruction.
p90
aVAnd the cost to the world is immense:
p91
aV260 billion dollars lost every year
p92
aVon the losses to poor sanitation.
p93
aVThese are cholera beds in Haiti.
p94
aVYou'll have heard of cholera, but we don't hear about diarrhea.
p95
aVIt gets a fraction of the attention and funding
p96
aVgiven to any of those other diseases.
p97
aa(lp98
VBut we know how to fix this.
p99
aVWe know, because in the mid-19th century,
p100
aVwonderful Victorian engineers
p101
aVinstalled systems of sewers and wastewater treatment
p102
aVand the flush toilet, and disease dropped dramatically.
p103
aVChild mortality dropped by the most
p104
aVit had ever dropped in history.
p105
aVThe flush toilet was voted the best medical advance
p106
aVof the last 200 years by the readers of the British Medical Journal,
p107
aVand they were choosing over the Pill, anesthesia,
p108
aVand surgery.
p109
aVIt's a wonderful waste disposal device.
p110
aa(lp111
VBut I think that it's so good \u2014 it doesn't smell,
p112
aVwe can put it in our house, we can lock it behind a door \u2014
p113
aVand I think we've locked it out of conversation too.
p114
aVWe don't have a neutral word for it.
p115
aVPoop's not particularly adequate.
p116
aVShit offends people. Feces is too medical.
p117
aa(lp118
VBecause I can't explain otherwise,
p119
aVwhen I look at the figures, what's going on.
p120
aVWe know how to solve diarrhea and sanitation,
p121
aVbut if you look at the budgets of countries,
p122
aVdeveloping and developed,
p123
aVyou'll think there's something wrong with the math,
p124
aVbecause you'll expect absurdities like
p125
aVPakistan spending 47 times more on its military
p126
aVthan it does on water and sanitation,
p127
aVeven though 150,000 children die of diarrhea
p128
aVin Pakistan every year.
p129
aVBut then you look at that already minuscule
p130
aVwater and sanitation budget,
p131
aVand 75 to 90 percent of it will go on clean water supply,
p132
aVwhich is great; we all need water.
p133
aVNo one's going to refuse clean water.
p134
aVBut the humble latrine, or flush toilet,
p135
aVreduces disease by twice as much
p136
aVas just putting in clean water.
p137
aVThink about it. That little boy
p138
aVwho's running back into his house,
p139
aVhe may have a nice, clean fresh water supply,
p140
aVbut he's got dirty hands that he's going to contaminate his water supply with.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd I think that the real waste of human waste
p143
aVis that we are wasting it as a resource
p144
aVand as an incredible trigger for development,
p145
aVbecause these are a few things that toilets
p146
aVand poop itself can do for us.
p147
aVSo a toilet can put a girl back in school.
p148
aVTwenty-five percent of girls in India drop out of school
p149
aVbecause they have no adequate sanitation.
p150
aVThey've been used to sitting through lessons
p151
aVfor years and years holding it in.
p152
aVWe've all done that, but they do it every day,
p153
aVand when they hit puberty and they start menstruating,
p154
aVit just gets too much.
p155
aVAnd I understand that. Who can blame them?
p156
aVSo if you met an educationalist and said,
p157
aV"I can improve education attendance rates by 25 percent
p158
aVwith just one simple thing,"
p159
aVyou'd make a lot of friends in education.
p160
aa(lp161
VThat's not the only thing it can do for you.
p162
aVPoop can cook your dinner.
p163
aVIt's got nutrients in it.
p164
aVWe ingest nutrients. We excrete nutrients as well.
p165
aVWe don't keep them all.
p166
aVIn Rwanda, they are now getting
p167
aV75 percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system
p168
aVfrom the contents of prisoners' bowels.
p169
aVSo these are a bunch of inmates in a prison in Butare.
p170
aVThey're genocidal inmates, most of them,
p171
aVand they're stirring the contents of their own latrines,
p172
aVbecause if you put poop in a sealed environment, in a tank,
p173
aVpretty much like a stomach,
p174
aVthen, pretty much like a stomach, it gives off gas,
p175
aVand you can cook with it.
p176
aVAnd you might think it's just good karma
p177
aVto see these guys stirring shit,
p178
aVbut it's also good economic sense,
p179
aVbecause they're saving a million dollars a year.
p180
aVThey're cutting down on deforestation,
p181
aVand they've found a fuel supply that is inexhaustible,
p182
aVinfinite and free at the point of production.
p183
aa(lp184
VIt's not just in the poor world that poop can save lives.
p185
aVHere's a woman who's about to get a dose
p186
aVof the brown stuff in those syringes,
p187
aVwhich is what you think it is,
p188
aVexcept not quite, because it's actually donated.
p189
aVThere is now a new career path called stool donor.
p190
aVIt's like the new sperm donor.
p191
aVBecause she has been suffering from a superbug called C. diff,
p192
aVand it's resistant to antibiotics in many cases.
p193
aVShe's been suffering for years.
p194
aVShe gets a dose of healthy human feces,
p195
aVand the cure rate for this procedure is 94 percent.
p196
aVIt's astonishing, but hardly anyone is still doing it.
p197
aVMaybe it's the ick factor.
p198
aVThat's okay, because there's a team of research scientists
p199
aVin Canada who have now created a stool sample,
p200
aVa fake stool sample which is called RePOOPulate.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo you'd be thinking by now, okay, the solution's simple,
p203
aVwe give everyone a toilet.
p204
aVAnd this is where it gets really interesting,
p205
aVbecause it's not that simple, because we are not simple.
p206
aVSo the really interesting, exciting work \u2014
p207
aVthis is the engaging bit \u2014 in sanitation is that
p208
aVwe need to understand human psychology.
p209
aVWe need to understand software
p210
aVas well as just giving someone hardware.
p211
aVThey've found in many developing countries that
p212
aVgovernments have gone in and given out free latrines
p213
aVand gone back a few years later and found that they've
p214
aVgot lots of new goat sheds or temples or spare rooms
p215
aVwith their owners happily walking past them
p216
aVand going over to the open defecating ground.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo the idea is to manipulate human emotion.
p219
aVIt's been done for decades. The soap companies did it
p220
aVin the early 20th century.
p221
aVThey tried selling soap as healthy. No one bought it.
p222
aVThey tried selling it as sexy. Everyone bought it.
p223
aVIn India now there's a campaign
p224
aVwhich persuades young brides
p225
aVnot to marry into families that don't have a toilet.
p226
aVIt's called "No Loo, No I Do."
p227
aV(Laughter)
p228
aVAnd in case you think that poster's just propaganda,
p229
aVhere's Priyanka, 23 years old.
p230
aVI met her last October in India,
p231
aVand she grew up in a conservative environment.
p232
aVShe grew up in a rural village in a poor area of India,
p233
aVand she was engaged at 14, and then at 21 or so,
p234
aVshe moved into her in-law's house.
p235
aVAnd she was horrified to get there and find
p236
aVthat they didn't have a toilet.
p237
aVShe'd grown up with a latrine.
p238
aVIt was no big deal, but it was a latrine.
p239
aVAnd the first night she was there, she was told
p240
aVthat at 4 o'clock in the morning \u2014
p241
aVher mother-in-law got her up, told her to go outside
p242
aVand go and do it in the dark in the open.
p243
aVAnd she was scared. She was scared of drunks hanging around.
p244
aVShe was scared of snakes. She was scared of rape.
p245
aVAfter three days, she did an unthinkable thing.
p246
aVShe left.
p247
aVAnd if you know anything about rural India,
p248
aVyou'll know that's an unspeakably courageous thing to do.
p249
aVBut not just that.
p250
aVShe got her toilet, and now she goes around
p251
aVall the other villages in India
p252
aVpersuading other women to do the same thing.
p253
aVIt's what I call social contagion, and it's really powerful
p254
aVand really exciting.
p255
aa(lp256
VAnother version of this, another village in India
p257
aVnear where Priyanka lives
p258
aVis this village, called Lakara, and about a year ago,
p259
aVit had no toilets whatsoever.
p260
aVKids were dying of diarrhea and cholera.
p261
aVSome visitors came, using various behavioral change tricks
p262
aVlike putting out a plate of food and a plate of shit
p263
aVand watching the flies go one to the other.
p264
aVSomehow, people who'd been thinking
p265
aVthat what they were doing was not disgusting at all
p266
aVsuddenly thought, "Oops."
p267
aVNot only that, but they were ingesting their neighbors' shit.
p268
aVThat's what really made them change their behavior.
p269
aVSo this woman, this boy's mother
p270
aVinstalled this latrine in a few hours.
p271
aVHer entire life, she'd been using the banana field behind,
p272
aVbut she installed the latrine in a few hours.
p273
aVIt cost nothing. It's going to save that boy's life.
p274
aa(lp275
VSo when I get despondent about the state of sanitation,
p276
aVeven though these are pretty exciting times
p277
aVbecause we've got the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
p278
aVreinventing the toilet, which is great,
p279
aVwe've got Matt Damon going on bathroom strike,
p280
aVwhich is great for humanity, very bad for his colon.
p281
aVBut there are things to worry about.
p282
aVIt's the most off-track Millennium Development Goal.
p283
aVIt's about 50 or so years off track.
p284
aVWe're not going to meet targets,
p285
aVproviding people with sanitation at this rate.
p286
aVSo when I get sad about sanitation,
p287
aVI think of Japan, because Japan 70 years ago
p288
aVwas a nation of people who used pit latrines
p289
aVand wiped with sticks,
p290
aVand now it's a nation of what are called Woshurettos,
p291
aVwashlet toilets.
p292
aVThey have in-built bidet nozzles for a lovely,
p293
aVhands-free cleaning experience,
p294
aVand they have various other features
p295
aVlike a heated seat and an automatic lid-raising device
p296
aVwhich is known as the "marriage-saver."
p297
aV(Laughter)
p298
aa(lp299
VBut most importantly, what they have done in Japan,
p300
aVwhich I find so inspirational,
p301
aVis they've brought the toilet out from behind the locked door.
p302
aVThey've made it conversational.
p303
aVPeople go out and upgrade their toilet.
p304
aVThey talk about it. They've sanitized it.
p305
aVI hope that we can do that. It's not a difficult thing to do.
p306
aVAll we really need to do
p307
aVis look at this issue
p308
aVas the urgent, shameful issue that it is.
p309
aVAnd don't think that it's just in the poor world that things are wrong.
p310
aVOur sewers are crumbling.
p311
aVThings are going wrong here too.
p312
aVThe solution to all of this is pretty easy.
p313
aVI'm going to make your lives easy this afternoon
p314
aVand just ask you to do one thing,
p315
aVand that's to go out, protest,
p316
aVspeak about the unspeakable,
p317
aVand talk shit.
p318
aa(lp319
VThank you.

VSo let me ask for a show of hands.
p5
aVHow many people here are over the age of 48?
p6
aVWell, there do seem to be a few.
p7
aa(lp8
VWell, congratulations,
p9
aVbecause if you look at this particular slide of U.S. life expectancy,
p10
aVyou are now in excess of the average life span
p11
aVof somebody who was born in 1900.
p12
aa(lp13
VBut look what happened in the course of that century.
p14
aVIf you follow that curve,
p15
aVyou'll see that it starts way down there.
p16
aVThere's that dip there for the 1918 flu.
p17
aVAnd here we are at 2010,
p18
aVaverage life expectancy of a child born today, age 79,
p19
aVand we are not done yet.
p20
aVNow, that's the good news.
p21
aVBut there's still a lot of work to do.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo, for instance, if you ask,
p24
aVhow many diseases do we now know
p25
aVthe exact molecular basis?
p26
aVTurns out it's about 4,000, which is pretty amazing,
p27
aVbecause most of those molecular discoveries
p28
aVhave just happened in the last little while.
p29
aVIt's exciting to see that in terms of what we've learned,
p30
aVbut how many of those 4,000 diseases
p31
aVnow have treatments available?
p32
aVOnly about 250.
p33
aVSo we have this huge challenge, this huge gap.
p34
aa(lp35
VYou would think this wouldn't be too hard,
p36
aVthat we would simply have the ability
p37
aVto take this fundamental information that we're learning
p38
aVabout how it is that basic biology teaches us
p39
aVabout the causes of disease
p40
aVand build a bridge across this yawning gap
p41
aVbetween what we've learned about basic science
p42
aVand its application,
p43
aVa bridge that would look maybe something like this,
p44
aVwhere you'd have to put together a nice shiny way
p45
aVto get from one side to the other.
p46
aa(lp47
VWell, wouldn't it be nice if it was that easy?
p48
aVUnfortunately, it's not.
p49
aVIn reality, trying to go from fundamental knowledge
p50
aVto its application is more like this.
p51
aVThere are no shiny bridges.
p52
aVYou sort of place your bets.
p53
aVMaybe you've got a swimmer and a rowboat
p54
aVand a sailboat and a tugboat
p55
aVand you set them off on their way,
p56
aVand the rains come and the lightning flashes,
p57
aVand oh my gosh, there are sharks in the water
p58
aVand the swimmer gets into trouble,
p59
aVand, uh oh, the swimmer drowned
p60
aVand the sailboat capsized,
p61
aVand that tugboat, well, it hit the rocks,
p62
aVand maybe if you're lucky, somebody gets across.
p63
aa(lp64
VWell, what does this really look like?
p65
aVWell, what is it to make a therapeutic, anyway?
p66
aVWhat's a drug? A drug is made up
p67
aVof a small molecule of hydrogen, carbon,
p68
aVoxygen, nitrogen, and a few other atoms
p69
aVall cobbled together in a shape,
p70
aVand it's those shapes that determine whether, in fact,
p71
aVthat particular drug is going to hit its target.
p72
aVIs it going to land where it's supposed to?
p73
aVSo look at this picture here \u2014 a lot of shapes dancing around for you.
p74
aVNow what you need to do, if you're trying to develop
p75
aVa new treatment for autism
p76
aVor Alzheimer's disease or cancer
p77
aVis to find the right shape in that mix
p78
aVthat will ultimately provide benefit and will be safe.
p79
aVAnd when you look at what happens to that pipeline,
p80
aVyou start out maybe with thousands,
p81
aVtens of thousands of compounds.
p82
aVYou weed down through various steps
p83
aVthat cause many of these to fail.
p84
aVUltimately, maybe you can run a clinical trial with four or five of these,
p85
aVand if all goes well, 14 years after you started,
p86
aVyou will get one approval.
p87
aVAnd it will cost you upwards of a billion dollars
p88
aVfor that one success.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo we have to look at this pipeline the way an engineer would,
p91
aVand say, "How can we do better?"
p92
aVAnd that's the main theme of what I want to say to you this morning.
p93
aVHow can we make this go faster?
p94
aVHow can we make it more successful?
p95
aa(lp96
VWell, let me tell you about a few examples
p97
aVwhere this has actually worked.
p98
aVOne that has just happened in the last few months
p99
aVis the successful approval of a drug for cystic fibrosis.
p100
aVBut it's taken a long time to get there.
p101
aVCystic fibrosis had its molecular cause discovered in 1989
p102
aVby my group working with another group in Toronto,
p103
aVdiscovering what the mutation was in a particular gene
p104
aVon chromosome 7.
p105
aVThat picture you see there?
p106
aVHere it is. That's the same kid.
p107
aVThat's Danny Bessette, 23 years later,
p108
aVbecause this is the year,
p109
aVand it's also the year where Danny got married,
p110
aVwhere we have, for the first time, the approval by the FDA
p111
aVof a drug that precisely targets the defect in cystic fibrosis
p112
aVbased upon all this molecular understanding.
p113
aVThat's the good news.
p114
aVThe bad news is, this drug doesn't actually treat all cases of cystic fibrosis,
p115
aVand it won't work for Danny, and we're still waiting
p116
aVfor that next generation to help him.
p117
aa(lp118
VBut it took 23 years to get this far. That's too long.
p119
aVHow do we go faster?
p120
aa(lp121
VWell, one way to go faster is to take advantage of technology,
p122
aVand a very important technology that we depend on
p123
aVfor all of this is the human genome,
p124
aVthe ability to be able to look at a chromosome,
p125
aVto unzip it, to pull out all the DNA,
p126
aVand to be able to then read out the letters in that DNA code,
p127
aVthe A's, C's, G's and T's
p128
aVthat are our instruction book and the instruction book for all living things,
p129
aVand the cost of doing this,
p130
aVwhich used to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars,
p131
aVhas in the course of the last 10 years
p132
aVfallen faster than Moore's Law, down to the point
p133
aVwhere it is less than 10,000 dollars today to have your genome sequenced, or mine,
p134
aVand we're headed for the $1,000 genome fairly soon.
p135
aVWell, that's exciting.
p136
aVHow does that play out in terms of application to a disease?
p137
aa(lp138
VI want to tell you about another disorder.
p139
aVThis one is a disorder which is quite rare.
p140
aVIt's called Hutchinson-Gilford progeria,
p141
aVand it is the most dramatic form of premature aging.
p142
aVOnly about one in every four million kids has this disease,
p143
aVand in a simple way, what happens is,
p144
aVbecause of a mutation in a particular gene,
p145
aVa protein is made that's toxic to the cell
p146
aVand it causes these individuals to age
p147
aVat about seven times the normal rate.
p148
aa(lp149
VLet me show you a video of what that does to the cell.
p150
aVThe normal cell, if you looked at it under the microscope,
p151
aVwould have a nucleus sitting in the middle of the cell,
p152
aVwhich is nice and round and smooth in its boundaries
p153
aVand it looks kind of like that.
p154
aVA progeria cell, on the other hand,
p155
aVbecause of this toxic protein called progerin,
p156
aVhas these lumps and bumps in it.
p157
aVSo what we would like to do after discovering this
p158
aVback in 2003
p159
aVis to come up with a way to try to correct that.
p160
aVWell again, by knowing something about the molecular pathways,
p161
aVit was possible to pick
p162
aVone of those many, many compounds that might have been useful
p163
aVand try it out.
p164
aVIn an experiment done in cell culture
p165
aVand shown here in a cartoon,
p166
aVif you take that particular compound
p167
aVand you add it to that cell that has progeria,
p168
aVand you watch to see what happened,
p169
aVin just 72 hours, that cell becomes,
p170
aVfor all purposes that we can determine,
p171
aValmost like a normal cell.
p172
aa(lp173
VWell that was exciting, but would it actually work in a real human being?
p174
aVThis has led, in the space of only four years
p175
aVfrom the time the gene was discovered to the start of a clinical trial,
p176
aVto a test of that very compound.
p177
aVAnd the kids that you see here
p178
aVall volunteered to be part of this,
p179
aV28 of them,
p180
aVand you can see as soon as the picture comes up
p181
aVthat they are in fact a remarkable group of young people
p182
aVall afflicted by this disease,
p183
aVall looking quite similar to each other.
p184
aVAnd instead of telling you more about it,
p185
aVI'm going to invite one of them, Sam Berns from Boston,
p186
aVwho's here this morning, to come up on the stage
p187
aVand tell us about his experience
p188
aVas a child affected with progeria.
p189
aVSam is 15 years old. His parents, Scott Berns and Leslie Gordon,
p190
aVboth physicians, are here with us this morning as well.
p191
aVSam, please have a seat.
p192
aa(lp193
V(Applause)
p194
aa(lp195
VSo Sam, why don't you tell these folks
p196
aVwhat it's like being affected with this condition called progeria?
p197
aa(lp198
VSam Burns: Well, progeria limits me in some ways.
p199
aVI cannot play sports or do physical activities,
p200
aVbut I have been able to take interest in things
p201
aVthat progeria, luckily, does not limit.
p202
aVBut when there is something that I really do want to do
p203
aVthat progeria gets in the way of, like marching band
p204
aVor umpiring, we always find a way to do it,
p205
aVand that just shows that progeria isn't in control of my life.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Applause)
p208
aa(lp209
VFrancis Collins: So what would you like to say to researchers
p210
aVhere in the auditorium and others listening to this?
p211
aVWhat would you say to them both about research on progeria
p212
aVand maybe about other conditions as well?
p213
aa(lp214
VSB: Well, research on progeria has come so far
p215
aVin less than 15 years,
p216
aVand that just shows the drive that researchers can have
p217
aVto get this far, and it really means a lot
p218
aVto myself and other kids with progeria,
p219
aVand it shows that if that drive exists,
p220
aVanybody can cure any disease,
p221
aVand hopefully progeria can be cured in the near future,
p222
aVand so we can eliminate those 4,000 diseases
p223
aVthat Francis was talking about.
p224
aa(lp225
VFC: Excellent. So Sam took the day off from school today
p226
aVto be here, and he is \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p227
aVHe is, by the way, a straight-A+ student in the ninth grade
p228
aVin his school in Boston.
p229
aVPlease join me in thanking and welcoming Sam.
p230
aVSB: Thank you very much. FC: Well done. Well done, buddy.
p231
aV(Applause)
p232
aa(lp233
VSo I just want to say a couple more things
p234
aVabout that particular story, and then try to generalize
p235
aVhow could we have stories of success
p236
aVall over the place for these diseases, as Sam says,
p237
aVthese 4,000 that are waiting for answers.
p238
aVYou might have noticed that the drug
p239
aVthat is now in clinical trial for progeria
p240
aVis not a drug that was designed for that.
p241
aVIt's such a rare disease, it would be hard for a company
p242
aVto justify spending hundreds of millions of dollars to generate a drug.
p243
aVThis is a drug that was developed for cancer.
p244
aVTurned out, it didn't work very well for cancer,
p245
aVbut it has exactly the right properties, the right shape,
p246
aVto work for progeria, and that's what's happened.
p247
aVWouldn't it be great if we could do that more systematically?
p248
aVCould we, in fact, encourage all the companies that are out there
p249
aVthat have drugs in their freezers
p250
aVthat are known to be safe in humans
p251
aVbut have never actually succeeded in terms
p252
aVof being effective for the treatments they were tried for?
p253
aVNow we're learning about all these new molecular pathways \u2014
p254
aVsome of those could be repositioned or repurposed,
p255
aVor whatever word you want to use, for new applications,
p256
aVbasically teaching old drugs new tricks.
p257
aVThat could be a phenomenal, valuable activity.
p258
aVWe have many discussions now between NIH and companies
p259
aVabout doing this that are looking very promising.
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd you could expect quite a lot to come from this.
p262
aVThere are quite a number of success stories one can point to
p263
aVabout how this has led to major advances.
p264
aVThe first drug for HIV/AIDS
p265
aVwas not developed for HIV/AIDS.
p266
aVIt was developed for cancer. It was AZT.
p267
aVIt didn't work very well for cancer, but became
p268
aVthe first successful antiretroviral,
p269
aVand you can see from the table there are others as well.
p270
aa(lp271
VSo how do we actually make that a more generalizable effort?
p272
aVWell, we have to come up with a partnership
p273
aVbetween academia, government, the private sector,
p274
aVand patient organizations to make that so.
p275
aVAt NIH, we have started this new
p276
aVNational Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.
p277
aVIt just started last December, and this is one of its goals.
p278
aa(lp279
VLet me tell you another thing we could do.
p280
aVWouldn't it be nice to be able to a test a drug
p281
aVto see if it's effective and safe
p282
aVwithout having to put patients at risk,
p283
aVbecause that first time you're never quite sure?
p284
aVHow do we know, for instance, whether drugs are safe
p285
aVbefore we give them to people? We test them on animals.
p286
aVAnd it's not all that reliable, and it's costly,
p287
aVand it's time-consuming.
p288
aVSuppose we could do this instead on human cells.
p289
aVYou probably know, if you've been paying attention
p290
aVto some of the science literature
p291
aVthat you can now take a skin cell
p292
aVand encourage it to become a liver cell
p293
aVor a heart cell or a kidney cell or a brain cell for any of us.
p294
aVSo what if you used those cells as your test
p295
aVfor whether a drug is going to work and whether it's going to be safe?
p296
aa(lp297
VHere you see a picture of a lung on a chip.
p298
aVThis is something created by the Wyss Institute in Boston,
p299
aVand what they have done here, if we can run the little video,
p300
aVis to take cells from an individual,
p301
aVturn them into the kinds of cells that are present in the lung,
p302
aVand determine what would happen
p303
aVif you added to this various drug compounds
p304
aVto see if they are toxic or safe.
p305
aVYou can see this chip even breathes.
p306
aVIt has an air channel. It has a blood channel.
p307
aVAnd it has cells in between
p308
aVthat allow you to see what happens when you add a compound.
p309
aVAre those cells happy or not?
p310
aVYou can do this same kind of chip technology
p311
aVfor kidneys, for hearts, for muscles,
p312
aVall the places where you want to see whether a drug
p313
aVis going to be a problem, for the liver.
p314
aa(lp315
VAnd ultimately, because you can do this for the individual,
p316
aVwe could even see this moving to the point
p317
aVwhere the ability to develop and test medicines
p318
aVwill be you on a chip, what we're trying to say here is
p319
aVthe individualizing of the process of developing drugs
p320
aVand testing their safety.
p321
aa(lp322
VSo let me sum up.
p323
aVWe are in a remarkable moment here.
p324
aVFor me, at NIH now for almost 20 years,
p325
aVthere has never been a time where there was more excitement
p326
aVabout the potential that lies in front of us.
p327
aVWe have made all these discoveries
p328
aVpouring out of laboratories across the world.
p329
aVWhat do we need to capitalize on this? First of all, we need resources.
p330
aVThis is research that's high-risk, sometimes high-cost.
p331
aVThe payoff is enormous, both in terms of health
p332
aVand in terms of economic growth. We need to support that.
p333
aVSecond, we need new kinds of partnerships
p334
aVbetween academia and government and the private sector
p335
aVand patient organizations, just like the one I've been describing here,
p336
aVin terms of the way in which we could go after repurposing new compounds.
p337
aVAnd third, and maybe most important, we need talent.
p338
aVWe need the best and the brightest
p339
aVfrom many different disciplines to come and join this effort \u2014
p340
aVall ages, all different groups \u2014
p341
aVbecause this is the time, folks.
p342
aVThis is the 21st-century biology that you've been waiting for,
p343
aVand we have the chance to take that
p344
aVand turn it into something which will, in fact,
p345
aVknock out disease. That's my goal.
p346
aVI hope that's your goal.
p347
aVI think it'll be the goal of the poets and the muppets
p348
aVand the surfers and the bankers
p349
aVand all the other people who join this stage
p350
aVand think about what we're trying to do here
p351
aVand why it matters.
p352
aVIt matters for now. It matters as soon as possible.
p353
aVIf you don't believe me, just ask Sam.
p354
aa(lp355
VThank you all very much.

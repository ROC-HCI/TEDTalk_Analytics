VRecently I visited Beloit, Wisconsin.
p5
aVAnd I was there to honor a great 20th century explorer,
p6
aVRoy Chapman Andrews.
p7
aVDuring his time at the American Museum of Natural History,
p8
aVAndrews led a range of expeditions to uncharted regions,
p9
aVlike here in the Gobi Desert.
p10
aVHe was quite a figure.
p11
aVHe was later, it's said, the basis of the Indiana Jones character.
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd when I was in Beloit, Wisconsin,
p14
aVI gave a public lecture to a group of middle school students.
p15
aVAnd I'm here to tell you,
p16
aVif there's anything more intimidating than talking here at TED,
p17
aVit'll be trying to hold the attention
p18
aVof a group of a thousand 12-year-olds for a 45-minute lecture.
p19
aVDon't try that one.
p20
aa(lp21
VAt the end of the lecture they asked a number of questions,
p22
aVbut there was one that's really stuck with me since then.
p23
aVThere was a young girl who stood up,
p24
aVand she asked the question:
p25
aV"Where should we explore?"
p26
aa(lp27
VI think there's a sense that many of us have
p28
aVthat the great age of exploration on Earth is over,
p29
aVthat for the next generation
p30
aVthey're going to have to go to outer space or the deepest oceans
p31
aVin order to find something significant to explore.
p32
aVBut is that really the case?
p33
aVIs there really nowhere significant for us to explore
p34
aVleft here on Earth?
p35
aa(lp36
VIt sort of made me think back
p37
aVto one of my favorite explorers in the history of biology.
p38
aVThis is an explorer of the unseen world, Martinus Beijerinck.
p39
aVSo Beijerinck set out to discover the cause
p40
aVof tobacco mosaic disease.
p41
aVWhat he did is he took the infected juice from tobacco plants
p42
aVand he would filter it through smaller and smaller filters.
p43
aVAnd he reached the point
p44
aVwhere he felt that there must be something out there
p45
aVthat was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known \u2014
p46
aVbacteria, at the time.
p47
aVHe came up with a name for his mystery agent.
p48
aVHe called it the virus \u2014
p49
aVLatin for "poison."
p50
aVAnd in uncovering viruses,
p51
aVBeijerinck really opened this entirely new world for us.
p52
aa(lp53
VWe now know that viruses make up the majority
p54
aVof the genetic information on our planet,
p55
aVmore than the genetic information
p56
aVof all other forms of life combined.
p57
aVAnd obviously there's been tremendous practical applications
p58
aVassociated with this world \u2014
p59
aVthings like the eradication of smallpox,
p60
aVthe advent of a vaccine against cervical cancer,
p61
aVwhich we now know is mostly caused by human papillomavirus.
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd Beijerinck's discovery,
p64
aVthis was not something that occurred 500 years ago.
p65
aVIt was a little over 100 years ago
p66
aVthat Beijerinck discovered viruses.
p67
aVSo basically we had automobiles,
p68
aVbut we were unaware of the forms of life
p69
aVthat make up most of the genetic information on our planet.
p70
aa(lp71
VWe now have these amazing tools
p72
aVto allow us to explore the unseen world \u2014
p73
aVthings like deep sequencing,
p74
aVwhich allow us to do much more than just skim the surface
p75
aVand look at individual genomes from a particular species,
p76
aVbut to look at entire metagenomes,
p77
aVthe communities of teeming microorganisms in, on and around us
p78
aVand to document all of the genetic information in these species.
p79
aVWe can apply these techniques
p80
aVto things from soil to skin and everything in between.
p81
aa(lp82
VIn my organization we now do this on a regular basis
p83
aVto identify the causes of outbreaks
p84
aVthat are unclear exactly what causes them.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd just to give you a sense of how this works,
p87
aVimagine that we took a nasal swab from every single one of you.
p88
aVAnd this is something we commonly do
p89
aVto look for respiratory viruses like influenza.
p90
aVThe first thing we would see
p91
aVis a tremendous amount of genetic information.
p92
aVAnd if we started looking into that genetic information,
p93
aVwe'd see a number of usual suspects out there \u2014
p94
aVof course, a lot of human genetic information,
p95
aVbut also bacterial and viral information,
p96
aVmostly from things that are completely harmless within your nose.
p97
aVBut we'd also see something very, very surprising.
p98
aVAs we started to look at this information,
p99
aVwe would see that about 20 percent of the genetic information in your nose
p100
aVdoesn't match anything that we've ever seen before \u2014
p101
aVno plant, animal, fungus, virus or bacteria.
p102
aVBasically we have no clue what this is.
p103
aa(lp104
VAnd for the small group of us who actually study this kind of data,
p105
aVa few of us have actually begun to call this information
p106
aVbiological dark matter.
p107
aVWe know it's not anything that we've seen before;
p108
aVit's sort of the equivalent of an uncharted continent
p109
aVright within our own genetic information.
p110
aVAnd there's a lot of it.
p111
aVIf you think 20 percent of genetic information in your nose is a lot
p112
aVof biological dark matter,
p113
aVif we looked at your gut,
p114
aVup to 40 or 50 percent of that information is biological dark matter.
p115
aVAnd even in the relatively sterile blood,
p116
aVaround one to two percent of this information is dark matter \u2014
p117
aVcan't be classified, can't be typed or matched with anything we've seen before.
p118
aa(lp119
VAt first we thought that perhaps this was artifact.
p120
aVThese deep sequencing tools are relatively new.
p121
aVBut as they become more and more accurate,
p122
aVwe've determined that this information is a form of life,
p123
aVor at least some of it is a form of life.
p124
aVAnd while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter
p125
aVare really only in their infancy,
p126
aVthere's a very, very exciting possibility that exists:
p127
aVthat buried in this life, in this genetic information,
p128
aVare signatures of as of yet unidentified life.
p129
aVThat as we explore these strings of A's, T's, C's and G's,
p130
aVwe may uncover a completely new class of life
p131
aVthat, like Beijerinck, will fundamentally change
p132
aVthe way that we think about the nature of biology.
p133
aVThat perhaps will allow us to identify the cause of a cancer that afflicts us
p134
aVor identify the source of an outbreak that we aren't familiar with
p135
aVor perhaps create a new tool in molecular biology.
p136
aa(lp137
VI'm pleased to announce that,
p138
aValong with colleagues at Stanford and Caltech and UCSF,
p139
aVwe're currently starting an initiative
p140
aVto explore biological dark matter for the existence of new forms of life.
p141
aa(lp142
VA little over a hundred years ago,
p143
aVpeople were unaware of viruses,
p144
aVthe forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet.
p145
aVA hundred years from now, people may marvel
p146
aVthat we were perhaps completely unaware of a new class of life
p147
aVthat literally was right under our noses.
p148
aa(lp149
VIt's true, we may have charted all the continents on the planet
p150
aVand we may have discovered all the mammals that are out there,
p151
aVbut that doesn't mean that there's nothing left to explore on Earth.
p152
aVBeijerinck and his kind
p153
aVprovide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers \u2014
p154
aVpeople like that young girl from Beloit, Wisconsin.
p155
aVAnd I think if we phrase that lesson, it's something like this:
p156
aVDon't assume that what we currently think is out there is the full story.
p157
aVGo after the dark matter in whatever field you choose to explore.
p158
aVThere are unknowns all around us
p159
aVand they're just waiting to be discovered.
p160
aa(lp161
VThank you.

VWhen I was first learning to meditate,
p5
aVthe instruction was to simply pay attention to my breath,
p6
aVand when my mind wandered, to bring it back.
p7
aa(lp8
VSounded simple enough.
p9
aVYet I'd sit on these silent retreats,
p10
aVsweating through T-shirts in the middle of winter.
p11
aVI'd take naps every chance I got because it was really hard work.
p12
aVActually, it was exhausting.
p13
aVThe instruction was simple enough
p14
aVbut I was missing something really important.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo why is it so hard to pay attention?
p17
aVWell, studies show
p18
aVthat even when we're really trying to pay attention to something \u2014
p19
aVlike maybe this talk \u2014
p20
aVat some point,
p21
aVabout half of us will drift off into a daydream,
p22
aVor have this urge to check our Twitter feed.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo what's going on here?
p25
aVIt turns out that we're fighting one of the most evolutionarily-conserved
p26
aVlearning processes currently known in science,
p27
aVone that's conserved
p28
aVback to the most basic nervous systems known to man.
p29
aa(lp30
VThis reward-based learning process
p31
aVis called positive and negative reinforcement,
p32
aVand basically goes like this.
p33
aVWe see some food that looks good,
p34
aVour brain says, "Calories! ... Survival!"
p35
aVWe eat the food, we taste it \u2014
p36
aVit tastes good.
p37
aVAnd especially with sugar,
p38
aVour bodies send a signal to our brain that says,
p39
aV"Remember what you're eating and where you found it."
p40
aVWe lay down this context-dependent memory
p41
aVand learn to repeat the process next time.
p42
aVSee food,
p43
aVeat food, feel good,
p44
aVrepeat.
p45
aVTrigger, behavior, reward.
p46
aa(lp47
VSimple, right?
p48
aVWell, after a while, our creative brains say,
p49
aV"You know what?
p50
aVYou can use this for more than just remembering where food is.
p51
aVYou know, next time you feel bad,
p52
aVwhy don't you try eating something good so you'll feel better?"
p53
aVWe thank our brains for the great idea,
p54
aVtry this and quickly learn
p55
aVthat if we eat chocolate or ice cream when we're mad or sad,
p56
aVwe feel better.
p57
aa(lp58
VSame process,
p59
aVjust a different trigger.
p60
aVInstead of this hunger signal coming from our stomach,
p61
aVthis emotional signal \u2014 feeling sad \u2014
p62
aVtriggers that urge to eat.
p63
aa(lp64
VMaybe in our teenage years,
p65
aVwe were a nerd at school,
p66
aVand we see those rebel kids outside smoking and we think,
p67
aV"Hey, I want to be cool."
p68
aVSo we start smoking.
p69
aVThe Marlboro Man wasn't a dork, and that was no accident.
p70
aVSee cool,
p71
aVsmoke to be cool,
p72
aVfeel good. Repeat.
p73
aVTrigger, behavior, reward.
p74
aVAnd each time we do this,
p75
aVwe learn to repeat the process
p76
aVand it becomes a habit.
p77
aVSo later,
p78
aVfeeling stressed out triggers that urge to smoke a cigarette
p79
aVor to eat something sweet.
p80
aa(lp81
VNow, with these same brain processes,
p82
aVwe've gone from learning to survive
p83
aVto literally killing ourselves with these habits.
p84
aVObesity and smoking
p85
aVare among the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the world.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo back to my breath.
p88
aVWhat if instead of fighting our brains,
p89
aVor trying to force ourselves to pay attention,
p90
aVwe instead tapped into this natural, reward-based learning process ...
p91
aVbut added a twist?
p92
aVWhat if instead we just got really curious
p93
aVabout what was happening in our momentary experience?
p94
aa(lp95
VI'll give you an example.
p96
aVIn my lab,
p97
aVwe studied whether mindfulness training could help people quit smoking.
p98
aVNow, just like trying to force myself to pay attention to my breath,
p99
aVthey could try to force themselves to quit smoking.
p100
aVAnd the majority of them had tried this before and failed \u2014
p101
aVon average, six times.
p102
aa(lp103
VNow, with mindfulness training,
p104
aVwe dropped the bit about forcing and instead focused on being curious.
p105
aVIn fact, we even told them to smoke.
p106
aVWhat? Yeah, we said, "Go ahead and smoke,
p107
aVjust be really curious about what it's like when you do."
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd what did they notice?
p110
aVWell here's an example from one of our smokers.
p111
aVShe said, "Mindful smoking:
p112
aVsmells like stinky cheese
p113
aVand tastes like chemicals,
p114
aVYUCK!"
p115
aVNow, she knew, cognitively that smoking was bad for her,
p116
aVthat's why she joined our program.
p117
aVWhat she discovered just by being curiously aware when she smoked
p118
aVwas that smoking tastes like shit.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VNow, she moved from knowledge to wisdom.
p123
aVShe moved from knowing in her head that smoking was bad for her
p124
aVto knowing it in her bones,
p125
aVand the spell of smoking was broken.
p126
aVShe started to become disenchanted with her behavior.
p127
aa(lp128
VNow, the prefrontal cortex,
p129
aVthat youngest part of our brain from an evolutionary perspective,
p130
aVit understands on an intellectual level that we shouldn't smoke.
p131
aVAnd it tries its hardest to help us change our behavior,
p132
aVto help us stop smoking,
p133
aVto help us stop eating that second, that third, that fourth cookie.
p134
aVWe call this cognitive control.
p135
aVWe're using cognition to control our behavior.
p136
aVUnfortunately,
p137
aVthis is also the first part of our brain
p138
aVthat goes offline when we get stressed out,
p139
aVwhich isn't that helpful.
p140
aa(lp141
VNow, we can all relate to this in our own experience.
p142
aVWe're much more likely to do things like yell at our spouse or kids
p143
aVwhen we're stressed out or tired,
p144
aVeven though we know it's not going to be helpful.
p145
aVWe just can't help ourselves.
p146
aa(lp147
VWhen the prefrontal cortex goes offline,
p148
aVwe fall back into our old habits,
p149
aVwhich is why this disenchantment is so important.
p150
aVSeeing what we get from our habits
p151
aVhelps us understand them at a deeper level \u2014
p152
aVto know it in our bones
p153
aVso we don't have to force ourselves to hold back
p154
aVor restrain ourselves from behavior.
p155
aVWe're just less interested in doing it in the first place.
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd this is what mindfulness is all about:
p158
aVSeeing really clearly what we get when we get caught up in our behaviors,
p159
aVbecoming disenchanted on a visceral level
p160
aVand from this disenchanted stance, naturally letting go.
p161
aa(lp162
VThis isn't to say that, poof, magically we quit smoking.
p163
aVBut over time, as we learn to see more and more clearly
p164
aVthe results of our actions,
p165
aVwe let go of old habits and form new ones.
p166
aa(lp167
VThe paradox here
p168
aVis that mindfulness is just about being really interested
p169
aVin getting close and personal
p170
aVwith what's actually happening in our bodies and minds
p171
aVfrom moment to moment.
p172
aVThis willingness to turn toward our experience
p173
aVrather than trying to make unpleasant cravings go away as quickly as possible.
p174
aVAnd this willingness to turn toward our experience
p175
aVis supported by curiosity,
p176
aVwhich is naturally rewarding.
p177
aa(lp178
VWhat does curiosity feel like?
p179
aVIt feels good.
p180
aVAnd what happens when we get curious?
p181
aVWe start to notice that cravings are simply made up of body sensations \u2014
p182
aVoh, there's tightness, there's tension,
p183
aVthere's restlessness \u2014
p184
aVand that these body sensations come and go.
p185
aVThese are bite-size pieces of experiences
p186
aVthat we can manage from moment to moment
p187
aVrather than getting clobbered by this huge, scary craving
p188
aVthat we choke on.
p189
aa(lp190
VIn other words, when we get curious,
p191
aVwe step out of our old, fear-based, reactive habit patterns,
p192
aVand we step into being.
p193
aVWe become this inner scientist
p194
aVwhere we're eagerly awaiting that next data point.
p195
aa(lp196
VNow, this might sound too simplistic to affect behavior.
p197
aVBut in one study, we found that mindfulness training
p198
aVwas twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking.
p199
aVSo it actually works.
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd when we studied the brains of experienced meditators,
p202
aVwe found that parts of a neural network of self-referential processing
p203
aVcalled the default mode network
p204
aVwere at play.
p205
aVNow, one current hypothesis is that a region of this network,
p206
aVcalled the posterior cingulate cortex,
p207
aVis activated not necessarily by craving itself
p208
aVbut when we get caught up in it, when we get sucked in,
p209
aVand it takes us for a ride.
p210
aa(lp211
VIn contrast, when we let go \u2014
p212
aVstep out of the process
p213
aVjust by being curiously aware of what's happening \u2014
p214
aVthis same brain region quiets down.
p215
aa(lp216
VNow we're testing app and online-based mindfulness training programs
p217
aVthat target these core mechanisms
p218
aVand, ironically, use the same technology that's driving us to distraction
p219
aVto help us step out of our unhealthy habit patterns
p220
aVof smoking, of stress eating and other addictive behaviors.
p221
aa(lp222
VNow, remember that bit about context-dependent memory?
p223
aVWe can deliver these tools to peoples' fingertips
p224
aVin the contexts that matter most.
p225
aVSo we can help them
p226
aVtap into their inherent capacity to be curiously aware
p227
aVright when that urge to smoke or stress eat or whatever arises.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo if you don't smoke or stress eat,
p230
aVmaybe the next time you feel this urge to check your email when you're bored,
p231
aVor you're trying to distract yourself from work,
p232
aVor maybe to compulsively respond to that text message when you're driving,
p233
aVsee if you can tap into this natural capacity,
p234
aVjust be curiously aware
p235
aVof what's happening in your body and mind in that moment.
p236
aVIt will just be another chance
p237
aVto perpetuate one of our endless and exhaustive habit loops ...
p238
aVor step out of it.
p239
aa(lp240
VInstead of see text message, compulsively text back,
p241
aVfeel a little bit better \u2014
p242
aVnotice the urge,
p243
aVget curious,
p244
aVfeel the joy of letting go
p245
aVand repeat.
p246
aa(lp247
VThank you.

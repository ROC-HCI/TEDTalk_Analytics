VOn September 10, the morning of my seventh birthday,
p5
aVI came downstairs to the kitchen, where my mother was washing the dishes
p6
aVand my father was reading the paper or something,
p7
aVand I sort of presented myself to them in the doorway, and they said,
p8
aV"Hey, happy birthday!" And I said, "I'm seven."
p9
aVAnd my father smiled and said,
p10
aV"Well, you know what that means, don't you?"
p11
aVAnd I said, "Yeah, that I'm going to have a party
p12
aVand a cake and get a lot of presents?"
p13
aVAnd my dad said, "Well, yes.
p14
aVBut more importantly,
p15
aVbeing seven means that you've reached the age of reason,
p16
aVand you're now capable of committing any and all sins against God and man."
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VNow, I had heard this phrase, "age of reason," before.
p21
aVSister Mary Kevin had been bandying it about
p22
aVmy second-grade class at school.
p23
aVBut when she said it,
p24
aVthe phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations
p25
aVfor our first communion and our first confession,
p26
aVand everybody knew that was really all about the white dress
p27
aVand the white veil.
p28
aVAnd anyway, I hadn't really paid all that much attention
p29
aVto that phrase, "age of reason."
p30
aVSo, I said, "Yeah, yeah, age of reason. What does that mean again?"
p31
aVAnd my dad said, "Well, we believe, in the Catholic Church,
p32
aVthat God knows that little kids don't know the difference between right and wrong,
p33
aVbut when you're seven, you're old enough to know better.
p34
aVSo, you've grown up and reached the age of reason,
p35
aVand now God will start keeping notes on you,
p36
aVand begin your permanent record."
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd I said, "Oh ...
p41
aVWait a minute.
p42
aVYou mean all that time, up till today,
p43
aVall that time I was so good, God didn't notice it?"
p44
aVAnd my mom said, "Well, I noticed it."
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd I thought, "How could I not have known this before?
p49
aVHow could it not have sunk in when they'd been telling me?
p50
aVAll that being good and no real credit for it.
p51
aVAnd worst of all, how could I not have realized
p52
aVthis very important information
p53
aVuntil the very day that it was basically useless to me?"
p54
aVSo I said, "Well, Mom and Dad, what about Santa Claus?
p55
aVI mean, Santa Claus knows if you're naughty or nice, right?"
p56
aVAnd my dad said, "Yeah, but, honey,
p57
aVI think that's technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas."
p58
aVAnd my mother said, "Oh, Bob, stop it. Let's just tell her. I mean, she's seven.
p59
aVJulie, there is no Santa Claus."
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
VNow, this was actually not that upsetting to me.
p64
aVMy parents had this whole elaborate story about Santa Claus:
p65
aVhow they had talked to Santa Claus himself and agreed
p66
aVthat instead of Santa delivering our presents
p67
aVover the night of Christmas Eve,
p68
aVlike he did for every other family who got to open their surprises
p69
aVfirst thing Christmas morning,
p70
aVour family would give Santa more time.
p71
aVSanta would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass
p72
aVon Christmas morning, but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss.
p73
aVWhich made me very suspicious.
p74
aVIt was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents.
p75
aVI mean, my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style,
p76
aVand my mother's handwriting was so close to Santa's.
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
VPlus, why would Santa save time by having to loop back
p81
aVto our house after he'd gone to everybody else's?
p82
aVThere was only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence:
p83
aVour family was too strange and weird for even Santa Claus to come visit,
p84
aVand my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment,
p85
aVthis humiliation of rejection by Santa, who was jolly \u2014
p86
aVbut let's face it, he was also very judgmental.
p87
aVSo to find out that there was no Santa Claus at all
p88
aVwas actually sort of a relief.
p89
aa(lp90
VI left the kitchen not really in shock about Santa,
p91
aVbut rather, I was just dumbfounded
p92
aVabout how I could have missed this whole age of reason thing.
p93
aVIt was too late for me, but maybe I could help someone else,
p94
aVsomeone who could use the information.
p95
aVThey had to fit two criteria:
p96
aVthey had to be old enough to be able to understand
p97
aVthe whole concept of the age of reason, and not yet seven.
p98
aVThe answer was clear: my brother Bill. He was six.
p99
aVWell, I finally found Bill
p100
aVabout a block away from our house at this public school playground.
p101
aVIt was a Saturday, and he was all by himself,
p102
aVjust kicking a ball against the side of a wall.
p103
aVI ran up to him and said, "Bill!
p104
aVI just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven,
p105
aVand then you're capable of committing any and all sins
p106
aVagainst God and man."
p107
aVAnd Bill said, "So?"
p108
aVAnd I said, "So, you're six.
p109
aVYou have a whole year to do anything you want to and God won't notice it."
p110
aVAnd he said, "So?"
p111
aVAnd I said, "So? So everything!"
p112
aVAnd I turned to run. I was so angry with him.
p113
aVBut when I got to the top of the steps,
p114
aVI turned around dramatically and said,
p115
aV"Oh, by the way, Bill \u2014 there is no Santa Claus."
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
VNow, I didn't know it at the time,
p120
aVbut I really wasn't turning seven on September 10th.
p121
aVFor my 13th birthday,
p122
aVI planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends,
p123
aVbut a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and said,
p124
aV"I need to speak to you privately.
p125
aVSeptember 10th is not your birthday. It's October 10th."
p126
aVAnd I said, "What?"
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd she said ...
p131
aa(lp132
V(Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
V"Listen. The cut-off date to start kindergarten was September 15th."
p135
aa(lp136
V(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
V"So I told them that your birthday was September 10th,
p139
aVand then I wasn't sure
p140
aVthat you weren't just going to go blab it all over the place,
p141
aVso I started to tell you your birthday was September 10th.
p142
aVBut, Julie, you were so ready to start school, honey. You were so ready."
p143
aVI thought about it, and when I was four,
p144
aVI was already the oldest of four children,
p145
aVand my mother even had another child to come,
p146
aVso what I think she \u2014 understandably \u2014 really meant
p147
aVwas that she was so ready, she was so ready.
p148
aVThen she said, "Don't worry, Julie.
p149
aVEvery year on October 10th,
p150
aVwhen it was your birthday but you didn't realize it,
p151
aVI made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day."
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VWhich was comforting, but troubling.
p156
aVMy mother had been celebrating my birthday with me, without me.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
VWhat was so upsetting about this new piece of information
p161
aVwas not that I had to change the date of my slumber party
p162
aVwith all of my girlfriends.
p163
aVWhat was most upsetting was that this meant I was not a Virgo.
p164
aVI had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom.
p165
aVAnd I read my horoscope every single day,
p166
aVand it was so totally me.
p167
aa(lp168
V(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd this meant that I was a Libra?
p171
aVSo, I took the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster.
p172
aVThe Virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair,
p173
aVsort of lounging by some water,
p174
aVbut the Libra poster is just a huge scale.
p175
aVThis was around the time that I started filling out physically,
p176
aVand I was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls,
p177
aVand frankly, the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale
p178
aVjust seemed ominous and depressing.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VBut I got the new Libra poster,
p183
aVand I started to read my new Libra horoscope,
p184
aVand I was astonished to find that it was also totally me.
p185
aa(lp186
V(Laughter)
p187
aa(lp188
VIt wasn't until years later, looking back
p189
aVon this whole age-of-reason, change-of-birthday thing,
p190
aVthat it dawned on me:
p191
aVI wasn't turning seven when I thought I turned seven.
p192
aVI had a whole other month
p193
aVto do anything I wanted to before God started keeping tabs on me.
p194
aVOh, life can be so cruel.
p195
aVOne day, two Mormon missionaries came to my door.
p196
aVNow, I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles,
p197
aVand my block is \u2014 well, it's a natural beginning
p198
aVfor people who are peddling things door to door.
p199
aVSometimes I get little old ladies from the Seventh Day Adventist Church
p200
aVshowing me these cartoon pictures of heaven.
p201
aVAnd sometimes I get teenagers who promise me
p202
aVthat they won't join a gang and just start robbing people,
p203
aVif I only buy some magazine subscriptions from them.
p204
aVSo normally, I just ignore the doorbell, but on this day, I answered.
p205
aVAnd there stood two boys, each about 19, in white, starched short-sleeved shirts,
p206
aVand they had little name tags
p207
aVthat identified them as official representatives
p208
aVof the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
p209
aVand they said they had a message for me, from God.
p210
aVI said, "A message for me? From God?" And they said, "Yes."
p211
aVNow, I was raised in the Pacific Northwest,
p212
aVaround a lot of Church of Latter-day Saints people and, you know,
p213
aVI've worked with them and even dated them,
p214
aVbut I never really knew the doctrine,
p215
aVor what they said to people when they were out on a mission,
p216
aVand I guess I was sort of curious, so I said, "Well, please, come in."
p217
aVAnd they looked really happy,
p218
aVbecause I don't think this happens to them all that often.
p219
aa(lp220
V(Laughter)
p221
aa(lp222
VAnd I sat them down, and I got them glasses of water \u2014
p223
aVOk, I got it, I got it.
p224
aVI got them glasses of water.
p225
aVDon't touch my hair, that's the thing.
p226
aa(lp227
V(Laughter)
p228
aa(lp229
VYou can't put a video of myself in front of me
p230
aVand expect me not to fix my hair.
p231
aVOk.
p232
aa(lp233
V(Laughter)
p234
aa(lp235
VSo I sat them down and I got them glasses of water,
p236
aVand after niceties, they said,
p237
aV"Do you believe that God loves you with all his heart?"
p238
aVAnd I thought, "Well, of course I believe in God,
p239
aVbut you know, I don't like that word 'heart,'
p240
aVbecause it anthropomorphizes God,
p241
aVand I don't like the word, 'his,' either, because that sexualizes God."
p242
aVBut I didn't want to argue semantics with these boys,
p243
aVso after a very long, uncomfortable pause, I said,
p244
aV"Yes, yes, I do. I feel very loved."
p245
aVAnd they looked at each other and smiled,
p246
aVlike that was the right answer.
p247
aVAnd then they said, "Do you believe
p248
aVthat we're all brothers and sisters on this planet?"
p249
aVAnd I said, "Yes, I do."
p250
aVAnd I was so relieved that it was a question I could answer so quickly.
p251
aVAnd they said, "Well, then we have a story to tell you."
p252
aa(lp253
VAnd they told me this story all about this guy named Lehi,
p254
aVwho lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC.
p255
aVNow, apparently in Jerusalem in 600 BC, everyone was completely bad and evil.
p256
aVEvery single one of them: man, woman, child, infant, fetus.
p257
aVAnd God came to Lehi and said to him,
p258
aV"Put your family on a boat and I will lead you out of here."
p259
aVAnd God did lead them.
p260
aVHe led them to America.
p261
aVI said, "America?
p262
aa(lp263
V(Laughter)
p264
aa(lp265
VFrom Jerusalem to America by boat in 600 BC?"
p266
aVAnd they said, "Yes."
p267
aa(lp268
V(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
VThen they told me how Lehi and his descendants
p271
aVreproduced and reproduced, and over the course of 600 years,
p272
aVthere were two great races of them, the Nephites and the Lamanites,
p273
aVand the Nephites were totally good \u2014 each and every one of them \u2014
p274
aVand the Lamanites were totally bad and evil \u2014
p275
aVevery single one of them just bad to the bone.
p276
aa(lp277
VThen, after Jesus died on the cross for our sins,
p278
aVon his way up to heaven,
p279
aVhe stopped by America and visited the Nephites.
p280
aa(lp281
V(Laughter)
p282
aa(lp283
VAnd he told them that if they all remained totally, totally good \u2014
p284
aVeach and every one of them \u2014
p285
aVthey would win the war against the evil Lamanites.
p286
aVBut apparently somebody blew it,
p287
aVbecause the Lamanites were able to kill all the Nephites.
p288
aVAll but one guy, this guy named Mormon,
p289
aVwho managed to survive by hiding in the woods.
p290
aVAnd he made sure this whole story was written down
p291
aVin reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates,
p292
aVwhich he then buried near Palmyra, New York.
p293
aa(lp294
V(Laughter)
p295
aa(lp296
VWell, I was just on the edge of my seat.
p297
aa(lp298
V(Laughter)
p299
aa(lp300
VI said, "What happened to the Lamanites?"
p301
aVAnd they said, "Well, they became our Native Americans, here in the U.S."
p302
aVAnd I said, "So, you believe the Native Americans are descended
p303
aVfrom a people who were totally evil?"
p304
aVAnd they said, "Yes."
p305
aVThen they told me how this guy named Joseph Smith
p306
aVfound those buried gold plates right in his backyard,
p307
aVand he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat
p308
aVand then buried his face into,
p309
aVand this allowed him to translate the gold plates
p310
aVfrom the reformed Egyptian into English.
p311
aa(lp312
VWell, at this point I just wanted to give these two boys some advice
p313
aVabout their pitch.
p314
aa(lp315
V(Laughter)
p316
aa(lp317
VI wanted to say \u2014
p318
aa(lp319
V(Applause)
p320
aa(lp321
V"Ok, don't start with this story."
p322
aa(lp323
V(Laughter)
p324
aa(lp325
VI mean, even the Scientologists
p326
aVknow to start with a personality test before they start \u2014
p327
aa(lp328
V(Applause)
p329
aa(lp330
Vtelling people all about Xenu, the evil intergalactic overlord.
p331
aVThen, they said, "Do you believe that God speaks to us
p332
aVthrough his righteous prophets?"
p333
aVAnd I said, "No, I don't,"
p334
aVbecause I was sort of upset about this Lamanite story
p335
aVand this crazy gold plate story,
p336
aVbut the truth was, I hadn't really thought this through,
p337
aVso I backpedaled a little and I said,
p338
aV"Well, what exactly do you mean by 'righteous'?
p339
aVAnd what do you mean by prophets? Like, could the prophets be women?"
p340
aVAnd they said, "No." And I said, "Why?"
p341
aVAnd they said, "Well, it's because God gave women a gift
p342
aVthat is so spectacular,
p343
aVit is so wonderful, that the only gift he had left over to give men
p344
aVwas the gift of prophecy."
p345
aVWhat is this wonderful gift God gave women, I wondered?
p346
aVMaybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt?
p347
aa(lp348
V(Laughter)
p349
aa(lp350
VWomen's longer lifespan?
p351
aVThe fact that women tend to be much less violent than men?
p352
aVBut no \u2014 it wasn't any of these gifts.
p353
aVThey said, "Well, it's her ability to bear children."
p354
aVI said, "Oh, come on.
p355
aVI mean, even if women tried to have a baby every single year
p356
aVfrom the time they were 15 to the time they were 45,
p357
aVassuming they didn't die from exhaustion,
p358
aVit still seems like some women would have some time left over
p359
aVto hear the word of God."
p360
aVAnd they said, "No."
p361
aa(lp362
V(Laughter)
p363
aa(lp364
VWell, then they didn't look so fresh-faced and cute to me any more,
p365
aVbut they had more to say.
p366
aVThey said, "Well, we also believe that if you're a Mormon,
p367
aVand if you're in good standing with the church,
p368
aVwhen you die, you get to go to heaven
p369
aVand be with your family for all eternity."
p370
aVAnd I said, "Oh, dear.
p371
aa(lp372
V(Laughter)
p373
aa(lp374
VThat wouldn't be such a good incentive for me."
p375
aa(lp376
V(Laughter)
p377
aa(lp378
VAnd they said, "Oh.
p379
aa(lp380
V(Laughter)
p381
aa(lp382
VHey! Well, we also believe that when you go to heaven,
p383
aVyou get your body restored to you in its best original state.
p384
aVLike, if you'd lost a leg, well, you get it back.
p385
aVOr, if you'd gone blind, you could see."
p386
aVI said, "Oh. Now, I don't have a uterus,
p387
aVbecause I had cancer a few years ago.
p388
aVSo does this mean that if I went to heaven,
p389
aVI would get my old uterus back?"
p390
aVAnd they said, "Sure."
p391
aVAnd I said, "I don't want it back. I'm happy without it." Gosh.
p392
aVWhat if you had a nose job and you liked it?
p393
aa(lp394
V(Laughter)
p395
aa(lp396
VWould God force you to get your old nose back?
p397
aVThen they gave me this Book of Mormon,
p398
aVtold me to read this chapter and that chapter,
p399
aVand said they'd come back and check in on me,
p400
aVand I think I said something like, "Please don't hurry,"
p401
aVor maybe just, "Please don't," and they were gone.
p402
aa(lp403
VOk, so I initially felt really superior to these boys,
p404
aVand smug in my more conventional faith.
p405
aVBut then the more I thought about it, the more I had to be honest with myself.
p406
aVIf someone came to my door
p407
aVand I was hearing Catholic theology and dogma for the very first time,
p408
aVand they said, "We believe that God impregnated a very young girl
p409
aVwithout the use of intercourse,
p410
aVand the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us."
p411
aa(lp412
V(Laughter)
p413
aa(lp414
V"And she had a baby, and that's the son of God,"
p415
aVI mean, I would think that's equally ridiculous.
p416
aVI'm just so used to that story.
p417
aa(lp418
V(Laughter)
p419
aa(lp420
VSo, I couldn't let myself feel condescending towards these boys.
p421
aVBut the question they asked me when they first arrived
p422
aVreally stuck in my head:
p423
aVDid I believe that God loved me with all his heart?
p424
aVBecause I wasn't exactly sure how I felt about that question.
p425
aVNow, if they had asked me,
p426
aV"Do you feel that God loves you with all his heart?"
p427
aVWell, that would have been much different, I think I would have instantly answered,
p428
aV"Yes, yes, I feel it all the time.
p429
aVI feel God's love when I'm hurt and confused,
p430
aVand I feel consoled and cared for.
p431
aVI take shelter in God's love when I don't understand why tragedy hits,
p432
aVand I feel God's love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see."
p433
aVBut since they asked me that question with the word "believe" in it,
p434
aVsomehow it was all different,
p435
aVbecause I wasn't exactly sure if I believed what I so clearly felt.

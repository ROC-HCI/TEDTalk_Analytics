VOne of the things I want to establish right from the start
p5
aVis that not all neurosurgeons wear cowboy boots.
p6
aVI just wanted you to know that.
p7
aa(lp8
VSo I am indeed a neurosurgeon,
p9
aVand I follow a long tradition of neurosurgery,
p10
aVand what I'm going to tell you about today
p11
aVis adjusting the dials in the circuits in the brain,
p12
aVbeing able to go anywhere in the brain
p13
aVand turning areas of the brain up or down
p14
aVto help our patients.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo as I said, neurosurgery comes from a long tradition.
p17
aVIt's been around for about 7,000 years.
p18
aVIn Mesoamerica, there used to be neurosurgery,
p19
aVand there were these neurosurgeons that used to treat patients.
p20
aVAnd they were trying to \u2014 they knew that the brain was involved
p21
aVin neurological and psychiatric disease.
p22
aVThey didn't know exactly what they were doing.
p23
aVNot much has changed, by the way. (Laughter)
p24
aVBut they thought that,
p25
aVif you had a neurologic or psychiatric disease,
p26
aVit must be because you are possessed
p27
aVby an evil spirit.
p28
aVSo if you are possessed by an evil spirit
p29
aVcausing neurologic or psychiatric problems,
p30
aVthen the way to treat this is, of course,
p31
aVto make a hole in your skull and let the evil spirit escape.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo this was the thinking back then,
p34
aVand these individuals made these holes.
p35
aVSometimes the patients were a little bit reluctant
p36
aVto go through this because, you can tell that
p37
aVthe holes are made partially and then, I think,
p38
aVthere was some trepanation, and then they left very quickly
p39
aVand it was only a partial hole,
p40
aVand we know they survived these procedures.
p41
aVBut this was common.
p42
aVThere were some sites where one percent
p43
aVof all the skulls have these holes, and so you can see
p44
aVthat neurologic and psychiatric disease is quite common,
p45
aVand it was also quite common about 7,000 years ago.
p46
aa(lp47
VNow, in the course of time,
p48
aVwe've come to realize that
p49
aVdifferent parts of the brain do different things.
p50
aVSo there are areas of the brain that are dedicated
p51
aVto controlling your movement or your vision
p52
aVor your memory or your appetite, and so on.
p53
aVAnd when things work well, then the nervous system
p54
aVworks well, and everything functions.
p55
aVBut once in a while, things don't go so well,
p56
aVand there's trouble in these circuits,
p57
aVand there are some rogue neurons that are misfiring
p58
aVand causing trouble, or sometimes they're underactive
p59
aVand they're not quite working as they should.
p60
aa(lp61
VNow, the manifestation of this
p62
aVdepends on where in the brain these neurons are.
p63
aVSo when these neurons are in the motor circuit,
p64
aVyou get dysfunction in the movement system,
p65
aVand you get things like Parkinson's disease.
p66
aVWhen the malfunction is in a circuit that regulates your mood,
p67
aVyou get things like depression,
p68
aVand when it is in a circuit that controls your memory and cognitive function,
p69
aVthen you get things like Alzheimer's disease.
p70
aVSo what we've been able to do is to pinpoint
p71
aVwhere these disturbances are in the brain,
p72
aVand we've been able to intervene within these circuits
p73
aVin the brain to either turn them up or turn them down.
p74
aVSo this is very much like choosing the correct station
p75
aVon the radio dial.
p76
aVOnce you choose the right station, whether it be jazz or opera,
p77
aVin our case whether it be movement or mood,
p78
aVwe can put the dial there,
p79
aVand then we can use a second button to adjust the volume,
p80
aVto turn it up or turn it down.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo what I'm going to tell you about
p83
aVis using the circuitry of the brain to implant electrodes
p84
aVand turning areas of the brain up and down
p85
aVto see if we can help our patients.
p86
aVAnd this is accomplished using this kind of device,
p87
aVand this is called deep brain stimulation.
p88
aVSo what we're doing is placing these electrodes throughout the brain.
p89
aVAgain, we are making holes in the skull about the size of a dime,
p90
aVputting an electrode in, and then this electrode
p91
aVis completely underneath the skin
p92
aVdown to a pacemaker in the chest,
p93
aVand with a remote control very much like a television remote control,
p94
aVwe can adjust how much electricity we deliver
p95
aVto these areas of the brain.
p96
aVWe can turn it up or down, on or off.
p97
aVNow, about a hundred thousand patients in the world
p98
aVhave received deep brain stimulation,
p99
aVand I'm going to show you some examples
p100
aVof using deep brain stimulation to treat disorders of movement,
p101
aVdisorders of mood and disorders of cognition.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo this looks something like this when it's in the brain.
p104
aVYou see the electrode going through the skull into the brain
p105
aVand resting there, and we can place this really anywhere in the brain.
p106
aVI tell my friends that no neuron is safe
p107
aVfrom a neurosurgeon, because we can really reach
p108
aVjust about anywhere in the brain quite safely now.
p109
aa(lp110
VNow the first example I'm going to show you is a patient
p111
aVwith Parkinson's disease,
p112
aVand this lady has Parkinson's disease,
p113
aVand she has these electrodes in her brain,
p114
aVand I'm going to show you what she's like
p115
aVwhen the electrodes are turned off and she has her Parkinson's symptoms,
p116
aVand then we're going to turn it on.
p117
aVSo this looks something like this.
p118
aVThe electrodes are turned off now, and you can see that she has tremor.
p119
aV(Video) Man: Okay. Woman: I can't. Man: Can you try to touch my finger?
p120
aV(Video) Man: That's a little better. Woman: That side is better.
p121
aVWe're now going to turn it on.
p122
aVIt's on. Just turned it on.
p123
aVAnd this works like that, instantly.
p124
aVAnd the difference between shaking in this way and not \u2014
p125
aV(Applause)
p126
aVThe difference between shaking in this way and not is related to the misbehavior
p127
aVof 25,000 neurons in her subthalamic nucleus.
p128
aVSo we now know how to find these troublemakers
p129
aVand tell them, "Gentlemen, that's enough.
p130
aVWe want you to stop doing that."
p131
aVAnd we do that with electricity.
p132
aVSo we use electricity to dictate how they fire,
p133
aVand we try to block their misbehavior using electricity.
p134
aVSo in this case, we are suppressing the activity of abnormal neurons.
p135
aa(lp136
VWe started using this technique in other problems,
p137
aVand I'm going to tell you about a fascinating problem
p138
aVthat we encountered, a case of dystonia.
p139
aVSo dystonia is a disorder affecting children.
p140
aVIt's a genetic disorder, and it involves a twisting motion,
p141
aVand these children get progressively more and more twisting
p142
aVuntil they can't breathe, until they get sores,
p143
aVurinary infections, and then they die.
p144
aVSo back in 1997, I was asked to see this young boy,
p145
aVperfectly normal. He has this genetic form of dystonia.
p146
aVThere are eight children in the family.
p147
aVFive of them have dystonia.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo here he is.
p150
aVThis boy is nine years old, perfectly normal until the age six,
p151
aVand then he started twisting his body, first the right foot,
p152
aVthen the left foot, then the right arm, then the left arm,
p153
aVthen the trunk, and then by the time he arrived,
p154
aVwithin the course of one or two years of the disease onset,
p155
aVhe could no longer walk, he could no longer stand.
p156
aVHe was crippled, and indeed the natural progression
p157
aVas this gets worse is for them to become progressively twisted,
p158
aVprogressively disabled, and many of these children do not survive.
p159
aVSo he is one of five kids.
p160
aVThe only way he could get around was crawling on his belly like this.
p161
aVHe did not respond to any drugs.
p162
aVWe did not know what to do with this boy.
p163
aVWe did not know what operation to do,
p164
aVwhere to go in the brain,
p165
aVbut on the basis of our results in Parkinson's disease,
p166
aVwe reasoned, why don't we try to suppress
p167
aVthe same area in the brain that we suppressed
p168
aVin Parkinson's disease, and let's see what happens?
p169
aVSo here he was. We operated on him
p170
aVhoping that he would get better. We did not know.
p171
aVSo here he is now, back in Israel where he lives,
p172
aVthree months after the procedure, and here he is.
p173
aa(lp174
V(Applause)
p175
aa(lp176
VOn the basis of this result, this is now a procedure
p177
aVthat's done throughout the world,
p178
aVand there have been hundreds of children
p179
aVthat have been helped with this kind of surgery.
p180
aVThis boy is now in university
p181
aVand leads quite a normal life.
p182
aVThis has been one of the most satisfying cases
p183
aVthat I have ever done in my entire career,
p184
aVto restore movement and walking to this kind of child.
p185
aa(lp186
V(Applause)
p187
aa(lp188
VWe realized that perhaps we could use this technology
p189
aVnot only in circuits that control your movement
p190
aVbut also circuits that control other things,
p191
aVand the next thing that we took on
p192
aVwas circuits that control your mood.
p193
aVAnd we decided to take on depression,
p194
aVand the reason we took on depression is because it's so prevalent,
p195
aVand as you know, there are many treatments for depression,
p196
aVwith medication and psychotherapy,
p197
aVeven electroconvulsive therapy,
p198
aVbut there are millions of people,
p199
aVand there are still 10 or 20 percent of patients with depression
p200
aVthat do not respond, and it is these patients that we want to help.
p201
aVAnd let's see if we can use this technique
p202
aVto help these patients with depression.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo the first thing we did was, we compared,
p205
aVwhat's different in the brain of someone with depression
p206
aVand someone who is normal,
p207
aVand what we did was PET scans to look at the blood flow of the brain,
p208
aVand what we noticed is that in patients with depression
p209
aVcompared to normals,
p210
aVareas of the brain are shut down,
p211
aVand those are the areas in blue.
p212
aVSo here you really have the blues,
p213
aVand the areas in blue are areas that are involved
p214
aVin motivation, in drive and decision-making,
p215
aVand indeed, if you're severely depressed as these patients were,
p216
aVthose are impaired. You lack motivation and drive.
p217
aVThe other thing we discovered
p218
aVwas an area that was overactive, area 25,
p219
aVseen there in red,
p220
aVand area 25 is the sadness center of the brain.
p221
aVIf I make any of you sad, for example, I make you remember
p222
aVthe last time you saw your parent before they died
p223
aVor a friend before they died,
p224
aVthis area of the brain lights up.
p225
aVIt is the sadness center of the brain.
p226
aVAnd so patients with depression have hyperactivity.
p227
aVThe area of the brain for sadness is on red hot.
p228
aVThe thermostat is set at 100 degrees,
p229
aVand the other areas of the brain, involved in drive and motivation, are shut down.
p230
aVSo we wondered, can we place electrodes in this area of sadness
p231
aVand see if we can turn down the thermostat,
p232
aVcan we turn down the activity,
p233
aVand what will be the consequence of that?
p234
aa(lp235
VSo we went ahead and implanted electrodes in patients with depression.
p236
aVThis is work done with my colleague Helen Mayberg from Emory.
p237
aVAnd we placed electrodes in area 25,
p238
aVand in the top scan you see before the operation,
p239
aVarea 25, the sadness area is red hot,
p240
aVand the frontal lobes are shut down in blue,
p241
aVand then, after three months of continuous stimulation,
p242
aV24 hours a day, or six months of continuous stimulation,
p243
aVwe have a complete reversal of this.
p244
aVWe're able to drive down area 25,
p245
aVdown to a more normal level,
p246
aVand we're able to turn back online
p247
aVthe frontal lobes of the brain,
p248
aVand indeed we're seeing very striking results
p249
aVin these patients with severe depression.
p250
aVSo now we are in clinical trials, and are in Phase III clinical trials,
p251
aVand this may become a new procedure,
p252
aVif it's safe and we find that it's effective,
p253
aVto treat patients with severe depression.
p254
aa(lp255
VI've shown you that we can use deep brain stimulation
p256
aVto treat the motor system
p257
aVin cases of Parkinson's disease and dystonia.
p258
aVI've shown you that we can use it to treat a mood circuit
p259
aVin cases of depression.
p260
aVCan we use deep brain stimulation to make you smarter?
p261
aV(Laughter)
p262
aVAnybody interested in that?
p263
aV(Applause)
p264
aVOf course we can, right?
p265
aa(lp266
VSo what we've decided to do is
p267
aVwe're going to try to turbocharge
p268
aVthe memory circuits in the brain.
p269
aVWe're going to place electrodes within the circuits
p270
aVthat regulate your memory and cognitive function
p271
aVto see if we can turn up their activity.
p272
aVNow we're not going to do this in normal people.
p273
aVWe're going to do this in people that have cognitive deficits,
p274
aVand we've chosen to treat patients with Alzheimer's disease
p275
aVwho have cognitive and memory deficits.
p276
aVAs you know, this is the main symptom
p277
aVof early onset Alzheimer's disease.
p278
aVSo we've placed electrodes within this circuit
p279
aVin an area of the brain called the fornix,
p280
aVwhich is the highway in and out of this memory circuit,
p281
aVwith the idea to see if we can turn on this memory circuit,
p282
aVand whether that can, in turn, help these patients
p283
aVwith Alzheimer's disease.
p284
aa(lp285
VNow it turns out that in Alzheimer's disease,
p286
aVthere's a huge deficit in glucose utilization in the brain.
p287
aVThe brain is a bit of a hog when it comes to using glucose.
p288
aVIt uses 20 percent of all your \u2014
p289
aVeven though it only weighs two percent \u2014
p290
aVit uses 10 times more glucose than it should based on its weight.
p291
aVTwenty percent of all the glucose in your body is used by the brain,
p292
aVand as you go from being normal
p293
aVto having mild cognitive impairment,
p294
aVwhich is a precursor for Alzheimer's, all the way to Alzheimer's disease,
p295
aVthen there are areas of the brain that stop using glucose.
p296
aVThey shut down. They turn off.
p297
aVAnd indeed, what we see is that these areas in red
p298
aVaround the outside ribbon of the brain
p299
aVare progressively getting more and more blue
p300
aVuntil they shut down completely.
p301
aVThis is analogous to having a power failure
p302
aVin an area of the brain, a regional power failure.
p303
aVSo the lights are out in parts of the brain
p304
aVin patients with Alzheimer's disease,
p305
aVand the question is, are the lights out forever,
p306
aVor can we turn the lights back on?
p307
aVCan we get those areas of the brain to use glucose once again?
p308
aa(lp309
VSo this is what we did. We implanted electrodes in the fornix
p310
aVof patients with Alzheimer's disease, we turned it on,
p311
aVand we looked at what happens to glucose use in the brain.
p312
aVAnd indeed, at the top, you'll see before the surgery,
p313
aVthe areas in blue are the areas that use less glucose than normal,
p314
aVpredominantly the parietal and temporal lobes.
p315
aVThese areas of the brain are shut down.
p316
aVThe lights are out in these areas of the brain.
p317
aVWe then put in the DBS electrodes and we wait for a month
p318
aVor a year, and the areas in red
p319
aVrepresent the areas where we increase glucose utilization.
p320
aVAnd indeed, we are able to get these areas of the brain
p321
aVthat were not using glucose to use glucose once again.
p322
aVSo the message here is that, in Alzheimer's disease,
p323
aVthe lights are out, but there is someone home,
p324
aVand we're able to turn the power back on
p325
aVto these areas of the brain, and as we do so,
p326
aVwe expect that their functions will return.
p327
aa(lp328
VSo this is now in clinical trials.
p329
aVWe are going to operate on 50 patients
p330
aVwith early Alzheimer's disease
p331
aVto see whether this is safe and effective,
p332
aVwhether we can improve their neurologic function.
p333
aa(lp334
V(Applause)
p335
aa(lp336
VSo the message I want to leave you with today is that,
p337
aVindeed, there are several circuits in the brain
p338
aVthat are malfunctioning across various disease states,
p339
aVwhether we're talking about Parkinson's disease,
p340
aVdepression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's.
p341
aVWe are now learning to understand what are the circuits,
p342
aVwhat are the areas of the brain that are responsible for
p343
aVthe clinical signs and the symptoms of those diseases.
p344
aVWe can now reach those circuits.
p345
aVWe can introduce electrodes within those circuits.
p346
aVWe can graduate the activity of those circuits.
p347
aVWe can turn them down if they are overactive,
p348
aVif they're causing trouble, trouble that is felt throughout the brain,
p349
aVor we can turn them up if they are underperforming,
p350
aVand in so doing, we think that we may be able to help
p351
aVthe overall function of the brain.
p352
aa(lp353
VThe implications of this, of course, is that we may be able
p354
aVto modify the symptoms of the disease,
p355
aVbut I haven't told you but there's also some evidence
p356
aVthat we might be able to help the repair of damaged areas of the brain using electricity,
p357
aVand this is something for the future, to see if, indeed,
p358
aVwe not only change the activity but also
p359
aVsome of the reparative functions of the brain
p360
aVcan be harvested.
p361
aa(lp362
VSo I envision that we're going to see a great expansion
p363
aVof indications of this technique.
p364
aVWe're going to see electrodes being placed for many disorders of the brain.
p365
aVOne of the most exciting things about this is that, indeed,
p366
aVit involves multidisciplinary work.
p367
aVIt involves the work of engineers, of imaging scientists,
p368
aVof basic scientists, of neurologists,
p369
aVpsychiatrists, neurosurgeons, and certainly at the interface
p370
aVof these multiple disciplines that there's the excitement.
p371
aVAnd I think that we will see that
p372
aVwe will be able to chase more of these evil spirits
p373
aVout from the brain as time goes on,
p374
aVand the consequence of that, of course, will be
p375
aVthat we will be able to help many more patients.
p376
aa(lp377
VThank you very much.

(lp4
VI'd like to do pretty much what I did the first time,
p5
aVwhich is to choose a light-hearted theme.
p6
aVLast time, I talked about death and dying.
p7
aVThis time, I'm going to talk about mental illness.
p8
aVBut it has to be technological,
p9
aVso I'll talk about electroshock therapy. (Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VYou know, ever since man had any notion
p12
aVthat some of his other people, his colleagues,
p13
aVcould be different, could be strange, could be severely depressed
p14
aVor what we now recognize as schizophrenia,
p15
aVhe was certain that this kind of illness
p16
aVhad to come from evil spirits getting into the body.
p17
aVSo, the way of treating these diseases
p18
aVin early times was to, in some way or other,
p19
aVexorcise those evil spirits, and this is still going on, as you know.
p20
aa(lp21
VBut it wasn't enough to use the priests.
p22
aVWhen medicine became somewhat scientific, in about 450 BC,
p23
aVwith Hippocrates and those boys,
p24
aVthey tried to look for herbs, plants
p25
aVthat would literally shake the bad spirits out.
p26
aVSo, they found certain plants that could cause convulsions.
p27
aVAnd the herbals, the botanical books of up to the late Middle Ages,
p28
aVthe Renaissance are filled with prescriptions
p29
aVfor causing convulsions to shake the evil spirits out.
p30
aa(lp31
VFinally, in about the sixteenth century,
p32
aVa physician whose name was Theophrastus Bombastus Aureolus von Hohenheim,
p33
aVcalled Paracelsus, a name probably familiar to some people here \u2014
p34
aV(Laughter) \u2014 good, old Paracelsus
p35
aVfound that he could predict the degree of convulsion
p36
aVby using a measured amount of camphor to produce the convulsion.
p37
aVCan you imagine going to your closet, pulling out a mothball, and
p38
aVchewing on it if you're feeling depressed?
p39
aVIt's better than Prozac, but I wouldn't recommend it.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo what we see in the seventeenth, eighteenth century
p42
aVis the continued search for medications other than camphor that'll do the trick.
p43
aVWell, along comes Benjamin Franklin,
p44
aVand he comes close to convulsing himself
p45
aVwith a bolt of electricity off the end of his kite.
p46
aVAnd so people begin thinking in terms of electricity to produce convulsions.
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd then, we fast-forward to about 1932,
p49
aVwhen three Italian psychiatrists, who were largely treating depression,
p50
aVbegan to notice among their patients, who were also epileptics,
p51
aVthat if they had an epileptic \u2014 a series of epileptic fits,
p52
aVa lot of them in a row \u2014 the depression would very frequently lift.
p53
aVNot only would it lift, but it might never return.
p54
aVSo they got very interested in producing convulsions,
p55
aVmeasured types of convulsions.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd they thought, "Well, we've got electricity, we'll plug somebody into the wall.
p58
aVThat always makes hair stand up and people shake a lot."
p59
aVSo, they tried it on a few pigs, and none of the pigs were killed.
p60
aVSo, they went to the police and they said,
p61
aV"We know that at the Rome railroad station,
p62
aVthere are all these lost souls wandering around,
p63
aVmuttering gibberish. Can you bring one of them to us?"
p64
aVSomeone who is, as the Italians say, "cagoots."
p65
aVSo they found this "cagoots" guy,
p66
aVa 39-year-old man who was really hopelessly schizophrenic,
p67
aVwho was known, had been known for months,
p68
aVto be literally defecating on himself,
p69
aVtalking nothing that made any sense,
p70
aVand they brought him into the hospital.
p71
aVSo these three psychiatrists, after about two or three weeks of observation,
p72
aVlaid him down on a table,
p73
aVconnected his temples to a very small source of current.
p74
aVThey thought, "Well, we'll try 55 volts, two-tenths of a second.
p75
aVThat's not going to do anything terrible to him."
p76
aVSo they did that.
p77
aa(lp78
VWell, I have the following from a firsthand observer,
p79
aVwho told me this about 35 years ago,
p80
aVwhen I was thinking about these things
p81
aVfor some research project of mine.
p82
aVHe said, "This fellow" \u2014 remember, he wasn't even put to sleep \u2014
p83
aV"after this major grand mal convulsion,
p84
aVsat right up, looked at these three fellas and said,
p85
aV'What the fuck are you assholes trying to do?' "
p86
aV(Laughter)
p87
aVIf I could only say that in Italian.
p88
aa(lp89
VWell, they were happy as could be, because he
p90
aVhadn't said a rational word in the weeks of observation.
p91
aVSo they plugged him in again,
p92
aVand this time they used 110 volts for half a second.
p93
aVAnd to their amazement, after it was over,
p94
aVhe began speaking like he was perfectly well.
p95
aVHe relapsed a little bit, they gave him a series of treatments,
p96
aVand he was essentially cured.
p97
aVBut of course, having schizophrenia,
p98
aVwithin a few months, it returned.
p99
aa(lp100
VBut they wrote a paper about this,
p101
aVand everybody in the Western world began using electricity
p102
aVto convulse people who were either schizophrenic or severely depressed.
p103
aVIt didn't work very well on the schizophrenics,
p104
aVbut it was pretty clear in the '30s and by the middle of the '40s
p105
aVthat electroconvulsive therapy was very, very effective
p106
aVin the treatment of depression.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd of course, in those days, there were no antidepressant drugs,
p109
aVand it became very, very popular.
p110
aVThey would anesthetize people,
p111
aVconvulse them, but the real difficulty was
p112
aVthat there was no way to paralyze muscles.
p113
aVSo people would have a real grand mal seizure.
p114
aVBones were broken. Especially in old, fragile people,
p115
aVyou couldn't use it.
p116
aVAnd then in the 1950s, late 1950s, the so-called muscle relaxants
p117
aVwere developed by pharmacologists,
p118
aVand it got so that you could induce a complete convulsion,
p119
aVan electroencephalographic convulsion \u2014 you could see it on the brain waves \u2014
p120
aVwithout causing any convulsion in the body except a little bit of twitching of the toes.
p121
aVSo again, it was very, very popular and very, very useful.
p122
aa(lp123
VWell, you know, in the middle '60s,
p124
aVthe first antidepressants came out. Tofranil was the first.
p125
aVIn the late '70s, early '80s, there were others,
p126
aVand they were very effective.
p127
aVAnd patients' rights groups seemed to get very upset
p128
aVabout the kinds of things that they would witness.
p129
aVAnd so the whole idea of electroconvulsive, electroshock therapy disappeared,
p130
aVbut has had a renaissance in the last 10 years.
p131
aVAnd the reason that it has had a renaissance
p132
aVis that probably about 10 percent of the people, severe depressives,
p133
aVdo not respond, regardless of what is done for them.
p134
aa(lp135
VNow, why am I telling you this story at this meeting?
p136
aVI'm telling you this story, because actually ever since
p137
aVRichard called me and asked me to talk about
p138
aV\u2014 as he asked all of his speakers \u2014
p139
aVto talk about something that would be new to this audience,
p140
aVthat we had never talked about, never written about,
p141
aVI've been planning this moment.
p142
aVThis reason really is that I am a man who, almost 30 years ago,
p143
aVhad his life saved by two long courses of electroshock therapy.
p144
aVAnd let me tell you this story.
p145
aa(lp146
VI was, in the 1960s, in a marriage. To use the word bad
p147
aVwould be perhaps the understatement of the year.
p148
aVIt was dreadful.
p149
aVThere are, I'm sure, enough divorced people in this room
p150
aVto know about the hostility, the anger, who knows what.
p151
aVBeing someone who had had a very difficult childhood,
p152
aVa very difficult adolescence \u2014
p153
aVit had to do with not quite poverty but close.
p154
aVIt had to do with being brought up in a family where no one spoke English,
p155
aVno one could read or write English.
p156
aVIt had to do with death and disease and lots of other things.
p157
aVI was a little prone to depression.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo, as things got worse, as we really began to hate each other,
p160
aVI became progressively depressed over a period of a couple of years,
p161
aVtrying to save this marriage,
p162
aVwhich was inevitably not to be saved.
p163
aVFinally, I would schedule \u2014 all my major surgical cases,
p164
aVI was scheduling them for 12, one o'clock in the afternoon,
p165
aVbecause I couldn't get out of bed before about 11 o'clock.
p166
aVAnd anybody who's been depressed here knows what that's like.
p167
aVI couldn't even pull the covers off myself.
p168
aa(lp169
VWell, you're in a university medical center,
p170
aVwhere everybody knows everybody, and it's perfectly clear to my colleagues,
p171
aVso my referrals began to decrease.
p172
aVAs my referrals began to decrease,
p173
aVI clearly became increasingly depressed
p174
aVuntil I thought, my God, I can't work anymore.
p175
aVAnd, in fact, it didn't make any difference
p176
aVbecause I didn't have any patients anymore.
p177
aa(lp178
VSo, with the advice of my physician,
p179
aVI had myself admitted to the acute care psychiatric unit of our university hospital.
p180
aVAnd my colleagues, who had known me since medical school
p181
aVin that place, said, "Don't worry, chap. Six weeks,
p182
aVyou're back in the operating room. Everything's going to be great."
p183
aVWell, you know what bovine stercus is?
p184
aVThat proved to be a lot of bovine stercus.
p185
aVI know some people who got tenure in that place with lies like that.
p186
aV(Laughter)
p187
aVSo I was one of their failures.
p188
aa(lp189
VBut it wasn't that simple. Because by the time
p190
aVI got out of that unit, I was not functional at all.
p191
aVI could hardly see five feet in front of myself.
p192
aVI shuffled when I walked. I was bowed over.
p193
aVI rarely bathed. I sometimes didn't shave. It was dreadful.
p194
aVAnd it was clear \u2014 not to me,
p195
aVbecause nothing was clear to me at that time anymore \u2014
p196
aVthat I would need long-term hospitalization
p197
aVin that awful place called a mental hospital.
p198
aVSo I was admitted, in 1973, in the spring of 1973,
p199
aVto the Institute of Living, which used to be called the Hartford Retreat.
p200
aVIt was founded in the eighteenth century,
p201
aVthe largest psychiatric hospital in the state of
p202
aVConnecticut, other than the huge public hospitals
p203
aVthat existed at that time.
p204
aa(lp205
VAnd they tried everything they had.
p206
aVThey tried the usual psychotherapy.
p207
aVThey tried every medication available in those days.
p208
aVAnd they did have Tofranil and other things \u2014 Mellaril, who knows what.
p209
aVNothing happened except that I got jaundiced from one of these things.
p210
aVAnd finally, because I was well known in Connecticut,
p211
aVthey decided they better have a meeting of the senior staff.
p212
aVAll the senior staff got together, and I later found out what happened.
p213
aa(lp214
VThey put all their heads together and they decided
p215
aVthat there was nothing that could be done
p216
aVfor this surgeon who had essentially separated himself from the world,
p217
aVwho by that time had become so overwhelmed,
p218
aVnot just with depression and feelings
p219
aVof worthlessness and inadequacy,
p220
aVbut with obsessional thinking,
p221
aVobsessional thinking about coincidences.
p222
aVAnd there were particular numbers that every time I saw them,
p223
aVjust got me dreadfully upset \u2014 all kinds of ritualistic observances,
p224
aVjust awful, awful stuff.
p225
aVRemember when you were a kid, and you had to step on every line?
p226
aVWell, I was a grown man who had all of these rituals,
p227
aVand it got so there was a throbbing, there was a ferocious fear in my head.
p228
aVYou've seen this painting by Edvard Munch,
p229
aVThe Scream. Every moment was a scream.
p230
aVIt was impossible. So they decided there was no therapy,
p231
aVthere was no treatment. But there was one treatment,
p232
aVwhich actually had been pioneered at the Hartford hospital in the early 1940s,
p233
aVand you can imagine what it was. It was pre-frontal lobotomy.
p234
aVSo they decided \u2014 I didn't know this, again,
p235
aVI found this out later \u2014
p236
aVthat the only thing that could be done was
p237
aVfor this 43-year-old man to have a pre-frontal
p238
aVlobotomy.
p239
aa(lp240
VWell, as in all hospitals, there was a resident
p241
aVassigned to my case. He was 27 years old,
p242
aVand he would meet with me two or three times a week.
p243
aVAnd of course, I had been there, what, three or four months at the time.
p244
aVAnd he asked to meet with the senior staff, and they agreed to meet with him
p245
aVbecause he was very well thought of in that place.
p246
aVThey thought he had a really extraordinary future.
p247
aa(lp248
VAnd he dug in his heels and said,
p249
aV"No. I know this man better than any of you. I have met with him over and over again.
p250
aVYou've just seen him from time to time. You've read reports and so forth.
p251
aVI really honestly believe that the basic problem here is pure depression,
p252
aVand all of the obsessional thinking comes out of it.
p253
aVAnd you know, of course, what'll happen if you do a pre-frontal lobotomy.
p254
aVAny of the results along the spectrum,
p255
aVfrom pretty bad to terrible, terrible, terrible
p256
aVis going to happen. If he does the best he can,
p257
aVhe will have no further obsessions,
p258
aVprobably no depression, but his affect will be dulled,
p259
aVhe will never go back to surgery,
p260
aVhe will never be the loving father that he was to his two children,
p261
aVhis life will be changed. If he has the usual result,
p262
aVhe will end up like 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'
p263
aVAnd you know about that, just essentially in a stupor the rest of his life."
p264
aa(lp265
VWell, he said, "Can't we try a course of electroshock therapy?"
p266
aVAnd you know why they agreed? They agreed to humor him.
p267
aVThey just thought, "Well, we'll give a course of 10.
p268
aVAnd so we'll lose a little time. Big deal. It doesn't make any difference."
p269
aVSo they gave the course of 10,
p270
aVand the first \u2014 the usual course, incidentally, was six to eight
p271
aVand still is six to eight.
p272
aVPlugged me into the wires, put me to sleep, gave me the muscle relaxant.
p273
aVSix didn't work. Seven didn't work.
p274
aVEight didn't work. At nine, I noticed \u2014
p275
aVand it's wonderful that I could notice anything
p276
aV\u2014 I noticed a change. And at 10, I noticed a real change.
p277
aa(lp278
VAnd he went back to them, and they agreed to do another 10.
p279
aVAgain, not a single one of them
p280
aV\u2014 I think there are about seven or eight of them \u2014
p281
aVthought this would do any good. They thought this was a temporary change.
p282
aVBut, lo and behold, by 16, by 17,
p283
aVthere were demonstrable differences in the way I felt.
p284
aVBy 18 and 19, I was sleeping through the night.
p285
aVAnd by 20, I had the sense, I really had the sense
p286
aVthat I could overcome this,
p287
aVthat I was now strong enough that by an act of will,
p288
aVI could blow the obsessional thinking away.
p289
aVI could blow the depression away.
p290
aa(lp291
VAnd I've never forgotten \u2014 I never will forget
p292
aV\u2014 standing in the kitchen of the unit,
p293
aVit was a Sunday morning in January of 1974,
p294
aVstanding in the kitchen by myself and thinking, "I've got the strength now to do this."
p295
aVIt was as though those tightly coiled wires in my head had been disconnected
p296
aVand I could think clearly.
p297
aVBut I need a formula. I need some thing to say to myself
p298
aVwhen I begin thinking obsessionally, obsessively.
p299
aVWell, the Gilbert and Sullivan fans in this room
p300
aVwill remember "Ruddigore," and they will remember Mad Margaret,
p301
aVand they will remember that she was married
p302
aVto a fellow named Sir Despard Murgatroyd.
p303
aVAnd she used to go nuts, every five minutes or so in the play,
p304
aVand he said to her, "We must have a word to bring you back to reality,
p305
aVand the word, my dear, will be 'Basingstoke.'"
p306
aVSo every time she got a little nuts,
p307
aVhe would say, "Basingstoke!" And she would say,
p308
aV"Basingstoke, it is." And she would be fine for a little while.
p309
aa(lp310
VWell, you know, I'm from the Bronx. I can't say "Basingstoke."
p311
aVBut I had something better. And it was very simple.
p312
aVIt was, "Ah, fuck it!"
p313
aV(Laughter) Much better than "Basingstoke,"
p314
aVat least for me. And it worked \u2014 my God, it worked.
p315
aVEvery time I would begin thinking obsessionally \u2014
p316
aVagain, once more, after 20 shock treatments
p317
aV\u2014 I would say, "Ah, fuck it."
p318
aVAnd things got better and better,
p319
aVand within three or four months,
p320
aVI was discharged from that hospital, and I joined a group of surgeons
p321
aVwhere I could work with other people in the community,
p322
aVnot in New Haven, but fairly close by.
p323
aVI stayed there for three years.
p324
aVAt the end of three years, I went back to New Haven,
p325
aVhad remarried by that time.
p326
aVI brought my wife with me, actually, to make sure I could get through this.
p327
aVMy children came back to live with us.
p328
aVWe had two more children after that.
p329
aVResuscitated the career, even better than it had been before.
p330
aVWent right back into the university
p331
aVand began to write books.
p332
aVWell, you know, it's been a wonderful life.
p333
aVIt's been, as I said, close to 30 years.
p334
aVI stopped doing surgery about six years ago
p335
aVand became a full-time writer, as many people know.
p336
aVBut it's been very exciting. It's been very happy.
p337
aa(lp338
VEvery once in a while, I have to say, "Ah, fuck it."
p339
aVEvery once in a while, I get somewhat depressed and a little obsessional.
p340
aVSo, I'm not free of all of this. But it's worked. It's always worked.
p341
aVWhy have I chosen, after never, ever talking about this, to talk about it now?
p342
aVWell, those of you who know some of these books
p343
aVknow that one is about death and dying,
p344
aVone is about the human body and the human spirit,
p345
aVone is about the way mystical thoughts are constantly in our minds,
p346
aVand they have always to do with my own personal experiences.
p347
aVOne might think reading these books
p348
aV\u2014 and I've gotten thousands of letters about them
p349
aVby people who do think this \u2014
p350
aVthat based on my life's history as I've portrayed in the books,
p351
aVmy early life's history, I am someone who has overcome adversity.
p352
aVThat I am someone who has drunk, drank, drunk
p353
aVof the bitter dregs of near-disaster in childhood
p354
aVand emerged not just unscathed but strengthened.
p355
aVI really have it figured out, so that I can advise people about
p356
aVdeath and dying, so that I can talk about mysticism and the human spirit.
p357
aa(lp358
VAnd I've always felt guilty about that.
p359
aVI've always felt that somehow I was an impostor
p360
aVbecause my readers don't know what I have just told you.
p361
aVIt's known by some people in New Haven, obviously,
p362
aVbut it is not generally known.
p363
aVSo one of the reasons that I have come here to talk about this today
p364
aVis to \u2014 frankly, selfishly \u2014
p365
aVunburden myself and let it be known
p366
aVthat this is not an untroubled mind that has written all of these books.
p367
aVBut more importantly, I think,
p368
aVis the fact that a very significant proportion
p369
aVof people in this audience are under 30,
p370
aVand there are many, of course, who are well over 30.
p371
aVFor people under 30, and it looks to me like almost all of you
p372
aV\u2014 I would say all of you \u2014
p373
aVare either on the cusp of a magnificent and exciting career
p374
aVor right into a magnificent and exciting career:
p375
aVanything can happen to you. Things change.
p376
aVAccidents happen. Something from childhood comes back to haunt you.
p377
aVYou can be thrown off the track.
p378
aVI hope it happens to none of you,
p379
aVbut it will probably happen to a small percentage of you.
p380
aa(lp381
VTo those to whom it doesn't happen, there will be adversities.
p382
aVIf I, with the bleakness of spirit,
p383
aVwith no spirit, that I had in the 1970s
p384
aVand no possibility of recovery,
p385
aVas far as that group of very experienced psychiatrists thought,
p386
aVif I can find my way back from this,
p387
aVbelieve me, anybody can find their way back
p388
aVfrom any adversity that exists in their lives.
p389
aa(lp390
VAnd for those who are older, who have lived through
p391
aVperhaps not something as bad as this,
p392
aVbut who have lived through difficult times,
p393
aVperhaps where they lost everything, as I did,
p394
aVand started out all over again, some of these things will seem very familiar.
p395
aVThere is recovery.
p396
aVThere is redemption. And there is resurrection.
p397
aVThere are resurrection themes in every society that has ever been studied,
p398
aVand it is because not just only do we fantasize
p399

VCan any of you
p5
aVremember what you wanted to be
p6
aVwhen you were 17?
p7
aVDo you know what I wanted to be?
p8
aVI wanted to be a biker chick.
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aVI wanted to race cars,
p11
aVand I wanted to be a cowgirl,
p12
aVand I wanted to be Mowgli from "The Jungle Book."
p13
aVBecause they were all about being free,
p14
aVthe wind in your hair \u2014 just to be free.
p15
aVAnd on my seventeenth birthday,
p16
aVmy parents, knowing how much I loved speed,
p17
aVgave me one driving lesson
p18
aVfor my seventeenth birthday.
p19
aVNot that we could have afforded I drive,
p20
aVbut to give me the dream of driving.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd on my seventeenth birthday,
p23
aVI accompanied my little sister
p24
aVin complete innocence,
p25
aVas I always had all my life \u2014
p26
aVmy visually impaired sister \u2014
p27
aVto go to see an eye specialist.
p28
aVBecause big sisters
p29
aVare always supposed to support their little sisters.
p30
aVAnd my little sister wanted to be a pilot \u2014
p31
aVGod help her.
p32
aVSo I used to get my eyes tested
p33
aVjust for fun.
p34
aVAnd on my seventeenth birthday,
p35
aVafter my fake eye exam,
p36
aVthe eye specialist just noticed it happened to be my birthday.
p37
aVAnd he said, "So what are you going to do to celebrate?"
p38
aVAnd I took that driving lesson,
p39
aVand I said, "I'm going to learn how to drive."
p40
aVAnd then there was a silence \u2014
p41
aVone of those awful silences
p42
aVwhen you know something's wrong.
p43
aVAnd he turned to my mother,
p44
aVand he said, "You haven't told her yet?"
p45
aVOn my seventeenth birthday,
p46
aVas Janis Ian would best say,
p47
aVI learned the truth at 17.
p48
aVI am, and have been since birth,
p49
aVlegally blind.
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd you know,
p52
aVhow on earth did I get to 17
p53
aVand not know that?
p54
aVWell, if anybody says country music isn't powerful,
p55
aVlet me tell you this:
p56
aVI got there
p57
aVbecause my father's passion for Johnny Cash
p58
aVand a song, "A Boy Named Sue."
p59
aVI'm the eldest of three. I was born in 1971.
p60
aVAnd very shortly after my birth,
p61
aVmy parents found out I had a condition called ocular albinism.
p62
aVAnd what the hell does that mean to you?
p63
aVSo let me just tell you, the great part of all of this?
p64
aVI can't see this clock and I can't see the timing,
p65
aVso holy God, woohoo! (Laughter)
p66
aVI might buy some more time.
p67
aVBut more importantly, let me tell you \u2014
p68
aVI'm going to come up really close here. Don't freak out, Pat.
p69
aVHey.
p70
aVSee this hand?
p71
aVBeyond this hand is a world of Vaseline.
p72
aVEvery man in this room, even you, Steve,
p73
aVis George Clooney.
p74
aV(Laughter)
p75
aVAnd every woman, you are so beautiful.
p76
aVAnd when I want to look beautiful, I step three feet away from the mirror,
p77
aVand I don't have to see these lines etched in my face
p78
aVfrom all the squinting I've done all my life
p79
aVfrom all the dark lights.
p80
aa(lp81
VThe really strange part is
p82
aVthat, at three and a half, just before I was going to school,
p83
aVmy parents made a bizarre, unusual
p84
aVand incredibly brave decision.
p85
aVNo special needs schools.
p86
aVNo labels.
p87
aVNo limitations.
p88
aVMy ability and my potential.
p89
aVAnd they decided to tell me
p90
aVthat I could see.
p91
aVSo just like Johnny Cash's Sue,
p92
aVa boy given a girl's name,
p93
aVI would grow up and learn from experience
p94
aVhow to be tough and how to survive,
p95
aVwhen they were no longer there to protect me,
p96
aVor just take it all away.
p97
aVBut more significantly,
p98
aVthey gave me the ability
p99
aVto believe,
p100
aVtotally, to believe that I could.
p101
aVAnd so when I heard that eye specialist
p102
aVtell me all the things, a big fat "no,"
p103
aVeverybody imagines I was devastated.
p104
aVAnd don't get me wrong, because when I first heard it \u2014
p105
aVaside from the fact that I thought he was insane \u2014
p106
aVI got that thump in my chest,
p107
aVjust that "huh?"
p108
aVBut very quickly I recovered. It was like that.
p109
aVThe first thing I thought about was my mom,
p110
aVwho was crying over beside me.
p111
aVAnd I swear to God, I walked out of his office,
p112
aV"I will drive. I will drive.
p113
aVYou're mad. I'll drive. I know I can drive."
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd with the same dogged determination
p116
aVthat my father had bred into me since I was such a child \u2014
p117
aVhe taught me how to sail,
p118
aVknowing I could never see where I was going, I could never see the shore,
p119
aVand I couldn't see the sails, and I couldn't see the destination.
p120
aVBut he told me to believe
p121
aVand feel the wind in my face.
p122
aVAnd that wind in my face made me believe
p123
aVthat he was mad and I would drive.
p124
aVAnd for the next 11 years,
p125
aVI swore nobody would ever find out that I couldn't see,
p126
aVbecause I didn't want to be a failure,
p127
aVand I didn't want to be weak.
p128
aVAnd I believed I could do it.
p129
aVSo I rammed through life as only a Casey can do.
p130
aVAnd I was an archeologist, and then I broke things.
p131
aVAnd then I managed a restaurant, and then I slipped on things.
p132
aVAnd then I was a masseuse. And then I was a landscape gardener.
p133
aVAnd then I went to business school.
p134
aVAnd you know, disabled people are hugely educated.
p135
aVAnd then I went in and I got a global consulting job with Accenture.
p136
aVAnd they didn't even know.
p137
aVAnd it's extraordinary
p138
aVhow far belief can take you.
p139
aa(lp140
VIn 1999,
p141
aVtwo and a half years into that job,
p142
aVsomething happened.
p143
aVWonderfully, my eyes decided, enough.
p144
aVAnd temporarily,
p145
aVvery unexpectedly,
p146
aVthey dropped.
p147
aVAnd I'm in one of the most competitive environments in the world,
p148
aVwhere you work hard, play hard, you gotta be the best, you gotta be the best.
p149
aVAnd two years in,
p150
aVI really could see very little.
p151
aVAnd I found myself in front of an HR manager
p152
aVin 1999,
p153
aVsaying something I never imagined that I would say.
p154
aVI was 28 years old.
p155
aVI had built a persona all around what I could and couldn't do.
p156
aVAnd I simply said,
p157
aV"I'm sorry.
p158
aVI can't see, and I need help."
p159
aVAsking for help can be incredibly difficult.
p160
aVAnd you all know what it is. You don't need to have a disability to know that.
p161
aVWe all know how hard it is
p162
aVto admit weakness and failure.
p163
aVAnd it's frightening, isn't it?
p164
aVBut all that belief had fueled me so long.
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd can I tell you, operating in the sighted world when you can't see,
p167
aVit's kind of difficult \u2014 it really is.
p168
aVCan I tell you, airports are a disaster.
p169
aVOh, for the love of God.
p170
aVAnd please, any designers out there?
p171
aVOK, designers, please put up your hands, even though I can't even see you.
p172
aVI always end up in the gents' toilets.
p173
aVAnd there's nothing wrong with my sense of smell.
p174
aVBut can I just tell you,
p175
aVthe little sign for a gents' toilet or a ladies' toilet
p176
aVis determined by a triangle.
p177
aVHave you ever tried to see that
p178
aVif you have Vaseline in front of your eyes?
p179
aVIt's such a small thing, right?
p180
aVAnd you know how exhausting it can be
p181
aVto try to be perfect when you're not,
p182
aVor to be somebody that you aren't?
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd so after admitting I couldn't see to HR,
p185
aVthey sent me off to an eye specialist.
p186
aVAnd I had no idea that this man was going to change my life.
p187
aVBut before I got to him, I was so lost.
p188
aVI had no idea who I was anymore.
p189
aVAnd that eye specialist, he didn't bother testing my eyes.
p190
aVGod no, it was therapy.
p191
aVAnd he asked me several questions,
p192
aVof which many were, "Why?
p193
aVWhy are you fighting so hard
p194
aVnot to be yourself?
p195
aVAnd do you love what you do, Caroline?"
p196
aVAnd you know, when you go to a global consulting firm,
p197
aVthey put a chip in your head, and you're like,
p198
aV"I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture.
p199
aVI love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture." (Laughter)
p200
aVTo leave would be failure.
p201
aVAnd he said, "Do you love it?"
p202
aVI couldn't even speak I was so choked up.
p203
aVI just was so \u2014 how do I tell him?
p204
aVAnd then he said to me, "What did you want to be when you were little?"
p205
aVNow listen, I wasn't going to say to him, "Well, I wanted to race cars and motorbikes."
p206
aVHardly appropriate at this moment in time.
p207
aVHe thought I was mad enough anyway.
p208
aVAnd as I left his office,
p209
aVhe called me back
p210
aVand he said, "I think it's time.
p211
aVI think it's time
p212
aVto stop fighting and do something different."
p213
aVAnd that door closed.
p214
aVAnd that silence just outside a doctor's office,
p215
aVthat many of us know.
p216
aVAnd my chest ached.
p217
aVAnd I had no idea where I was going. I had no idea.
p218
aVBut I did know the game was up.
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd I went home, and, because the pain in my chest ached so much,
p221
aVI thought, "I'll go out for a run."
p222
aVReally not a very sensible thing to do.
p223
aVAnd I went on a run that I know so well.
p224
aVI know this run so well, by the back of my hand.
p225
aVI always run it perfectly fine.
p226
aVI count the steps and the lampposts and all those things
p227
aVthat visually impaired people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with.
p228
aVAnd there was a rock that I always missed.
p229
aVAnd I'd never fallen on it, never.
p230
aVAnd there I was crying away,
p231
aVand smash, bash on my rock.
p232
aVBroken, fallen over
p233
aVon this rock
p234
aVin the middle of March in 2000,
p235
aVtypical Irish weather on a Wednesday \u2014
p236
aVgray, snot, tears everywhere,
p237
aVridiculously self-pitying.
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd I was floored, and I was broken,
p240
aVand I was angry.
p241
aVAnd I didn't know what to do.
p242
aVAnd I sat there for quite some time going,
p243
aV"How am I going to get off this rock and go home?
p244
aVBecause who am I going to be?
p245
aVWhat am I going to be?"
p246
aVAnd I thought about my dad,
p247
aVand I thought, "Good God, I'm so not Sue now."
p248
aVAnd I kept thinking over and over in my mind,
p249
aVwhat had happened? Where did it go wrong? Why didn't I understand?
p250
aVAnd you know, the extraordinary part of it
p251
aVis I just simply had no answers.
p252
aVI had lost my belief.
p253
aVLook where my belief had brought me to.
p254
aVAnd now I had lost it. And now I really couldn't see.
p255
aVI was crumpled.
p256
aVAnd then I remember thinking about that eye specialist
p257
aVasking me, "What do you want to be? What do you want to be?
p258
aVWhat did you want to be when you were little? Do you love what you do?
p259
aVDo something different. What do you want to be?
p260
aVDo something different. What do you want to be?"
p261
aVAnd really slowly, slowly, slowly,
p262
aVit happened.
p263
aVAnd it did happen this way.
p264
aVAnd then the minute it came,
p265
aVit blew up in my head
p266
aVand bashed in my heart \u2014
p267
aVsomething different.
p268
aV"Well, how about Mowgli from 'The Jungle Book'?
p269
aVYou don't get more different than that."
p270
aVAnd the moment, and I mean the moment,
p271
aVthe moment that hit me,
p272
aVI swear to God,
p273
aVit was like woo hoo! You know \u2014 something to believe in.
p274
aVAnd nobody can tell me no.
p275
aVYes, you can say I can't be an archeologist.
p276
aVBut you can't tell me, no, I can't be Mowgli, because guess what?
p277
aVNobody's ever done it before, so I'm going to go do it.
p278
aVAnd it doesn't matter whether I'm a boy or a girl, I'm just going to scoot.
p279
aa(lp280
VAnd so I got off that rock, and, oh my God, did I run home.
p281
aVAnd I sprinted home, and I didn't fall, and I didn't crash.
p282
aVAnd I ran up the stairs, and there was one of my favorite books of all time,
p283
aV"Travels on My Elephant" by Mark Shand \u2014 I don't know if any of you know it.
p284
aVAnd I grabbed this book off, and I'm sitting on the couch
p285
aVgoing, "I know what I'm going to do.
p286
aVI know how to be Mowgli.
p287
aVI'm going to go across India
p288
aVon the back of an elephant.
p289
aVI'm going to be an elephant handler."
p290
aVAnd I had no idea
p291
aVhow I was going to be an elephant handler.
p292
aVFrom global management consultant to elephant handler.
p293
aVI had no idea how. I had no idea how you hire an elephant, get an elephant.
p294
aVI didn't speak Hindi. I'd never been to India. Hadn't a clue.
p295
aVBut I knew I would.
p296
aVBecause, when you make a decision at the right time and the right place,
p297
aVGod, that universe makes it happen for you.
p298
aa(lp299
VNine months later, after that day on snot rock,
p300
aVI had the only blind date in my life
p301
aVwith a seven and a half foot elephant called Kanchi.
p302
aVAnd together we would trek a thousand kilometers
p303
aVacross India.
p304
aV(Applause)
p305
aVThe most powerful thing of all,
p306
aVit's not that I didn't achieve before then. Oh my God, I did.
p307
aVBut you know, I was believing in the wrong thing.
p308
aVBecause I wasn't believing in me,
p309
aVreally me, all the bits of me \u2014
p310
aVall the bits of all of us.
p311
aVDo you know how much of us all pretend to be somebody we're not?
p312
aVAnd you know what, when you really believe in yourself and everything about you,
p313
aVit's extraordinary what happens.
p314
aa(lp315
VAnd you know what, that trip, that thousand kilometers,
p316
aVit raised enough money for 6,000 cataract eye operations.
p317
aVSix thousand people got to see because of that.
p318
aVWhen I came home off that elephant,
p319
aVdo you know what the most amazing part was?
p320
aVI chucked in my job at Accenture.
p321
aVI left, and I became a social entrepreneur,
p322
aVand I set up an organization with Mark Shand called Elephant Family,
p323
aVwhich deals with Asian elephant conservation.
p324
aVAnd I set up Kanchi,
p325
aVbecause my organization was always going to be named after my elephant,
p326
aVbecause disability is like the elephant in the room.
p327
aVAnd I wanted to make you see it in a positive way \u2014
p328
aVno charity, no pity.
p329
aVBut I wanted to work only and truly
p330
aVwith business and media leadership
p331
aVto totally reframe disability
p332
aVin a way that was exciting and possible.
p333
aVIt was extraordinary.
p334
aVThat's what I wanted to do.
p335
aVAnd I never thought about noes anymore, or not seeing,
p336
aVor any of that kind of nothing.
p337
aVIt just seemed that it was possible.
p338
aa(lp339
VAnd you know, the oddest part is,
p340
aVwhen I was on my way traveling here to TED,
p341
aVI'll be honest, I was petrified.
p342
aVAnd I speak,
p343
aVbut this is an amazing audience,
p344
aVand what am I doing here?
p345
aVBut as I was traveling here,
p346
aVyou'll be very happy to know,
p347
aVI did use my white symbol stick cane,
p348
aVbecause it's really good to skip queues in the airport.
p349
aVAnd I got my way here
p350
aVbeing happily proud that I couldn't see.
p351
aVAnd the one thing is that a really good friend of mine,
p352
aVhe texted me on the way over, knowing I was scared.
p353
aVEven though I present confident, I was scared.
p354
aVHe said, "Be you."
p355
aVAnd so here I am.
p356
aVThis is me, all of me.
p357
aa(lp358
V(Applause)
p359
aa(lp360
VAnd I have learned, you know what,
p361
aVcars and motorbikes and elephants,
p362
aVthat's not freedom.
p363
aVBeing absolutely true to yourself is freedom.
p364
aVAnd I never needed eyes to see \u2014 never.
p365
aVI simply needed vision and belief.
p366
aVAnd if you truly believe \u2014
p367
aVand I mean believe from the bottom of your heart \u2014
p368
aVyou can make change happen.
p369
aVAnd we need to make it happen,
p370
aVbecause every single one of us \u2014
p371
aVwoman, man, gay, straight,
p372
aVdisabled, perfect,
p373
aVnormal, whatever \u2014
p374
aVeveryone of us
p375
aVmust be the very best of ourselves.
p376
aVI no longer want anybody to be invisible.
p377
aVWe all have to be included.
p378
aVAnd stop with the labels, the limiting.
p379
aVLosing of labels,
p380
aVbecause we are not jam jars.
p381
aVWe are extraordinary, different, wonderful people.
p382
aa(lp383
VThank you.

Then, as founding CEO of Kanchi, in Dublin, she developed a set of best practices for businesses, to help them see &quot;disabled&quot; workers as an asset, as opposed to a liability. Hundreds of companies have adopted these standards, changing their policies and attitudes. In 2004, Casey started the Ability Awards, sponsored by 02, to recognize Irish businesses for their inclusion of people with disabilities, as employees, suppliers, customers and members of the community. The initiative received great international praise and, in 2010, a parallel program was launched in Spain, backed by Telef&oacute;nica.<br /><br />In 2015 Casey founded business inclusion company Binc which, in August 2017, launched #valuable &ndash; a worldwide &lsquo;call to action&rsquo; for business to recognise the value and potential of the 1 billion people living with a disability and position disability equally on the global business agenda.

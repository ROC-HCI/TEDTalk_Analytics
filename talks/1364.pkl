VThe things we make
p5
aVhave one supreme quality \u2014
p6
aVthey live longer than us.
p7
aVWe perish, they survive;
p8
aVwe have one life, they have many lives,
p9
aVand in each life they can mean different things.
p10
aVWhich means that, while we all have one biography,
p11
aVthey have many.
p12
aa(lp13
VI want this morning to talk
p14
aVabout the story, the biography \u2014 or rather the biographies \u2014
p15
aVof one particular object,
p16
aVone remarkable thing.
p17
aVIt doesn't, I agree,
p18
aVlook very much.
p19
aVIt's about the size of a rugby ball.
p20
aVIt's made of clay,
p21
aVand it's been fashioned
p22
aVinto a cylinder shape,
p23
aVcovered with close writing
p24
aVand then baked dry in the sun.
p25
aVAnd as you can see,
p26
aVit's been knocked about a bit,
p27
aVwhich is not surprising
p28
aVbecause it was made two and a half thousand years ago
p29
aVand was dug up
p30
aVin 1879.
p31
aVBut today,
p32
aVthis thing is, I believe,
p33
aVa major player
p34
aVin the politics of the Middle East.
p35
aVAnd it's an object
p36
aVwith fascinating stories
p37
aVand stories that are by no means over yet.
p38
aa(lp39
VThe story begins
p40
aVin the Iran-Iraq war
p41
aVand that series of events
p42
aVthat culminated
p43
aVin the invasion of Iraq
p44
aVby foreign forces,
p45
aVthe removal of a despotic ruler
p46
aVand instant regime change.
p47
aVAnd I want to begin
p48
aVwith one episode from that sequence of events
p49
aVthat most of you would be very familiar with,
p50
aVBelshazzar's feast \u2014
p51
aVbecause we're talking about the Iran-Iraq war
p52
aVof 539 BC.
p53
aVAnd the parallels
p54
aVbetween the events
p55
aVof 539 BC and 2003 and in between
p56
aVare startling.
p57
aVWhat you're looking at is Rembrandt's painting,
p58
aVnow in the National Gallery in London,
p59
aVillustrating the text from the prophet Daniel
p60
aVin the Hebrew scriptures.
p61
aVAnd you all know roughly the story.
p62
aa(lp63
VBelshazzar, the son of Nebuchadnezzar,
p64
aVNebuchadnezzar who'd conquered Israel, sacked Jerusalem
p65
aVand captured the people
p66
aVand taken the Jews back to Babylon.
p67
aVNot only the Jews, he'd taken the temple vessels.
p68
aVHe'd ransacked, desecrated the temple.
p69
aVAnd the great gold vessels of the temple in Jerusalem
p70
aVhad been taken to Babylon.
p71
aVBelshazzar, his son,
p72
aVdecides to have a feast.
p73
aVAnd in order to make it even more exciting,
p74
aVhe added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun,
p75
aVand he brings out the temple vessels.
p76
aVHe's already at war with the Iranians,
p77
aVwith the king of Persia.
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd that night, Daniel tells us,
p80
aVat the height of the festivities
p81
aVa hand appeared and wrote on the wall,
p82
aV"You are weighed in the balance and found wanting,
p83
aVand your kingdom is handed over
p84
aVto the Medes and the Persians."
p85
aVAnd that very night
p86
aVCyrus, king of the Persians, entered Babylon
p87
aVand the whole regime of Belshazzar fell.
p88
aVIt is, of course, a great moment
p89
aVin the history
p90
aVof the Jewish people.
p91
aVIt's a great story. It's story we all know.
p92
aV"The writing on the wall"
p93
aVis part of our everyday language.
p94
aVWhat happened next
p95
aVwas remarkable,
p96
aVand it's where our cylinder
p97
aVenters the story.
p98
aa(lp99
VCyrus, king of the Persians,
p100
aVhas entered Babylon without a fight \u2014
p101
aVthe great empire of Babylon,
p102
aVwhich ran from central southern Iraq
p103
aVto the Mediterranean,
p104
aVfalls to Cyrus.
p105
aVAnd Cyrus makes a declaration.
p106
aVAnd that is what this cylinder is,
p107
aVthe declaration made by the ruler guided by God
p108
aVwho had toppled the Iraqi despot
p109
aVand was going to bring freedom to the people.
p110
aVIn ringing Babylonian \u2014
p111
aVit was written in Babylonian \u2014
p112
aVhe says, "I am Cyrus, king of all the universe,
p113
aVthe great king, the powerful king,
p114
aVking of Babylon, king of the four quarters of the world."
p115
aVThey're not shy of hyperbole as you can see.
p116
aVThis is probably
p117
aVthe first real press release
p118
aVby a victorious army
p119
aVthat we've got.
p120
aVAnd it's written, as we'll see in due course,
p121
aVby very skilled P.R. consultants.
p122
aVSo the hyperbole is not actually surprising.
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd what is the great king, the powerful king,
p125
aVthe king of the four quarters of the world going to do?
p126
aVHe goes on to say that, having conquered Babylon,
p127
aVhe will at once let all the peoples
p128
aVthat the Babylonians \u2014 Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar \u2014
p129
aVhave captured and enslaved
p130
aVgo free.
p131
aVHe'll let them return to their countries.
p132
aVAnd more important,
p133
aVhe will let them all recover
p134
aVthe gods, the statues,
p135
aVthe temple vessels
p136
aVthat had been confiscated.
p137
aVAll the peoples that the Babylonians had repressed and removed
p138
aVwill go home,
p139
aVand they'll take with them their gods.
p140
aVAnd they'll be able to restore their altars
p141
aVand to worship their gods
p142
aVin their own way, in their own place.
p143
aVThis is the decree,
p144
aVthis object is the evidence
p145
aVfor the fact that the Jews,
p146
aVafter the exile in Babylon,
p147
aVthe years they'd spent sitting by the waters of Babylon,
p148
aVweeping when they remembered Jerusalem,
p149
aVthose Jews were allowed to go home.
p150
aVThey were allowed to return to Jerusalem
p151
aVand to rebuild the temple.
p152
aa(lp153
VIt's a central document
p154
aVin Jewish history.
p155
aVAnd the Book of Chronicles, the Book of Ezra in the Hebrew scriptures
p156
aVreported in ringing terms.
p157
aVThis is the Jewish version
p158
aVof the same story.
p159
aV"Thus said Cyrus, king of Persia,
p160
aV'All the kingdoms of the earth have the Lord God of heaven given thee,
p161
aVand he has charged me
p162
aVto build him a house in Jerusalem.
p163
aVWho is there among you of his people?
p164
aVThe Lord God be with him,
p165
aVand let him go up.'"
p166
aV"Go up" \u2014 aaleh.
p167
aVThe central element, still,
p168
aVof the notion of return,
p169
aVa central part
p170
aVof the life of Judaism.
p171
aVAs you all know, that return from exile,
p172
aVthe second temple,
p173
aVreshaped Judaism.
p174
aVAnd that change,
p175
aVthat great historic moment,
p176
aVwas made possible by Cyrus, the king of Persia,
p177
aVreported for us in Hebrew in scripture
p178
aVand in Babylonian in clay.
p179
aa(lp180
VTwo great texts,
p181
aVwhat about the politics?
p182
aVWhat was going on
p183
aVwas the fundamental shift in Middle Eastern history.
p184
aVThe empire of Iran, the Medes and the Persians,
p185
aVunited under Cyrus,
p186
aVbecame the first great world empire.
p187
aVCyrus begins in the 530s BC.
p188
aVAnd by the time of his son Darius,
p189
aVthe whole of the eastern Mediterranean
p190
aVis under Persian control.
p191
aVThis empire is, in fact,
p192
aVthe Middle East as we now know it,
p193
aVand it's what shapes the Middle East as we now know it.
p194
aVIt was the largest empire the world had known until then.
p195
aVMuch more important,
p196
aVit was the first
p197
aVmulticultural, multifaith state
p198
aVon a huge scale.
p199
aVAnd it had to be run in a quite new way.
p200
aVIt had to be run in different languages.
p201
aVThe fact that this decree is in Babylonian says one thing.
p202
aVAnd it had to recognize their different habits,
p203
aVdifferent peoples, different religions, different faiths.
p204
aVAll of those are respected by Cyrus.
p205
aa(lp206
VCyrus sets up a model
p207
aVof how you run
p208
aVa great multinational, multifaith, multicultural society.
p209
aVAnd the result of that
p210
aVwas an empire that included the areas you see on the screen,
p211
aVand which survived for 200 years of stability
p212
aVuntil it was shattered by Alexander.
p213
aVIt left a dream of the Middle East as a unit,
p214
aVand a unit where people of different faiths
p215
aVcould live together.
p216
aVThe Greek invasions ended that.
p217
aVAnd of course, Alexander couldn't sustain a government
p218
aVand it fragmented.
p219
aVBut what Cyrus represented
p220
aVremained absolutely central.
p221
aa(lp222
VThe Greek historian Xenophon
p223
aVwrote his book "Cyropaedia"
p224
aVpromoting Cyrus as the great ruler.
p225
aVAnd throughout European culture afterward,
p226
aVCyrus remained the model.
p227
aVThis is a 16th century image
p228
aVto show you how widespread
p229
aVhis veneration actually was.
p230
aVAnd Xenophon's book on Cyrus
p231
aVon how you ran a diverse society
p232
aVwas one of the great textbooks
p233
aVthat inspired the Founding Fathers
p234
aVof the American Revolution.
p235
aVJefferson was a great admirer \u2014
p236
aVthe ideals of Cyrus
p237
aVobviously speaking to those 18th century ideals
p238
aVof how you create religious tolerance
p239
aVin a new state.
p240
aa(lp241
VMeanwhile, back in Babylon,
p242
aVthings had not been going well.
p243
aVAfter Alexander, the other empires,
p244
aVBabylon declines, falls into ruins,
p245
aVand all the traces of the great Babylonian empire are lost \u2014
p246
aVuntil 1879
p247
aVwhen the cylinder is discovered
p248
aVby a British Museum exhibition digging in Babylon.
p249
aVAnd it enters now another story.
p250
aVIt enters that great debate
p251
aVin the middle of the 19th century:
p252
aVAre the scriptures reliable? Can we trust them?
p253
aVWe only knew
p254
aVabout the return of the Jews and the decree of Cyrus
p255
aVfrom the Hebrew scriptures.
p256
aVNo other evidence.
p257
aVSuddenly, this appeared.
p258
aVAnd great excitement
p259
aVto a world where those who believed in the scriptures
p260
aVhad had their faith in creation shaken
p261
aVby evolution, by geology,
p262
aVhere was evidence
p263
aVthat the scriptures were historically true.
p264
aVIt's a great 19th century moment.
p265
aa(lp266
VBut \u2014 and this, of course, is where it becomes complicated \u2014
p267
aVthe facts were true,
p268
aVhurrah for archeology,
p269
aVbut the interpretation was rather more complicated.
p270
aVBecause the cylinder account and the Hebrew Bible account
p271
aVdiffer in one key respect.
p272
aVThe Babylonian cylinder
p273
aVis written by the priests
p274
aVof the great god of Bablyon, Marduk.
p275
aVAnd, not surprisingly,
p276
aVthey tell you that all this was done by Marduk.
p277
aV"Marduk, we hold, called Cyrus by his name."
p278
aVMarduk takes Cyrus by the hand,
p279
aVcalls him to shepherd his people
p280
aVand gives him the rule of Babylon.
p281
aVMarduk tells Cyrus
p282
aVthat he will do these great, generous things
p283
aVof setting the people free.
p284
aVAnd this is why we should all be grateful to
p285
aVand worship Marduk.
p286
aa(lp287
VThe Hebrew writers
p288
aVin the Old Testament,
p289
aVyou will not be surprised to learn,
p290
aVtake a rather different view of this.
p291
aVFor them, of course, it can't possibly by Marduk
p292
aVthat made all this happen.
p293
aVIt can only be Jehovah.
p294
aVAnd so in Isaiah,
p295
aVwe have the wonderful texts
p296
aVgiving all the credit of this,
p297
aVnot to Marduk
p298
aVbut to the Lord God of Israel \u2014
p299
aVthe Lord God of Israel
p300
aVwho also called Cyrus by name,
p301
aValso takes Cyrus by the hand
p302
aVand talks of him shepherding his people.
p303
aVIt's a remarkable example
p304
aVof two different priestly appropriations of the same event,
p305
aVtwo different religious takeovers
p306
aVof a political fact.
p307
aa(lp308
VGod, we know,
p309
aVis usually on the side of the big battalions.
p310
aVThe question is, which god was it?
p311
aVAnd the debate unsettles
p312
aVeverybody in the 19th century
p313
aVto realize that the Hebrew scriptures
p314
aVare part of a much wider world of religion.
p315
aVAnd it's quite clear
p316
aVthe cylinder is older than the text of Isaiah,
p317
aVand yet, Jehovah is speaking
p318
aVin words very similar
p319
aVto those used by Marduk.
p320
aVAnd there's a slight sense that Isaiah knows this,
p321
aVbecause he says,
p322
aVthis is God speaking, of course,
p323
aV"I have called thee by thy name
p324
aVthough thou hast not known me."
p325
aVI think it's recognized
p326
aVthat Cyrus doesn't realize
p327
aVthat he's acting under orders from Jehovah.
p328
aVAnd equally, he'd have been surprised that he was acting under orders from Marduk.
p329
aVBecause interestingly, of course,
p330
aVCyrus is a good Iranian
p331
aVwith a totally different set of gods
p332
aVwho are not mentioned in any of these texts.
p333
aa(lp334
V(Laughter)
p335
aa(lp336
VThat's 1879.
p337
aV40 years on
p338
aVand we're in 1917,
p339
aVand the cylinder enters a different world.
p340
aVThis time, the real politics
p341
aVof the contemporary world \u2014
p342
aVthe year of the Balfour Declaration,
p343
aVthe year when the new imperial power in the Middle East, Britain,
p344
aVdecides that it will declare
p345
aVa Jewish national home,
p346
aVit will allow
p347
aVthe Jews to return.
p348
aVAnd the response to this
p349
aVby the Jewish population in Eastern Europe is rhapsodic.
p350
aVAnd across Eastern Europe,
p351
aVJews display pictures of Cyrus
p352
aVand of George V
p353
aVside by side \u2014
p354
aVthe two great rulers
p355
aVwho have allowed the return to Jerusalem.
p356
aVAnd the Cyrus cylinder comes back into public view
p357
aVand the text of this
p358
aVas a demonstration of why what is going to happen
p359
aVafter the war is over in 1918
p360
aVis part of a divine plan.
p361
aVYou all know what happened.
p362
aVThe state of Israel is setup,
p363
aVand 50 years later, in the late 60s,
p364
aVit's clear that Britain's role as the imperial power is over.
p365
aVAnd another story of the cylinder begins.
p366
aa(lp367
VThe region, the U.K. and the U.S. decide,
p368
aVhas to be kept safe from communism,
p369
aVand the superpower that will be created to do this
p370
aVwould be Iran, the Shah.
p371
aVAnd so the Shah invents an Iranian history,
p372
aVor a return to Iranian history,
p373
aVthat puts him in the center of a great tradition
p374
aVand produces coins
p375
aVshowing himself
p376
aVwith the Cyrus cylinder.
p377
aVWhen he has his great celebrations in Persepolis,
p378
aVhe summons the cylinder
p379
aVand the cylinder is lent by the British Museum, goes to Tehran,
p380
aVand is part of those great celebrations
p381
aVof the Pahlavi dynasty.
p382
aVCyrus cylinder: guarantor of the Shah.
p383
aa(lp384
V10 years later, another story:
p385
aVIranian Revolution, 1979.
p386
aVIslamic revolution, no more Cyrus;
p387
aVwe're not interested in that history,
p388
aVwe're interested in Islamic Iran \u2014
p389
aVuntil Iraq,
p390
aVthe new superpower that we've all decided should be in the region,
p391
aVattacks.
p392
aVThen another Iran-Iraq war.
p393
aVAnd it becomes critical for the Iranians
p394
aVto remember their great past,
p395
aVtheir great past
p396
aVwhen they fought Iraq and won.
p397
aVIt becomes critical to find a symbol
p398
aVthat will pull together all Iranians \u2014
p399
aVMuslims and non-Muslims,
p400
aVChristians, Zoroastrians, Jews living in Iran,
p401
aVpeople who are devout, not devout.
p402
aVAnd the obvious emblem is Cyrus.
p403
aa(lp404
VSo when the British Museum and Tehran National Musuem
p405
aVcooperate and work together, as we've been doing,
p406
aVthe Iranians ask for one thing only
p407
aVas a loan.
p408
aVIt's the only object they want.
p409
aVThey want to borrow the Cyrus cylinder.
p410
aVAnd last year,
p411
aVthe Cyrus cylinder went to Tehran
p412
aVfor the second time.
p413
aVIt's shown being presented here, put into its case
p414
aVby the director of the National Museum of Tehran,
p415
aVone of the many women in Iran in very senior positions,
p416
aVMrs. Ardakani.
p417
aVIt was a huge event.
p418
aVThis is the other side of that same picture.
p419
aVIt's seen in Tehran
p420
aVby between one and two million people
p421
aVin the space of a few months.
p422
aVThis is beyond any blockbuster exhibition
p423
aVin the West.
p424
aVAnd it's the subject of a huge debate
p425
aVabout what this cylinder means, what Cyrus means,
p426
aVbut above all, Cyrus as articulated through this cylinder \u2014
p427
aVCyrus as the defender of the homeland,
p428
aVthe champion, of course, of Iranian identity
p429
aVand of the Iranian peoples,
p430
aVtolerant of all faiths.
p431
aVAnd in the current Iran,
p432
aVZoroastrians and Christians have guaranteed places
p433
aVin the Iranian parliament, something to be very, very proud of.
p434
aa(lp435
VTo see this object in Tehran,
p436
aVthousands of Jews living in Iran
p437
aVcame to Tehran to see it.
p438
aVIt became a great emblem,
p439
aVa great subject of debate
p440
aVabout what Iran is at home and abroad.
p441
aVIs Iran still to be the defender of the oppressed?
p442
aVWill Iran set free the people
p443
aVthat the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated?
p444
aVThis is heady national rhetoric,
p445
aVand it was all put together
p446
aVin a great pageant
p447
aVlaunching the return.
p448
aVHere you see this out-sized Cyrus cylinder on the stage
p449
aVwith great figures from Iranian history
p450
aVgathering to take their place
p451
aVin the heritage of Iran.
p452
aVIt was a narrative presented
p453
aVby the president himself.
p454
aa(lp455
VAnd for me,
p456
aVto take this object to Iran,
p457
aVto be allowed to take this object to Iran
p458
aVwas to be allowed to be part
p459
aVof an extraordinary debate
p460
aVled at the highest levels
p461
aVabout what Iran is,
p462
aVwhat different Irans there are
p463
aVand how the different histories of Iran
p464
aVmight shape the world today.
p465
aVIt's a debate that's still continuing,
p466
aVand it will continue to rumble,
p467
aVbecause this object
p468
aVis one of the great declarations
p469
aVof a human aspiration.
p470
aVIt stands with the American constitution.
p471
aVIt certainly says far more about real freedoms
p472
aVthan Magna Carta.
p473
aVIt is a document that can mean so many things,
p474
aVfor Iran and for the region.
p475
aa(lp476
VA replica of this
p477
aVis at the United Nations.
p478
aVIn New York this autumn, it will be present
p479
aVwhen the great debates
p480
aVabout the future of the Middle East take place.
p481
aVAnd I want to finish by asking you
p482
aVwhat the next story will be
p483
aVin which this object figures.
p484
aVIt will appear, certainly,
p485
aVin many more Middle Eastern stories.
p486
aVAnd what story of the Middle East,
p487
aVwhat story of the world,
p488
aVdo you want to see
p489
aVreflecting what is said,
p490
aVwhat is expressed in this cylinder?
p491
aVThe right of peoples
p492
aVto live together in the same state,
p493

VAllison Hunt: My three minutes hasn't started yet, has it?
p5
aa(lp6
VChris Anderson: No, you can't start the three minutes.
p7
aVReset the three minutes, that's just not fair.
p8
aa(lp9
VAH: Oh my God, it's harsh up here.
p10
aVI mean I'm nervous enough as it is.
p11
aa(lp12
VBut I am not as nervous as I was five weeks ago.
p13
aVFive weeks ago I had total hip replacement surgery.
p14
aVDo you know that surgery?
p15
aVElectric saw, power drill, totally disgusting
p16
aVunless you're David Bolinsky, in which case it's all truth and beauty.
p17
aVSure David, if it's not your hip, it's truth and beauty.
p18
aa(lp19
VAnyway, I did have a really big epiphany around the situation,
p20
aVso Chris invited me to tell you about it.
p21
aVBut first you need to know two things about me.
p22
aVJust two things.
p23
aVI'm Canadian, and I'm the youngest of seven kids.
p24
aVNow, in Canada, we have that great healthcare system.
p25
aVThat means we get our new hips for free.
p26
aVAnd being the youngest of seven,
p27
aVI have never been at the front of the line for anything. OK?
p28
aa(lp29
VSo my hip had been hurting me for years.
p30
aVI finally went to the doctor, which was free.
p31
aVAnd she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon, also free.
p32
aVFinally got to see him after 10 months of waiting \u2014 almost a year.
p33
aVThat is what free gets you.
p34
aVI met the surgeon, and he took some free X-rays,
p35
aVand I got a good look at them. And you know,
p36
aVeven I could tell my hip was bad,
p37
aVand I actually work in marketing.
p38
aVSo he said, "Allison, we've got to get you on the table.
p39
aVI'm going to replace your hip \u2014 it's about an 18-month wait."
p40
aV18 more months.
p41
aVI'd already waited 10 months, and I had to wait 18 more months.
p42
aa(lp43
VYou know, it's such a long wait that I actually
p44
aVstarted to even think about it in terms of TEDs.
p45
aVI wouldn't have my new hip for this TED.
p46
aVI wouldn't have my new hip for TEDGlobal in Africa.
p47
aVI would not have my new hip for TED2008.
p48
aVI would still be on my bad hip. That was so disappointing.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo, I left his office and I was walking through the hospital,
p51
aVand that's when I had my epiphany.
p52
aVThis youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line.
p53
aVOh yeah.
p54
aa(lp55
VCan I tell you how un-Canadian that is?
p56
aVWe do not think that way.
p57
aVWe don't talk about it. It's not even a consideration.
p58
aVIn fact, when we're traveling abroad, it's how we identify fellow Canadians.
p59
aV"After you." "Oh, no, no. After you."
p60
aVHey, are you from Canada? "Oh, me too! Hi!"
p61
aV"Great! Excellent!"
p62
aa(lp63
VSo no, suddenly I wasn't averse to butting any geezer off the list.
p64
aVSome 70-year-old who wanted his new hip
p65
aVso he could be back golfing, or gardening.
p66
aVNo, no. Front of the line.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo by now I was walking the lobby, and of course, that hurt,
p69
aVbecause of my hip, and I kind of needed a sign.
p70
aVAnd I saw a sign.
p71
aVIn the window of the hospital's tiny gift shop there was a sign
p72
aVthat said, "Volunteers Needed." Hmm.
p73
aVWell, they signed me up immediately.
p74
aVNo reference checks. None of the usual background stuff, no.
p75
aVThey were desperate for volunteers
p76
aVbecause the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75.
p77
aVYeah. They needed some young blood.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo, next thing you know, I had my bright blue volunteer vest,
p80
aVI had my photo ID, and I was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss.
p81
aVI worked alone.
p82
aVEvery Friday morning I was at the gift shop.
p83
aVWhile ringing in hospital staff's Tic Tacs,
p84
aVI'd casually ask, "What do you do?"
p85
aVThen I'd tell them, "Well, I'm getting my hip replaced \u2014 in 18 months.
p86
aVIt's gonna be so great when the pain stops. Ow!"
p87
aVAll the staff got to know the plucky, young volunteer.
p88
aa(lp89
VMy next surgeon's appointment was, coincidentally,
p90
aVright after a shift at the gift shop.
p91
aVSo, naturally, I had my vest and my identification.
p92
aVI draped them casually over the chair in the doctor's office.
p93
aVAnd you know, when he walked in,
p94
aVI could just tell that he saw them.
p95
aVMoments later, I had a surgery date just weeks away,
p96
aVand a big fat prescription for Percocet.
p97
aa(lp98
VNow, word on the street was that it was actually
p99
aVmy volunteering that got me to the front of the line.
p100
aVAnd, you know, I'm not even ashamed of that.
p101
aVTwo reasons.
p102
aVFirst of all, I am going to take such good care of this new hip.
p103
aVBut also I intend to stick with the volunteering,
p104
aVwhich actually leads me to the biggest epiphany of them all.
p105
aVEven when a Canadian cheats the system,
p106
aVthey do it in a way that benefits society.

VI'm actually going to share something with you
p5
aVI haven't talked about probably in more than 10 years.
p6
aVSo bear with me as I take you through this journey.
p7
aVWhen I was 22 years old,
p8
aVI came home from work, put a leash on my dog
p9
aVand went for my usual run.
p10
aVI had no idea that at that moment,
p11
aVmy life was going to change forever.
p12
aVWhile I was preparing my dog for the run,
p13
aVa man was finishing drinking at a bar,
p14
aVpicked up his car keys, got into a car
p15
aVand headed south,
p16
aVor wherever he was.
p17
aVI was running across the street,
p18
aVand the only thing that I actually remember
p19
aVis feeling like a grenade went off in my head.
p20
aVAnd I remember putting my hands on the ground
p21
aVand feeling my life's blood
p22
aVemptying out of my neck and my mouth.
p23
aa(lp24
VWhat had happened is, he ran a red light
p25
aVand hit me and my dog.
p26
aVShe ended up underneath the car.
p27
aVI flew out in front of the car,
p28
aVand then he ran over my legs.
p29
aVMy left leg got caught up in the wheel well \u2014
p30
aVspun it around.
p31
aVThe bumper of the car hit my throat,
p32
aVslicing it open.
p33
aVI ended up with blunt chest trauma.
p34
aVYour aorta comes up behind your heart, it's your major artery \u2014
p35
aVand it was severed, so my blood was gurgling out of my mouth.
p36
aVIt foamed, and ... horrible things were happening to me.
p37
aVI had no idea what was going on,
p38
aVbut strangers intervened,
p39
aVkept my heart moving, beating.
p40
aVI say "moving," because it was quivering,
p41
aVand they were trying to put a beat back into it.
p42
aa(lp43
VSomebody was smart and put a Bic pen in my neck
p44
aVto open up my airway, so I could get some air in there.
p45
aVAnd my lung collapsed,
p46
aVso somebody cut me open and put a pen in there as well,
p47
aVto stop that catastrophic event from happening.
p48
aVSomehow I ended up at the hospital.
p49
aVI was wrapped in ice,
p50
aVand then eventually put into a drug-induced coma.
p51
aa(lp52
VEighteen months later, I woke up.
p53
aVI was blind, I couldn't speak
p54
aVand I couldn't walk.
p55
aVI was 64 pounds.
p56
aVThe hospital really has no idea what to do with people like that.
p57
aVAnd in fact, they started to call me a "gomer."
p58
aVThat's another story we won't even get into.
p59
aVI had so many surgeries to put my neck back together,
p60
aVto repair my heart a few times.
p61
aa(lp62
VSome things worked, some things didn't.
p63
aVI had lots of titanium put in me;
p64
aVcadaver bones,
p65
aVto try to get my feet moving the right way.
p66
aVAnd I ended up with a plastic nose,
p67
aVporcelain teeth and all kinds of other things.
p68
aVBut eventually, I started to look human again.
p69
aVBut ...
p70
aVIt's hard sometimes to talk about these things,
p71
aVso bear with me.
p72
aVI had more than 50 surgeries.
p73
aVBut who's counting?
p74
aa(lp75
V(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VSo eventually, the hospital decided it was time for me to go.
p78
aVThey needed to open up space for somebody else
p79
aVthat they thought could come back
p80
aVfrom whatever they were going through.
p81
aVEverybody lost faith in me being able to recover.
p82
aVSo they basically put a map up on the wall, threw a dart,
p83
aVand it landed at a senior home, here in Colorado.
p84
aVAnd I know all of you are scratching your head:
p85
aV"A senior citizens' home?
p86
aVWhat in the world are you going to do there?"
p87
aVBut if you think about all of the skills and talent
p88
aVthat are in this room right now,
p89
aVthat's what a senior home has.
p90
aVSo there were all these skills and talents
p91
aVthat these seniors had.
p92
aVThe one advantage they had over most of you
p93
aVis wisdom,
p94
aVbecause they had a long life.
p95
aVAnd I needed that wisdom at that moment in my life.
p96
aa(lp97
VBut imagine what it was like for them
p98
aVwhen I showed up at their doorstep.
p99
aVAt that point, I had gained four pounds, so I was 68 pounds.
p100
aVI was bald.
p101
aVI was wearing hospital scrubs.
p102
aVAnd somebody donated tennis shoes for me.
p103
aVAnd I had a white cane in one hand
p104
aVand a suitcase full of medical records in another hand.
p105
aVSo the senior citizens realized
p106
aVthat they needed to have an emergency meeting.
p107
aa(lp108
V(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VSo they pulled back and they were looking at each other,
p111
aVand they were going, "OK, what skills do we have in this room?
p112
aVThis kid needs a lot of work."
p113
aa(lp114
VSo they eventually started matching their talents and skills
p115
aVto all of my needs.
p116
aVBut one of the first things they needed to do
p117
aVwas assess what I needed right away.
p118
aVI needed to figure out how to eat like a normal human being,
p119
aVsince I'd been eating through a tube in my chest
p120
aVand through my veins.
p121
aVSo I had to go through trying to eat again.
p122
aVAnd they went through that process.
p123
aVAnd then they had to figure out:
p124
aV"Well, she needs furniture.
p125
aVShe is sleeping in the corner of this apartment."
p126
aVSo they went to their storage lockers
p127
aVand all gathered their extra furniture \u2014
p128
aVgave me pots and pans, blankets \u2014
p129
aVeverything.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd then the next thing that I needed
p132
aVwas a makeover.
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VSo out went the green scrubs,
p137
aVand in came the polyester and floral prints.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VWe're not going to talk about the hairstyles
p142
aVthey tried to force on me once my hair grew back.
p143
aVBut I did say no to the blue hair.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VSo eventually, what went on is,
p148
aVthey decided that, well, I need to learn to speak.
p149
aVYou can't be an independent person
p150
aVif you're not able to speak and you can't see.
p151
aVSo they figured not being able to see is one thing,
p152
aVbut they need to get me to talk.
p153
aVSo while Sally, the office manager,
p154
aVwas teaching me to speak in the day \u2014
p155
aVit's hard, because when you're a kid, you take things for granted.
p156
aVYou learn things unconsciously.
p157
aVBut for me, I was an adult and it was embarrassing,
p158
aVand I had to learn how to coordinate my new throat with my tongue
p159
aVand my new teeth and my lips,
p160
aVand capture the air and get the word out.
p161
aVSo, I acted like a two-year-old,
p162
aVand refused to work.
p163
aa(lp164
VBut the men had a better idea.
p165
aVThey were going to make it fun for me.
p166
aVSo they were teaching me cuss-word Scrabble at night.
p167
aa(lp168
V(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd then, secretly, how to swear like a sailor.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VI'm going to just leave it to your imagination
p175
aVas to what my first words were \u2014
p176
aa(lp177
V(Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
Vwhen Sally finally got my confidence built.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VSo I moved on from there.
p184
aVAnd a former teacher who happened to have Alzheimer's
p185
aVtook on the task of teaching me to write.
p186
aVThe redundancy was actually good for me.
p187
aVSo, we'll just keep moving on.
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VOne of the pivotal times for me
p192
aVwas actually learning to cross the street again
p193
aVas a blind person.
p194
aVSo close your eyes.
p195
aVNow imagine you have to cross a street.
p196
aVYou don't know how far that street is,
p197
aVand you don't know if you're going straight.
p198
aVAnd you hear cars whizzing back and forth,
p199
aVand you had a horrible accident
p200
aVthat landed you in this situation.
p201
aVSo there were two obstacles I had to get through.
p202
aVOne was post-traumatic stress disorder.
p203
aVEvery time I approached the corner or the curb,
p204
aVI would panic.
p205
aVAnd the second one
p206
aVwas actually trying to figure out how to cross that street.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo one of the seniors just came up to me,
p209
aVand she pushed me up to the corner and said,
p210
aV"When you think it's time to go, just stick the cane out there.
p211
aVIf it's hit, don't cross the street."
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
VMade perfect sense.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VBut by the third cane that went whizzing across the road \u2014
p220
aa(lp221
V(Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
Vthey realized that they needed to put their resources together,
p224
aVand they raised funds
p225
aVso that I could go to the Braille Institute
p226
aVand actually gain the skills to be a blind person,
p227
aVand also to go get a guide dog,
p228
aVwho transformed my life.
p229
aVAnd I was able to return to college
p230
aVbecause of the senior citizens who invested in me,
p231
aVand also the guide dog and skill set I had gained.
p232
aa(lp233
VTen years later, I gained my sight back.
p234
aVNot magically \u2014
p235
aVI opted in for three surgeries,
p236
aVand one of them was experimental.
p237
aVIt was actually robotic surgery
p238
aVthat removed a hematoma from behind my eye.
p239
aa(lp240
VThe biggest change for me was that the world moved forward,
p241
aVthat there were innovations and all kinds of new things \u2014
p242
aVcellphones, laptops,
p243
aVall these things that I had never seen before.
p244
aVAnd as a blind person,
p245
aVyour visual memory fades,
p246
aVand is replaced with how you feel about things
p247
aVand how things sound
p248
aVand how things smell.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo one day, I was in my room
p251
aVand I saw this thing sitting in my room.
p252
aVI thought it was a monster,
p253
aVso I was walking around it.
p254
aVAnd I go, "I'm just going to touch it."
p255
aVAnd I touched it and I went,
p256
aV"Oh my God, it's a laundry basket."
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
VEverything is different when you're a sighted person,
p261
aVbecause you take that for granted.
p262
aVBut when you're blind, you have the tactile memory for things.
p263
aa(lp264
VThe biggest change for me was looking down at my hands
p265
aVand seeing that I'd lost 10 years of my life.
p266
aVI thought that time had stood still for some reason
p267
aVand moved on for family and friends.
p268
aVBut when I looked down,
p269
aVI realized that time marched on for me, too,
p270
aVand that I needed to get caught up.
p271
aVSo I got going on it.
p272
aa(lp273
VWe didn't have words like "crowdsourcing" and "radical collaboration"
p274
aVwhen I had my accident.
p275
aVBut the concept held true \u2014
p276
aVpeople working with people to rebuild me;
p277
aVpeople working with people to reeducate me.
p278
aVI wouldn't be standing here today
p279
aVif it wasn't for extreme radical collaboration.
p280
aa(lp281
VThank you so much.
p282
aa(lp283
V(Applause)

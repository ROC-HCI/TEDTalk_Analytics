VI would like to tell you all
p5
aVthat you are all actually cyborgs,
p6
aVbut not the cyborgs that you think.
p7
aVYou're not RoboCop, and you're not Terminator,
p8
aVbut you're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen
p9
aVor use one of your cell phone devices.
p10
aVSo what's a good definition for cyborg?
p11
aVWell, traditional definition is "an organism
p12
aVto which exogenous components have been added
p13
aVfor the purpose of adapting to new environments."
p14
aVThat came from a 1960 paper on space travel,
p15
aVbecause, if you think about it, space is pretty awkward.
p16
aVPeople aren't supposed to be there.
p17
aVBut humans are curious, and they like to add things to their bodies
p18
aVso they can go to the Alps one day
p19
aVand then become a fish in the sea the next.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo let's look at the concept of traditional anthropology.
p22
aVSomebody goes to another country,
p23
aVsays, "How fascinating these people are, how interesting their tools are,
p24
aVhow curious their culture is."
p25
aVAnd then they write a paper, and maybe a few other anthropologists read it,
p26
aVand we think it's very exotic.
p27
aVWell, what's happening
p28
aVis that we've suddenly found a new species.
p29
aVI, as a cyborg anthropologist, have suddenly said,
p30
aV"Oh, wow. Now suddenly we're a new form of Homo sapiens,
p31
aVand look at these fascinating cultures,
p32
aVand look at these curious rituals
p33
aVthat everybody's doing around this technology.
p34
aVThey're clicking on things and staring at screens."
p35
aa(lp36
VNow there's a reason why I study this,
p37
aVversus traditional anthropology.
p38
aVAnd the reason is that tool use,
p39
aVin the beginning \u2014 for thousands and thousands of years,
p40
aVeverything has been a physical modification of self.
p41
aVIt has helped us to extend our physical selves,
p42
aVgo faster, hit things harder,
p43
aVand there's been a limit on that.
p44
aVBut now what we're looking at is not an extension of the physical self,
p45
aVbut an extension of the mental self,
p46
aVand because of that, we're able to travel faster,
p47
aVcommunicate differently.
p48
aVAnd the other thing that happens
p49
aVis that we're all carrying around little Mary Poppins technology.
p50
aVWe can put anything we want into it, and it doesn't get heavier,
p51
aVand then we can take anything out.
p52
aVWhat does the inside of your computer actually look like?
p53
aVWell, if you print it out, it looks like a thousand pounds of material
p54
aVthat you're carrying around all the time.
p55
aVAnd if you actually lose that information,
p56
aVit means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind,
p57
aVthat you suddenly feel like something's missing,
p58
aVexcept you aren't able to see it, so it feels like a very strange emotion.
p59
aa(lp60
VThe other thing that happens is that you have a second self.
p61
aVWhether you like it or not, you're starting to show up online,
p62
aVand people are interacting with your second self
p63
aVwhen you're not there.
p64
aVAnd so you have to be careful
p65
aVabout leaving your front lawn open,
p66
aVwhich is basically your Facebook wall,
p67
aVso that people don't write on it in the middle of the night \u2014
p68
aVbecause it's very much the equivalent.
p69
aVAnd suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self.
p70
aVYou have to present yourself in digital life
p71
aVin a similar way that you would in your analog life.
p72
aVSo, in the same way that you wake up, take a shower and get dressed,
p73
aVyou have to learn to do that for your digital self.
p74
aVAnd the problem is that a lot of people now,
p75
aVespecially adolescents,
p76
aVhave to go through two adolescences.
p77
aVThey have to go through their primary one, that's already awkward,
p78
aVand then they go through their second self's adolescence,
p79
aVand that's even more awkward
p80
aVbecause there's an actual history
p81
aVof what they've gone through online.
p82
aVAnd anybody coming in new to technology
p83
aVis an adolescent online right now,
p84
aVand so it's very awkward,
p85
aVand it's very difficult for them to do those things.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo when I was little, my dad would sit me down at night and he would say,
p88
aV"I'm going to teach you about time and space in the future."
p89
aVAnd I said, "Great."
p90
aVAnd he said one day, "What's the shortest distance between two points?"
p91
aVAnd I said, "Well, that's a straight line. You told me that yesterday."
p92
aVI thought I was very clever.
p93
aVHe said, "No, no, no. Here's a better way."
p94
aVHe took a piece of paper,
p95
aVdrew A and B on one side and the other
p96
aVand folded them together so where A and B touched.
p97
aVAnd he said, "That is the shortest distance between two points."
p98
aVAnd I said, "Dad, dad, dad, how do you do that?"
p99
aVHe said, "Well, you just bend time and space,
p100
aVit takes an awful lot of energy,
p101
aVand that's just how you do it."
p102
aVAnd I said, "I want to do that."
p103
aVAnd he said, "Well, okay."
p104
aVAnd so, when I went to sleep for the next 10 or 20 years,
p105
aVI was thinking at night,
p106
aV"I want to be the first person to create a wormhole,
p107
aVto make things accelerate faster.
p108
aVAnd I want to make a time machine."
p109
aVI was always sending messages to my future self
p110
aVusing tape recorders.
p111
aa(lp112
VBut then what I realized when I went to college
p113
aVis that technology doesn't just get adopted
p114
aVbecause it works.
p115
aVIt gets adopted because people use it
p116
aVand it's made for humans.
p117
aVSo I started studying anthropology.
p118
aVAnd when I was writing my thesis on cell phones,
p119
aVI realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets.
p120
aVThey weren't physically transporting themselves;
p121
aVthey were mentally transporting themselves.
p122
aVThey would click on a button,
p123
aVand they would be connected as A to B immediately.
p124
aVAnd I thought, "Oh, wow. I found it. This is great."
p125
aa(lp126
VSo over time, time and space
p127
aVhave compressed because of this.
p128
aVYou can stand on one side of the world,
p129
aVwhisper something and be heard on the other.
p130
aVOne of the other ideas that comes around
p131
aVis that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use.
p132
aVEvery single browser tab gives you a different type of time.
p133
aVAnd because of that, you start to dig around
p134
aVfor your external memories \u2014 where did you leave them?
p135
aVSo now we're all these paleontologists
p136
aVthat are digging for things that we've lost
p137
aVon our external brains that we're carrying around in our pockets.
p138
aVAnd that incites a sort of panic architecture \u2014
p139
aV"Oh no, where's this thing?"
p140
aVWe're all "I Love Lucy" on a great assembly line of information,
p141
aVand we can't keep up.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd so what happens is,
p144
aVwhen we bring all that into the social space,
p145
aVwe end up checking our phones all the time.
p146
aVSo we have this thing called ambient intimacy.
p147
aVIt's not that we're always connected to everybody,
p148
aVbut at anytime we can connect to anyone we want.
p149
aVAnd if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone,
p150
aVthe room would be very crowded.
p151
aVThese are the people that you have access to right now, in general \u2014
p152
aVall of these people, all of your friends and family that you can connect to.
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd so there are some psychological effects that happen with this.
p155
aVOne I'm really worried about
p156
aVis that people aren't taking time for mental reflection anymore,
p157
aVand that they aren't slowing down and stopping,
p158
aVbeing around all those people in the room all the time
p159
aVthat are trying to compete for their attention
p160
aVon the simultaneous time interfaces,
p161
aVpaleontology and panic architecture.
p162
aVThey're not just sitting there.
p163
aVAnd really, when you have no external input,
p164
aVthat is a time when there is a creation of self,
p165
aVwhen you can do long-term planning,
p166
aVwhen you can try and figure out who you really are.
p167
aVAnd then, once you do that, you can figure out
p168
aVhow to present your second self in a legitimate way,
p169
aVinstead of just dealing with everything as it comes in \u2014
p170
aVand oh, I have to do this, and I have to do this, and I have to do this.
p171
aVAnd so this is very important.
p172
aVI'm really worried that, especially kids today,
p173
aVthey're not going to be dealing with this down-time,
p174
aVthat they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture,
p175
aVand that everything comes to them,
p176
aVand that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it.
p177
aa(lp178
VSo if you think about it, the world hasn't stopped either.
p179
aVIt has its own external prosthetic devices,
p180
aVand these devices are helping us all
p181
aVto communicate and interact with each other.
p182
aVBut when you actually visualize it,
p183
aVall the connections that we're doing right now \u2014
p184
aVthis is an image of the mapping of the Internet \u2014
p185
aVit doesn't look technological.
p186
aVIt actually looks very organic.
p187
aVThis is the first time in the entire history of humanity
p188
aVthat we've connected in this way.
p189
aVAnd it's not that machines are taking over.
p190
aVIt's that they're helping us to be more human,
p191
aVhelping us to connect with each other.
p192
aa(lp193
VThe most successful technology gets out of the way
p194
aVand helps us live our lives.
p195
aVAnd really,
p196
aVit ends up being more human than technology,
p197
aVbecause we're co-creating each other all the time.
p198
aVAnd so this is the important point that I like to study:
p199
aVthat things are beautiful, that it's still a human connection \u2014
p200
aVit's just done in a different way.
p201
aVWe're just increasing our humanness
p202
aVand our ability to connect with each other, regardless of geography.
p203
aVSo that's why I study cyborg anthropology.
p204
aa(lp205
VThank you.

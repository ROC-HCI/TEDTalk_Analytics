VI was informed by this kind of
p5
aVunoriginal and trite idea
p6
aVthat new technologies were an opportunity
p7
aVfor social transformation,
p8
aVwhich is what drove me then,
p9
aVand still, it's a delusion that drives me now.
p10
aVI wanted to update what I've been doing since then \u2014
p11
aVbut it's still the same theme song \u2014
p12
aVand introduce you to my lab and current work,
p13
aVwhich is the Environmental Health Clinic
p14
aVthat I run at NYU.
p15
aVAnd what it is \u2014 it's a twist on health.
p16
aVBecause, really, what I'm trying to do now
p17
aVis redefine what counts as health.
p18
aVIt's a clinic like a health clinic at any other university,
p19
aVexcept people come to the clinic
p20
aVwith environmental health concerns,
p21
aVand they walk out with prescriptions
p22
aVfor things they can do to improve environmental health,
p23
aVas opposed to coming to a clinic with medical concerns
p24
aVand walking out with prescriptions for pharmaceuticals.
p25
aa(lp26
VIt's a handy-dandy quote from Hippocrates of the Hippocratic oath
p27
aVthat says, "The greater part of the soul lays outside the body,
p28
aVtreatment of the inner requires treatment of the outer."
p29
aVBut that suggests the issue
p30
aVthat I'm trying to get at here,
p31
aVthat we have an opportunity to redefine what is health.
p32
aVBecause this idea that health is internal
p33
aVand atomized and individual
p34
aVand pharmaceutical
p35
aVis largely an error.
p36
aVAnd I would use this study,
p37
aVa recent study by Philip Landrigan,
p38
aVto motivate a different view of health,
p39
aVwhere he went to most of the pediatricians in Manhattan
p40
aVand the New York area
p41
aVand logged what they spent their patient hours on.
p42
aV80 to 90 percent of their time
p43
aVwas spent on five things.
p44
aVNumber one was asthma,
p45
aVnumber two was developmental delays,
p46
aVnumber three was 400-fold increases
p47
aVin rare childhood cancers
p48
aVin the last eight to 10, 15 years.
p49
aVNumber four and five were childhood obesity
p50
aVand diabetes-related issues.
p51
aVSo all of those \u2014 what's common about all of those?
p52
aVThe environment is implicated, radically implicated, right.
p53
aVThis is not the germs
p54
aVthat medicos were trained to deal with;
p55
aVthis is a different definition of health,
p56
aVhealth that has a great advantage
p57
aVbecause it's external, it's shared,
p58
aVwe can do something about it,
p59
aVas opposed to internal, genetically predetermined
p60
aVor individualized.
p61
aa(lp62
VPeople who come to the clinic are called, not patients,
p63
aVbut impatients,
p64
aVbecause they're too impatient to wait for legislative change
p65
aVto address local and environmental health issues.
p66
aVAnd I meet them at the University, I also have a few field offices
p67
aVthat I set up in various places
p68
aVthat provide an immersion
p69
aVin some of the environmental challenges we face.
p70
aVI like this one from the Belgian field office,
p71
aVwhere we met in a roundabout,
p72
aVprecisely because the roundabout iconified
p73
aVthe headless social movement
p74
aVthat informs much social transformation,
p75
aVas opposed to the top-down control
p76
aVof red light traffic intersections.
p77
aVIn this case, of course, the roundabout
p78
aVwith that micro-decisions being made in situ
p79
aVby people not being told what to do.
p80
aVBut, of course, affords greater throughput,
p81
aVfewer accidents,
p82
aVand an interesting model of social movement.
p83
aa(lp84
VSome of the things that the monitoring protocols have developed:
p85
aVthis is the tadpole bureaucrat protocol,
p86
aVor keeping tabs, if you will.
p87
aVWhat they are is an addition of tadpoles
p88
aVthat are named after a local bureaucrat
p89
aVwhose decisions affect your water quality.
p90
aVSo an impatient concerned for water quality
p91
aVwould raise a tadpole bureaucrat
p92
aVin a sample of water in which they're interested.
p93
aVAnd we give them a couple of things to do that,
p94
aVto help them do companion animal devices
p95
aVwhile they're blogging and doing their email.
p96
aVThis is a tadpole walker
p97
aVto take your tadpole walking in the evening.
p98
aVAnd the interesting thing that happens \u2014
p99
aVbecause we're using tadpoles, of course,
p100
aVbecause they have the most exquisite biosenses that we have,
p101
aVseveral orders of magnitude more sensitive
p102
aVthan some of our senses
p103
aVfor sensing,
p104
aVresponding in a biologically meaningful way,
p105
aVto that whole class of industrial contaminants
p106
aVwe call endocrine disruptors
p107
aVor hormone emulators.
p108
aa(lp109
VBut by taking your tadpole out for a walk in the evening \u2014
p110
aVthere's a few action shots \u2014
p111
aVyour neighbors are likely to say, "What are you doing?"
p112
aVAnd then you have to introduce your tadpole
p113
aVand who it's named after.
p114
aVYou have to explain what you're doing
p115
aVand how the developmental events of a tadpole
p116
aVare, of course, very observable
p117
aVand they use the same T3-mediated hormones that we do.
p118
aVAnd so next time your neighbor sees you
p119
aVthey'll say, "How is that tadpole doing?"
p120
aVAnd you can let them social network with your tadpole,
p121
aVbecause the Environmental Health Clinic has a social networking site
p122
aVfor, not only impatients, humans,
p123
aVbut non-humans,
p124
aVsocial networking for humans and non-humans.
p125
aVAnd of course, these endocrine disruptors
p126
aVare things that are implicated in the breast cancer epidemic,
p127
aVthe obesity epidemic,
p128
aVthe two and a half year drop in the average age of onset of puberty in young girls
p129
aVand other related things.
p130
aVThe culmination of this is if you've successfully raised your tadpole,
p131
aVobserving the behavioral
p132
aVand developmental events,
p133
aVyou will then go and introduce your tadpole
p134
aVto its namesake
p135
aVand discuss the evidence that you've seen.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnother quick protocol \u2014 and I'm going to go through these quickly,
p138
aVbut just to give you the material sense of what we're doing here \u2014
p139
aVinstead of asking you for urine samples,
p140
aVI'll ask you for a mouse sample.
p141
aVAnyone here lucky enough to share, to cohabit with a mouse \u2014
p142
aVa domestic partnership with mice?
p143
aVVery lucky.
p144
aVMice, of course, are the quintessential
p145
aVmodel organism.
p146
aVThey're even better models of environmental health,
p147
aVbecause not only the same mammalian biology,
p148
aVbut they share your diet, largely.
p149
aVThey share your environmental stressors,
p150
aVthe asbestos levels and lead levels,
p151
aVwhatever you're exposed to.
p152
aVAnd they're geographically more limited than you are,
p153
aVbecause we don't know if you've been exposed
p154
aVto persistent organic pollutants
p155
aVin your home, or occupationally
p156
aVor as a child.
p157
aVMice are a very good representation.
p158
aVSo it starts by building a better mousetrap, of course.
p159
aVThis is one of them.
p160
aa(lp161
VCoping with environmental stressors is tricky.
p162
aVIs anybody here on antidepressants?
p163
aV(Laughter)
p164
aVThere's a lot of people in Manhattan are.
p165
aVAnd we were testing if the mice
p166
aVwould also self-administer SSRIs.
p167
aVSo this was Prozac, this was Zoloft,
p168
aVthis was a black jellybean and this was muscle relaxant,
p169
aVall of which were the medications that the impatient was taking.
p170
aVSo do you think the mice
p171
aVself-administered antidepressants?
p172
aVWhat's the \u2014 (Audience: Sure. Yes.)
p173
aVHow did you know that? They did.
p174
aVThis was vodka and solution, gin and solution.
p175
aVThis guy also liked plain water and the muscle relaxant.
p176
aVWhere's our expert?
p177
aVVodka, gin \u2014
p178
aV(Audience: [unclear])
p179
aVYes. Yes. You know your mice well.
p180
aVThey did, yes.
p181
aVSo they drank as much vodka as they did plain water,
p182
aVwhich was interesting.
p183
aVThen of course, it goes into the entrapment device.
p184
aVThere's an old cellphone in there \u2014 a good use for old cellphones \u2014
p185
aVwhich dials the clinic, we go and pick up the mouse.
p186
aVWe take the blood sample
p187
aVand do the blood work and hair work on the mice.
p188
aa(lp189
VAnd I want to sort of point out the big advantage
p190
aVof framing health in this external way.
p191
aVBut we do have a few prescription products through this.
p192
aVIt's very different from the medical model.
p193
aVAnything you do to improve your water quality or air quality,
p194
aVor to understand it or to change it,
p195
aVthe benefits are enjoyed by anyone
p196
aVyou share that water quality or air quality with.
p197
aVAnd that aggregating effect,
p198
aVthat collective action effect,
p199
aVis actually something we can use to our advantage.
p200
aVSo I want to show you one prescription product in the clinic
p201
aVcalled the No Park.
p202
aVThis is a prescription to improve water quality.
p203
aVMany impatients are very concerned for water quality and air quality.
p204
aVWhat we do is we take a fire hydrant,
p205
aVa "no parking" space associated with a fire hydrant,
p206
aVand we prescribe the removal of the asphalt
p207
aVto create an engineered micro landscape,
p208
aVto create an infiltration opportunity.
p209
aa(lp210
VBecause, many of you will know,
p211
aVthat the biggest pollution burden
p212
aVthat we have on the New York, New Jersey harbor right now
p213
aVis no longer the point sources,
p214
aVno longer the big polluters,
p215
aVno longer the GEs,
p216
aVbut that massive network of roads,
p217
aV[those] impervious surfaces,
p218
aVthat collect all that cadmium neurotoxin that comes from your brake liners
p219
aVor the oily hydrocarbon waste
p220
aVin every single storm event and medieval infrastructure
p221
aVwashes it straight into the estuary system.
p222
aVThat doesn't do a lot of good.
p223
aVThese are little opportunities to intercept those pollutants
p224
aVbefore they enter the harbor,
p225
aVand they're produced by impatients
p226
aVon various city blocks
p227
aVin some very interesting ways.
p228
aVI just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though,
p229
aVthere's about two or three fire hydrants
p230
aVon every city block.
p231
aVBy creating engineered micro landscapes to infiltrate in them,
p232
aVwe don't prevent them from being used
p233
aVas emergency vehicle parking spaces,
p234
aVbecause, of course, a firetruck can come and park there.
p235
aVThey flatten a few plants. No big deal, they'll regenerate.
p236
aVBut if we did this
p237
aVin every single \u2014
p238
aVevery fire hydrant
p239
aVwe could redefine the emergency.
p240
aVThat 99 percent of the time
p241
aVwhen a firetruck is not parking there,
p242
aVit's infiltrating pollutants.
p243
aVIt's also increasing fixing CO2s,
p244
aVsequestering some of the airborne pollutants.
p245
aVAnd aggregated,
p246
aVthese smaller interceptions
p247
aVcould actually infiltrate all the roadborne pollution
p248
aVthat now runs into the estuary system,
p249
aVup to a seven inch rain event, up to a hundred-year storm.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo these are small actions
p252
aVthat can amount to a significant effect
p253
aVto improve local environmental health.
p254
aVThis is one of the more ambitious ones.
p255
aVWhat the climate crisis has revealed to us
p256
aVis a secondary, more insidious
p257
aVand more pervasive crisis,
p258
aVwhich is the crisis of agency,
p259
aVwhich is what to do.
p260
aVSomehow buying a local lettuce, changing a light bulb,
p261
aVdriving the speed limit, changing your tires regularly,
p262
aVdoesn't seem sufficient
p263
aVin the face of climate crisis.
p264
aVAnd this is an interesting icon that happened \u2014
p265
aVyou remember these: fallout shelters.
p266
aVWhat is the fallout shelter
p267
aVfor the climate crisis?
p268
aVThis was civic mobilization.
p269
aVChurches, school groups,
p270
aVhospitals, private residents \u2014
p271
aVeveryone built one of these in a matter of months.
p272
aVAnd they still remain
p273
aVas icons of civic response
p274
aVin the face of shared, uncertain, collective threat.
p275
aa(lp276
VFallout shelter for the climate crisis,
p277
aVI would say, looks something like this, or this,
p278
aVwhich is an intensive urban agriculture facility
p279
aVthat's due to go on my lab building at NYU.
p280
aVWhat it does
p281
aVis a very simple idea
p282
aVof taking \u2014
p283
aV80 to 90 percent of the CO2 produced in Manhattan
p284
aVis building related \u2014
p285
aVwe take, just like a commercial greenhouse,
p286
aVwe take the CO2 from the building \u2014
p287
aVCO2-enriched air \u2014
p288
aVwe force it through the urban agriculture facility,
p289
aVand then we resupply oxygen-enriched air.
p290
aVYou can't actually build much on a roof, they're not designed for that.
p291
aVSo it's on legs,
p292
aVso it focuses all the load on the masonry walls and the columns.
p293
aVIt's built as a barn raising,
p294
aVusing open source hardware.
p295
aVThis is the quarter-scale prototype
p296
aVthat was functioning in Spain.
p297
aVThis is what it will look like, fingers crossed,
p298
aVNYU willing.
p299
aa(lp300
VAnd what I want to show you is \u2014
p301
aVactually this is one of the components of it that we've just recently been testing \u2014
p302
aVwhich is a solar chimney \u2014
p303
aVwe have got 17 of them now put around New York at the moment \u2014
p304
aVthat passively draws air up.
p305
aVYou understand a solar chimney.
p306
aVHot air rises.
p307
aVYou put a bit of black plastic on the side of a building,
p308
aVit'll heat up, and you'll get passive airflow.
p309
aVWhat we do is actually
p310
aVput a standard HVAC filter on the top of that.
p311
aVThat actually removes about 95 percent
p312
aVof the carbon black,
p313
aVthat stuff that, with ozone,
p314
aVis responsible for about half of global warming's effects,
p315
aVbecause it changes, it settles on the snow,
p316
aVit changes the reflectors,
p317
aVit changes
p318
aVthe transmission qualities of the atmosphere.
p319
aVCarbon black is that grime
p320
aVthat otherwise lodges in your pretty pink lungs,
p321
aVand it's associated with.
p322
aVIt's not good stuff, and it's from inefficient combustion,
p323
aVnot from combustion itself.
p324
aVWhen we put it through our solar chimney,
p325
aVwe remove actually about 95 percent of that.
p326
aVAnd then I swap it out
p327
aVwith the students
p328
aVand actually re-release that carbon black.
p329
aVAnd we make pencils the length of which measures the grime
p330
aVthat we've pulled out of the air.
p331
aVHere's one of them that we have up now.
p332
aVHere's who put them up and who are avid pencil users.
p333
aa(lp334
VOkay, so I want to show you
p335
aVjust two more interfaces,
p336
aVbecause I think one of our big challenges
p337
aVis re-imagining our relationship to natural systems,
p338
aVnot only through this model
p339
aVof twisted personalized health,
p340
aVbut through the animals
p341
aVwith whom we cohabit.
p342
aVWe are not alone; the animals are moving in.
p343
aVIn fact, urban migration now describes
p344
aVthe movement of animals formerly known as wild
p345
aVinto urban centers.
p346
aVYou know, coyote in Central Park, a whale in the Gowanus Canal,
p347
aVelk in Westchester County.
p348
aVIt's happening all over the Developed World,
p349
aVprobably for loss of habitat,
p350
aVbut also because our cities are a little bit more livable
p351
aVthan they have been.
p352
aVAnd every green space we create
p353
aVis an invitation for non-humans to cohabit with us.
p354
aVBut we've kind of lacked imagination
p355
aVin how we could do that well or interestingly.
p356
aVAnd I want to show you a few of the technological interfaces
p357
aVthat have been developed under the moniker of OOZ \u2014
p358
aVwhich is zoo backwards and without cages \u2014
p359
aVto try and reform
p360
aVthat relationship.
p361
aVThis is communication technology for birds. It looks like this.
p362
aVWhen a bird lands on it, they trigger a sound file.
p363
aVThis is actually in the Whitney Museum, where there were six of them,
p364
aVeach of which had a different argument on it,
p365
aVdifferent sound file.
p366
aVThey said things like this.
p367
aa(lp368
V(Whistling)
p369
aa(lp370
VRecorded Voice: Here's what you need to do.
p371
aVGo down there and buy some of those health food bars,
p372
aVthe ones you call bird food,
p373
aVand bring it here and scatter it around.
p374
aVThere's a good person.
p375
aa(lp376
VNatalie Jeremijenko: Okay. (Laugher)
p377
aVSo there was several of these.
p378
aVThe birds were able to jump from one to the other.
p379
aVThese are just your average urban pigeon.
p380
aVAnd an early test
p381
aVwhich argument elicited cooperative behavior
p382
aVfrom the people below \u2014
p383
aVabout a hundred to one
p384
aVdecided that this was the argument
p385
aVthat worked best on us.
p386
aa(lp387
VRecorded Voice: Tick, tick, tick.
p388
aVThat's the sound of genetic mutations
p389
aVof the avian flu
p390
aVbecoming a deadly human flu.
p391
aVDo you know what slows it down?
p392
aVHealthy sub-populations of birds,
p393
aVincreasing biodiversity generally.
p394
aVIt is in your interests that I'm healthy,
p395
aVhappy, well-fed.
p396
aVHence, you could share some of your nutritional resources
p397
aVinstead of monopolizing them.
p398
aVThat is, share your lunch.
p399
aa(lp400
V(Laughter)
p401
aa(lp402
VNJ: It worked, and it's true.
p403
aVThe final project I'd like to show you
p404
aVis a new interface for fish
p405
aVthat has just been launched \u2014
p406
aVit's actually officially launched next week \u2014
p407
aVwith a wonderful commission from the Architectural League.
p408
aVYou may not have known that you need to communicate with fish,
p409
aVbut there is now a device for you to do so.
p410
aVIt looks like this: buoys that float on the water,
p411
aVproject three foot up, three foot down.
p412
aVWhen a fish swims underneath, a light goes on.
p413
aVThis is what it looks like.
p414
aVSo there's another function on here.
p415
aVThis top light is \u2014 I'm sorry if I'm making you seasick \u2014
p416
aVthis top light is actually a water quality display
p417
aVthat shifts from red, when the dissolved oxygen is low,
p418
aVto a blue/green, when its dissolved oxygen is high.
p419
aVAnd then you can also text the fish.
p420
aVSo there's business cards down there
p421
aVthat'll give you contact details.
p422
aVAnd they text back.
p423
aVWhen the buoys get your text, they wink at you twice to say, we've got your message.
p424
aVBut perhaps the most popular has been
p425
aVthat we've got another array of these boys in the Bronx River,
p426
aVwhere the first beaver \u2014
p427
aVcrazy as he is \u2014
p428
aVto have moved in and built a lodge in New York
p429
aVin 250 years, hangs out.
p430
aVSo updates from a beaver.
p431
aVYou can subscribe to updates from him. You can talk to him.
p432
aa(lp433
VAnd what I like to think of
p434
aVis this is an interface
p435
aVthat re-scripts how we interact with natural systems,
p436
aVspecifically by changing who has information,
p437
aVwhere they have it,
p438
aVwho can make sense of that information,
p439
aVand what you can do about it.
p440
aVIn this case, instead of throwing chewing gum,
p441
aVor Doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish \u2014
p442
aVThere's a body of water in Iceland that I've been dealing with
p443
aVthat's in the middle of the city,
p444
aVand the largest pollution burden on it
p445
aVis not the roadborne pollution,
p446
aVit's actually white bread
p447
aVfrom people feeding the fish and the birds.
p448
aVInstead of doing that actually, we've developed some fish sticks
p449
aVthat you can feed the fish.
p450
aVThey're delicious.
p451
aVThey're cross-species delicious that is,
p452
aVdelicious for humans and non-humans.
p453
aVBut they also have a chelating agent in them.
p454
aVThey're nutritionally appropriate,
p455
aVnot like Doritos.
p456
aVAnd so every time
p457
aVthat desire to interact with the animals,
p458
aVwhich is at least as ubiquitous

aVas that sign: "Do not feed the animals."
p460
aVAnd there's about three of them on every New York City park.
p461
aVAnd Yellowstone National Park,
p462
aVthere's more "do not feed the animals" signs
p463
aVthan there are animals you might wish to feed.
p464
aVBut in that action, that interaction,
p465
aVby re-scripting that,
p466
aVby changing it into an opportunity
p467
aVto offer food that is nutritionally appropriate,
p468
aVthat could augment the nutritional resources
p469
aVthat we ourselves have depleted
p470
aVfor augmenting the fish population
p471
aVand also adding chelating agent,
p472
aVwhich, like any chelating agent that we use medicinally,
p473
aVbinds to the bioaccumulated heavy metals and PCBs
p474
aVthat are in the fish
p475
aVliving in this particular habitat
p476
aVand allows them to pass it out as a harmless salt
p477
aVwhere it's complexed by a reactive,
p478
aVeffectively removing it from bioavailability.
p479
aa(lp480
VBut I wanted to say that interaction,
p481
aVre-scripting that interaction,
p482
aVinto collective action, collective remediative action,
p483
aVvery different from the approach
p484
aVthat's being used on the other side on the Hudson River,
p485
aVwhere we're dredging the PCBs \u2014
p486
aVafter 30 years of legislative and legal struggle,
p487
aVGE's paying for the dredging
p488
aVof the largest Superfund site in the world \u2014
p489
aVwe're dredging it, and it'll probably get shipped off to Pennsylvania
p490
aVor the nearest Third World country,
p491
aVwhere it will continue to be toxic sludge.
p492
aVDisplacement is not the way to deal with environmental issues.
p493
aVAnd that's typically the paradigm
p494
aVunder which we've operated.
p495
aa(lp496
VBy actually taking the opportunity
p497
aVthat new technologies,
p498
aVnew interactive technologies, present
p499
aVto re-script our interactions,
p500
aVto script them,
p501
aVnot just as isolated, individuated interactions,
p502
aVbut as collective aggregating actions
p503
aVthat can amount to something,
p504
aVwe can really begin to address
p505
aVsome of our important environmental challenges.

VWhat is bioenergy? Bioenergy is not ethanol.
p5
aVBioenergy isn't global warming. Bioenergy is
p6
aVsomething which seems counterintuitive. Bioenergy
p7
aVis oil. It's gas. It's coal. And part of building
p8
aVthat bridge to the future, to the point where we
p9
aVcan actually see the oceans in a rational way, or
p10
aVput up these geo-spatial orbits that will twirl or
p11
aVdo microwaves or stuff, is going to depend on how
p12
aVwe understand bioenergy and manage it. And to do
p13
aVthat, you really have to look first at agriculture.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo we've been planting stuff for 11,000 years. And
p16
aVin the measure that we plant stuff, what we learn
p17
aVfrom agriculture is you've got to deal with pests,
p18
aVyou've got to deal with all types of awful things,
p19
aVyou've got to cultivate stuff. In the measure
p20
aVthat you learn how to use water to cultivate, then
p21
aVyou're going to be able to spread beyond the Nile.
p22
aVYou're going to be able to power stuff, so irrigation
p23
aVmakes a difference.
p24
aa(lp25
VIrrigation starts to make you be allowed to plant
p26
aVstuff where you want it, as opposed to where the
p27
aVrivers flood. You start getting this organic
p28
aVagriculture; you start putting machinery onto this
p29
aVstuff. Machinery, with a whole bunch of water,
p30
aVleads to very large-scale agriculture.
p31
aVYou put together machines and water, and you get
p32
aVlandscapes that look like this. And then you get
p33
aVsales that look like this. It's brute force. So
p34
aVwhat you've been doing in agriculture is you start
p35
aVout with something that's a reasonably natural
p36
aVsystem. You start taming that natural system. You
p37
aVput a lot of force behind that natural system. You
p38
aVput a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides \u2014
p39
aV(Laughter) \u2014 behind that natural system, and you
p40
aVend up with systems that look like this.
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd it's all brute force. And that's the way we've
p43
aVbeen approaching energy. So the lesson in
p44
aVagriculture is that you can actually change the
p45
aVsystem that's based on brute force as you start
p46
aVmerging that system and learning that system and
p47
aVactually applying biology. And you move from a
p48
aVdiscipline of engineering, you move from a
p49
aVdiscipline of chemistry, into a discipline of
p50
aVbiology. And probably one of the most important
p51
aVhuman beings on the planet is this guy behind me.
p52
aa(lp53
VThis is a guy called Norman Borlaug. He won the
p54
aVNobel Prize. He's got the Congressional Medal of
p55
aVHonor. He deserves all of this stuff. And he
p56
aVdeserves this stuff because he probably has fed
p57
aVmore people than any other human being alive
p58
aVbecause he researched how to put biology behind
p59
aVseeds. He did this in Mexico. The reason why India
p60
aVand China no longer have these massive famines is
p61
aVbecause Norman Borlaug taught them how to grow
p62
aVgrains in a more efficient way and launched the
p63
aVGreen Revolution. That is something that a lot of
p64
aVpeople have criticized. But of course, those are
p65
aVpeople who don't realize that China and India,
p66
aVinstead of having huge amounts of starving people,
p67
aVare exporting grains.
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd the irony of this particular system is the
p70
aVplace where he did the research, which was Mexico,
p71
aVdidn't adopt this technology, ignored this
p72
aVtechnology, talked about why this technology
p73
aVshould be thought about, but not really applied.
p74
aVAnd Mexico remains one of the largest grain
p75
aVimporters on the planet because it doesn't apply
p76
aVtechnology that was discovered in Mexico. And in
p77
aVfact, hasn't recognized this man, to the point
p78
aVwhere there aren't statues of this man all over
p79
aVMexico. There are in China and India. And the
p80
aVInstitute that this guy ran has now moved to
p81
aVIndia. That is the difference between adopting
p82
aVtechnologies and discussing technologies.
p83
aVNow, it's not just that this guy fed a huge amount
p84
aVof people in the world. It's that this is the net
p85
aVeffect in terms of what technology does, if you
p86
aVunderstand biology.
p87
aa(lp88
VWhat happened in agriculture? Well, if you take
p89
aVagriculture over a century, agriculture in about
p90
aV1900 would have been recognizable to somebody
p91
aVplanting a thousand years earlier. Yeah, the plows look
p92
aVdifferent. The machines were tractors or stuff
p93
aVinstead of mules, but the farmer would have
p94
aVunderstood: this is what the guy's doing, this is
p95
aVwhy he's doing it, this is where he's going. What
p96
aVreally started to change in agriculture is when
p97
aVyou started moving from this brute force
p98
aVengineering and chemistry into biology, and that's
p99
aVwhere you get your productivity increases. And as
p100
aVyou do that stuff, here's what happens to
p101
aVproductivity.
p102
aa(lp103
VBasically, you go from 250 hours to produce 100
p104
aVbushels, to 40, to 15, to five. Agricultural labor
p105
aVproductivity increased seven times, 1950 to 2000,
p106
aVwhereas the rest of the economy increased about
p107
aV2.5 times. This is an absolutely massive increase
p108
aVin how much is produced per person.
p109
aVThe effect of this, of course, is it's not just
p110
aVamber waves of grain, it is mountains of stuff.
p111
aVAnd 50 percent of the EU budget is going to subsidize
p112
aVagriculture from mountains of stuff that people
p113
aVhave overproduced.
p114
aa(lp115
VThis would be a good outcome for energy. And of
p116
aVcourse, by now, you're probably saying to
p117
aVyourself, "Self, I thought I came to a talk about
p118
aVenergy and here's this guy talking about biology."
p119
aVSo where's the link between these two things?
p120
aVOne of the ironies of this whole system is we're
p121
aVdiscussing what to do about a system that we don't
p122
aVunderstand. We don't even know what oil is. We
p123
aVdon't know where oil comes from. I mean,
p124
aVliterally, it's still a source of debate what
p125
aVthis black river of stuff is and where it comes
p126
aVfrom. The best assumption, and one of the best
p127
aVguesses in this stuff, is that this stuff comes
p128
aVout of this stuff, that these things absorb
p129
aVsunlight, rot under pressure for millions of
p130
aVyears, and you get these black rivers.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow, the interesting thing about that thesis \u2014 if
p133
aVthat thesis turns out to be true \u2014 is that oil,
p134
aVand all hydrocarbons, turned out to be
p135
aVconcentrated sunlight. And if you think of
p136
aVbioenergy, bioenergy isn't ethanol. Bioenergy is
p137
aVtaking the sun, concentrating it in amoebas,
p138
aVconcentrating it in plants, and maybe that's why
p139
aVyou get these rainbows.
p140
aVAnd as you're looking at this system, if
p141
aVhydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight, then
p142
aVbioenergy works in a different way. And we've got
p143
aVto start thinking of oil and other hydrocarbons as
p144
aVpart of these solar panels.
p145
aVMaybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly
p146
aVover west Texas, the types of wells that you're
p147
aVbeginning to see don't look unlike those pictures
p148
aVof Kansas and those irrigated plots.
p149
aa(lp150
VThis is how you farm oil. And as you think of
p151
aVfarming oil and how oil has evolved, we started
p152
aVwith this brute force approach. And then what did
p153
aVwe learn? Then we learned we had to go bigger. And
p154
aVthen what'd we learn? Then we have to go even
p155
aVbigger. And we are getting really destructive as
p156
aVwe're going out and farming this bioenergy.
p157
aVThese are the Athabasca tar sands, and there's an
p158
aVenormous amount \u2014 first of mining, the largest
p159
aVtrucks in the world are working here, and then
p160
aVyou've got to pull out this black sludge, which is
p161
aVbasically oil that doesn't flow. It's tied to the
p162
aVsand. And then you've got to use a lot of steam to
p163
aVseparate it, which only works at today's oil
p164
aVprices.
p165
aa(lp166
VCoal. Coal turns out to be virtually the same
p167
aVstuff. It is probably plants, except that these
p168
aVhave been burned and crushed under pressure.
p169
aVSo you take something like this, you burn it, you
p170
aVput it under pressure, and likely as not, you get
p171
aVthis. Although, again, I stress: we don't know.
p172
aVWhich is curious as we debate all this stuff. But
p173
aVas you think of coal, this is what burned wheat
p174
aVkernels look like. Not entirely unlike coal.
p175
aa(lp176
VAnd of course, coalmines are very dangerous
p177
aVplaces because in some of these coalmines, you
p178
aVget gas. When that gas blows up, people die. So
p179
aVyou're producing a biogas out of coal in some
p180
aVmines, but not in others.
p181
aVAny place you see a differential, there're some
p182
aVinteresting questions. There's some questions as
p183
aVto what you should be doing with this stuff. But
p184
aVagain, coal. Maybe the same stuff, maybe the same
p185
aVsystem, maybe bioenergy, and you're applying
p186
aVexactly the same technology.
p187
aa(lp188
VHere's your brute force approach. Once you get
p189
aVthrough your brute force approach, then you just
p190
aVrip off whole mountaintops. And you end up with
p191
aVthe single largest source of carbon emissions,
p192
aVwhich are coal-fired gas plants. That is probably
p193
aVnot the best use of bioenergy.
p194
aVAs you think of what are the alternatives to this
p195
aVsystem \u2014 it's important to find alternatives
p196
aVbecause it turns out that the U.S. is dwindling in
p197
aVits petroleum reserves, but it is not dwindling in
p198
aVits coal reserves, nor is China. There are huge
p199
aVcoal reserves that are sitting out there, and
p200
aVwe've got to start thinking of them as biological
p201
aVenergy, because if we keep treating them as
p202
aVchemical energy, or engineering energy, we're
p203
aVgoing to be in deep doo-doo.
p204
aa(lp205
VGas is a similar issue. Gas is also a biological
p206
aVproduct. And as you think of gas, well, you're
p207
aVfamiliar with gas. And here's a different way of
p208
aVmining coal.
p209
aVThis is called coal bed methane. Why is this
p210
aVpicture interesting? Because if coal turns out to
p211
aVbe concentrated plant life, the reason why you may
p212
aVget a differential in gas output between one mine
p213
aVand another \u2014 the reason why one mine may blow up
p214
aVand another one may not blow up \u2014 may be because
p215
aVthere's stuff eating that stuff and producing gas.
p216
aVThis is a well-known phenomenon. (Laughter) You
p217
aVeat certain things, you produce a lot of gas. It
p218
aVmay turn out that biological processes in coalmines
p219
aVhave the same process. If that is true, then
p220
aVone of the ways of getting the energy out of coal
p221
aVmay not be to rip whole mountaintops off, and it
p222
aVmay not be to burn coal. It may be to have stuff
p223
aVprocess that coal in a biological fashion as you
p224
aVdid in agriculture.
p225
aa(lp226
VThat is what bioenergy is. It is not ethanol. It
p227
aVis not subsidies to a few companies. It is not
p228
aVimporting corn into Iowa because you've built so
p229
aVmany of these ethanol plants. It is beginning to
p230
aVunderstand the transition that occurred in
p231
aVagriculture, from brute force into biological
p232
aVforce. And in the measure that you can do that,
p233
aVyou can clean some stuff, and you can clean it
p234
aVpretty quickly.
p235
aVWe already have some indicators of productivity on
p236
aVthis stuff. OK, if you put steam into coal fields
p237
aVor petroleum fields that have been running for
p238
aVdecades, you can get a really substantial
p239
aVincrease, like an eight-fold increase, in your
p240
aVoutput. This is just the beginning stages of this
p241
aVstuff.
p242
aa(lp243
VAnd as you think of biomaterials, this guy \u2014 who
p244
aVdid part of the sequencing of the human genome,
p245
aVwho just doubled the databases of genes and
p246
aVproteins known on earth by sailing around the
p247
aVworld \u2014 has been thinking about how you structure
p248
aVthis. And there's a series of smart people
p249
aVthinking about this. And they've been putting
p250
aVtogether companies like Synthetic Genomics, like,
p251
aVa Cambria, like Codon, and what those companies are
p252
aVtrying to do is to think of, how do you apply
p253
aVbiological principles to avoid brute force?
p254
aVThink of it in the following terms. Think of it as
p255
aVbeginning to program stuff for specific purposes.
p256
aVThink of the cell as a hardware. Think of the
p257
aVgenes as a software. And in the measure that you
p258
aVbegin to think of life as code that is
p259
aVinterchangeable, that can become energy, that can
p260
aVbecome food, that can become fiber, that can
p261
aVbecome human beings, that can become a whole
p262
aVseries of things, then you've got to shift your
p263
aVapproach as to how you're going to structure and
p264
aVdeal and think about energy in a very different
p265
aVway.
p266
aa(lp267
VWhat are the first principles of this stuff and
p268
aVwhere are we heading? This is one of the gentle
p269
aVgiants on the planet. He's one of the nicest human
p270
aVbeings you've ever met. His name is Hamilton
p271
aVSmith. He won the Nobel for figuring out how to
p272
aVcut genes \u2014 something called restriction enzymes.
p273
aVHe was at Hopkins when he did this, and he's such
p274
aVa modest guy that the day he won, his mother
p275
aVcalled him and said, "I didn't realize there was
p276
aVanother Ham Smith at Hopkins. Do you know he just
p277
aVwon the Nobel?" (Laughter) I mean, that was Mom,
p278
aVbut anyway, this guy is just a class act. You find
p279
aVhim at the bench every single day, working on a
p280
aVpipette and building stuff. And one of the things
p281
aVthis guy just built are these things.
p282
aa(lp283
VWhat is this? This is the first transplant of
p284
aVnaked DNA, where you take an entire DNA operating
p285
aVsystem out of one cell, insert it into a different
p286
aVcell, and have that cell boot up as a separate
p287
aVspecies. That's one month old. You will see stuff
p288
aVin the next month that will be just as important
p289
aVas this stuff.
p290
aVAnd as you think about this stuff and what the
p291
aVimplications of this are, we're going to start not
p292
aVjust converting ethanol from corn with very high
p293
aVsubsidies. We're going to start thinking about
p294
aVbiology entering energy. It is very expensive to
p295
aVprocess this stuff, both in economic terms and in
p296
aVenergy terms.
p297
aa(lp298
VThis is what accumulates in the tar sands of
p299
aVAlberta. These are sulfur blocks. Because as you
p300
aVseparate that petroleum from the sand, and use an
p301
aVenormous amount of energy inside that vapor \u2014
p302
aVsteam to separate this stuff \u2014 you also have to
p303
aVseparate out the sulfur. The difference between
p304
aVlight crude and heavy crude \u2014 well, it's about 14
p305
aVbucks a barrel. That's why you're building these
p306
aVpyramids of sulfur blocks. And by the way, the
p307
aVscale on these things is pretty large.
p308
aa(lp309
VNow, if you can take part of the energy content
p310
aVout of doing this, you reduce the system, and you
p311
aVreally do start applying biological principles to
p312
aVenergy. This has to be a bridge to the point where
p313
aVyou can get to wind, to the point where you can
p314
aVget to solar, to the point where you can get to
p315
aVnuclear \u2014 and hopefully you won't build the next
p316
aVnuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an
p317
aVearthquake fault. (Laughter) Just a thought.
p318
aa(lp319
VBut in the meantime, for the next decade at least,
p320
aVthe name of the game is hydrocarbons. And be that
p321
aVoil, be that gas, be that coal, this is what we're
p322
aVdealing with. And before I make this talk too
p323
aVlong, here's what's happening in the current
p324
aVenergy system.
p325
aV86 percent of the energy we consume are
p326
aVhydrocarbons. That means 86 percent of the stuff we're
p327
aVconsuming are probably processed plants and
p328
aVamoebas and the rest of the stuff. And there's a
p329
aVrole in here for conservation. There's a role in
p330
aVhere for alternative stuff, but we've also got to
p331
aVget that other portion right.
p332
aVHow we deal with that other portion is our bridge
p333
aVto the future. And as we think of this bridge to
p334
aVthe future, one of the things you should ponder
p335
aVis: we are leaving about two-thirds of the oil today
p336
aVinside those wells. So we're spending an enormous
p337
aVamount of money and leaving most of the energy
p338
aVdown there. Which, of course, requires more energy
p339
aVto go out and get energy. The ratios become
p340
aVidiotic by the time you get to ethanol. It may
p341
aVeven be a one-to-one ratio on the energy input and
p342
aVthe energy output. That is a stupid way of
p343
aVmanaging this system.
p344
aa(lp345
VLast point, last graph. One of the things that
p346
aVwe've got to do is to stabilize oil prices. This
p347
aVis what oil prices look like, OK?
p348
aVThis is a very bad system because what happens is
p349
aVyour hurdle rate gets set very low. People come up
p350
aVwith really smart ideas for solar panels, or for
p351
aVwind, or for something else, and then guess what?
p352
aVThe oil price goes through the floor. That company
p353
aVgoes out of business, and then you can bring the
p354
aVoil price back up.
p355
aa(lp356
VSo if I had one closing and modest suggestion,
p357
aVlet's set a stable oil price in Europe and the
p358
aVUnited States. How do you do that? Well, let's put
p359
aVa tax on oil that is a non-revenue tax, and it
p360
aVbasically says for the next 20 years, the price of
p361
aVoil will be \u2014 whatever you want, 35 bucks, 40
p362
aVbucks. If the OPEC price falls below that, we tax
p363
aVit. If the OPEC price goes above that, the tax
p364
aVgoes away.
p365
aVWhat does that do for entrepreneurs? What does it
p366
aVdo for companies? It tells people, if you can
p367
aVproduce energy for less than 35 bucks a barrel, or
p368
aVless than 40 bucks a barrel, or less than 50 bucks
p369
aVa barrel \u2014 let's debate it \u2014 you will have a
p370
aVbusiness. But let's not put people through this
p371
aVcycle where it doesn't pay to research because
p372
aVyour company will go out of business as OPEC
p373
aVdrives alternatives and keeps bioenergy from
p374
aVhappening. Thank you.

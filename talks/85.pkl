VI thought in getting up to my TED wish
p5
aVI would try to begin by putting in  perspective what I try to do
p6
aVand how it fits with what they try to do.
p7
aVWe live in a world that everyone knows is interdependent,
p8
aVbut insufficient in three major ways.
p9
aVIt is, first of all, profoundly unequal:
p10
aVhalf the world's people still living on less than two dollars a day;
p11
aVa billion people with no access to clean water;
p12
aVtwo and a half billion no access to sanitation;
p13
aVa billion going to bed hungry every night;
p14
aVone in four deaths every year from AIDS, TB, malaria
p15
aVand the variety of infections associated with dirty water \u2014
p16
aV80 percent of them under five years of age.
p17
aa(lp18
VEven in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing.
p19
aVIn the United States, since 2001 we've had five years of economic growth,
p20
aVfive years of productivity growth in the workplace,
p21
aVbut median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families
p22
aVdropping below the poverty line is up by four percent.
p23
aVThe percentage of working families without health care up by four percent.
p24
aVSo this interdependent world which has been pretty good to most of us \u2014
p25
aVwhich is why we're all here in Northern California doing what we do
p26
aVfor a living, enjoying this evening \u2014 is profoundly unequal.
p27
aVIt is also unstable.
p28
aVUnstable because of the threats of terror,
p29
aVweapons of mass destruction, the spread of global disease
p30
aVand a sense that we are vulnerable to it in a way that we weren't not so many years ago.
p31
aVAnd perhaps most important of all, it is unsustainable
p32
aVbecause of climate change, resource depletion and species destruction.
p33
aa(lp34
VWhen I think about the world I would like to leave to my daughter
p35
aVand the grandchildren I hope to have,
p36
aVit is a world that moves away from unequal, unstable, unsustainable
p37
aVinterdependence to integrated communities \u2014 locally, nationally and globally \u2014
p38
aVthat share the characteristics of all successful communities:
p39
aVa broadly shared, accessible set of opportunities,
p40
aVa shared sense of responsibility for the success of the common enterprise
p41
aVand a genuine sense of belonging.
p42
aVAll easier said than done.
p43
aVWhen the terrorist incidents occurred in the United Kingdom a couple of years ago,
p44
aVI think even though they didn't claim as many lives as we lost in the United States on 9/11,
p45
aVI think the thing that troubled the British most
p46
aVwas that the perpetrators were not invaders, but homegrown citizens
p47
aVwhose religious and political identities were more important to them
p48
aVthan the people they grew up with, went to school with,
p49
aVworked with, shared weekends with, shared meals with.
p50
aVIn other words, they thought their differences
p51
aVwere more important than their common humanity.
p52
aVIt is the central psychological plague of humankind in the 21st century.
p53
aa(lp54
VInto this mix, people like us, who are not in public office,
p55
aVhave more power to do good than at any time in history,
p56
aVbecause more than half the world's people
p57
aVlive under governments they voted in and can vote out.
p58
aVAnd even non-democratic governments are more sensitive to public opinion.
p59
aVBecause primarily of the power of the Internet,
p60
aVpeople of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money
p61
aVthat can change the world for some public good if they all agree.
p62
aVWhen the tsunami hit South Asia, the United States contributed 1.2 billion dollars.
p63
aV30 percent of our households gave.
p64
aVHalf of them gave over the Internet.
p65
aVThe median contribution was somewhere around 57 dollars.
p66
aVAnd thirdly, because of the rise of non-governmental organizations.
p67
aVThey, businesses, other citizens' groups, have enormous power
p68
aVto affect the lives of our fellow human beings.
p69
aVWhen I became president in 1993,
p70
aVthere were none of these organizations in Russia.
p71
aVThere are now a couple of hundred thousand.
p72
aVNone in India. There are now at least a half a million active.
p73
aVNone in China. There are now 250,000 registered with the government,
p74
aVprobably twice again that many who are not registered for political reasons.
p75
aa(lp76
VWhen I organized my foundation, and I thought about the world as it is
p77
aVand the world that I hope to leave to the next generation,
p78
aVand I tried to be realistic about what I had cared about all my life
p79
aVthat I could still have an impact on.
p80
aVI wanted to focus on activities
p81
aVthat would help to alleviate poverty, fight disease, combat climate change,
p82
aVbridge the religious, racial and other divides that torment the world,
p83
aVbut to do it in a way that would either use
p84
aVwhatever particular skills we could put together in our group
p85
aVto change the way some public good function was performed
p86
aVso that it would sweep across the world more.
p87
aa(lp88
VYou saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with AIDS drugs.
p89
aVAnd I want to say that the head of our AIDS effort,
p90
aVand the person who also is primarily active in the wish I'll make tonight,
p91
aVIra Magaziner, is here with me and I want to thank him for everything he's done.
p92
aVHe's over there.
p93
aV(Applause)
p94
aVWhen I got out of office and was asked to work, first in the Caribbean,
p95
aVto try to help deal with the AIDS crisis,
p96
aVgeneric drugs were available for about 500 dollars a person a year.
p97
aVIf you bought them in vast bulks,
p98
aVyou could get them at a little under 400 dollars.
p99
aVThe first country we went to work in, the Bahamas,
p100
aVwas paying 3,500 dollars for these drugs.
p101
aVThe market was so terribly disorganized
p102
aVthat they were buying this medicine through two agents
p103
aVwho were gigging them sevenfold.
p104
aVSo the very first week we were working,
p105
aVwe got the price down to 500 dollars.
p106
aVAnd all of a sudden, they could save seven times as many lives
p107
aVfor the same amount of money.
p108
aa(lp109
VThen we went to work with the manufacturers of AIDS medicines,
p110
aVone of whom was cited in the film,
p111
aVand negotiated a whole different change in business strategy,
p112
aVbecause even at 500 dollars, these drugs
p113
aVwere being sold on a high-margin, low-volume, uncertain-payment basis.
p114
aVSo we worked on improving the productivity of the operations
p115
aVand the supply chain, and went to a low-margin, high-volume,
p116
aVabsolutely certain-payment business.
p117
aVI joked that the main contribution we made
p118
aVto the battle against AIDS was to get the manufacturers
p119
aVto change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy.
p120
aVBut the price went to 140 dollars from 500.
p121
aVAnd pretty soon, the average price was 192 dollars.
p122
aVNow we can get it for about 100 dollars.
p123
aVChildren's medicine was 600 dollars,
p124
aVbecause nobody could afford to buy any of it.
p125
aVWe negotiated it down to 190.
p126
aVThen, the French imposed their brilliantly conceived airline tax
p127
aVto create a something called UNITAID,
p128
aVgot a bunch of other countries to help.
p129
aVThat children's medicine is now 60 dollars a person a year.
p130
aa(lp131
VThe only thing that is keeping us from basically saving the lives
p132
aVof everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive
p133
aVare the absence of systems necessary to diagnose, treat and care
p134
aVfor people and deliver this medicine.
p135
aVWe started a childhood obesity initiative with the Heart Association in America.
p136
aVWe tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry-right deals
p137
aVwith the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric
p138
aVand other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools.
p139
aVWe just reorganized the markets.
p140
aVAnd it occurred to me that in this whole non-governmental world,
p141
aVsomebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets.
p142
aVAnd that is now what we're trying to do,
p143
aVand working with this large cities group to fight climate change,
p144
aVto negotiate huge, big, volume deals that will enable cities
p145
aVwhich generate 75 percent of the world's greenhouse gases,
p146
aVto drastically and quickly reduce greenhouse gas emissions
p147
aVin a way that is good economics.
p148
aVAnd this whole discussion as if it's some sort of economic burden,
p149
aVis a mystery to me.
p150
aVI think it's a bird's nest on the ground.
p151
aa(lp152
VWhen Al Gore won his well-deserved Oscar
p153
aVfor the "Inconvenient Truth" movie, I was thrilled,
p154
aVbut I had urged him to make a second movie quickly.
p155
aVFor those of you who saw "An Inconvenient Truth,"
p156
aVthe most important slide in the Gore lecture is the last one,
p157
aVwhich shows here's where greenhouse gases are going
p158
aVif we don't do anything, here's where they could go.
p159
aVAnd then there are six different categories
p160
aVof things we can do to change the trajectory.
p161
aVWe need a movie on those six categories.
p162
aVAnd all of you need to have it embedded in your brains
p163
aVand to organize yourselves around it.
p164
aVSo we're trying to do that.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo organizing these markets is one thing we try to do.
p167
aVNow we have taken on a second thing, and this gets to my wish.
p168
aVIt has been my experience in working in developing countries
p169
aVthat while the headlines may all be \u2014 the pessimistic headlines may say,
p170
aVwell, we can't do this, that or the other thing because of corruption \u2014
p171
aVI think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption,
p172
aVand feeds corruption.
p173
aVWe now have the money, given these low prices, to distribute
p174
aVAIDS drugs all over the world to people we cannot presently reach.
p175
aVToday these low prices are available in the 25 countries where we work,
p176
aVand in a total of 62 countries,
p177
aVand about 550,000 people are getting the benefits of them.
p178
aVBut the money is there to reach others.
p179
aVThe systems are not there to reach the people.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo what we have been trying to do,
p182
aVworking first in Rwanda and then in Malawi and other places \u2014
p183
aVbut I want to talk about Rwanda tonight \u2014
p184
aVis to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area
p185
aVthat can be used to deal with AIDS, TB, malaria, other infectious diseases,
p186
aVmaternal and child health, and a whole range of health issues
p187
aVpoor people are grappling with in the developing world,
p188
aVthat can first be scaled for the whole nation of Rwanda,
p189
aVand then will be a model that could literally
p190
aVbe implemented in any other poor country in the world.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd the test is: one, will it do the job?
p193
aVWill it provide high quality care?
p194
aVAnd two, will it do it at a price
p195
aVthat will enable the country to sustain a health care system
p196
aVwithout foreign donors after five to 10 years?
p197
aVBecause the longer I deal with these problems,
p198
aVthe more convinced I am that we have to \u2014
p199
aVwhether it's economics, health, education, whatever \u2014
p200
aVwe have to build systems.
p201
aVAnd the absence of systems that function
p202
aVbreak the connection which got you all in this seat tonight.
p203
aVYou think about whatever your life has been,
p204
aVhowever many obstacles you have faced in your life,
p205
aVat critical junctures you always knew
p206
aVthere was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted
p207
aVand the result you achieved.
p208
aVIn a world with no systems, with chaos,
p209
aVeverything becomes a guerilla struggle,
p210
aVand this predictability is not there.
p211
aVAnd it becomes almost impossible to save lives,
p212
aVeducate kids, develop economies, whatever.
p213
aa(lp214
VThe person, in my view,
p215
aVwho has done the best job of this in the health care area,
p216
aVof building a system in a very poor area, is Dr. Paul Farmer,
p217
aVwho, many of you know, has worked for now 20 years with his group,
p218
aVPartners in Health, primarily in Haiti where he started,
p219
aVbut they've also worked in Russia, in Peru
p220
aVand other places around the world.
p221
aVAs poor as Haiti is, in the area where Farmer's clinic is active \u2014
p222
aVand they serve a catchment area far greater
p223
aVthan the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve \u2014
p224
aVsince 1988, they have not lost one person to tuberculosis, not one.
p225
aVAnd they've achieved a lot of other amazing health results.
p226
aVSo when we decided to work in Rwanda
p227
aVon trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the AIDS problem,
p228
aVwe wanted to build a healthcare network,
p229
aVbecause it had been totally destroyed during the genocide in 1994,
p230
aVand the per capita income was still under a dollar a day.
p231
aVSo I rang up, asked Paul Farmer if he would help.
p232
aVBecause it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in Haiti
p233
aVand a model in Rwanda that we could then take all over the country,
p234
aVnumber one, it would be a wonderful thing for a country
p235
aVthat has suffered as much as any on Earth in the last 15 years,
p236
aVand number two, we would have something that could then be adapted
p237
aVto any other poor country anywhere in the world.
p238
aVAnd so we have set about doing that.
p239
aa(lp240
VNow, we started working together 18 months ago.
p241
aVAnd we're working in an area called Southern Kayonza,
p242
aVwhich is one of the poorest areas in Rwanda,
p243
aVwith a group that originally includes about 400,000 people.
p244
aVWe're essentially implementing what Paul Farmer did in Haiti:
p245
aVhe develops and trains paid community health workers
p246
aVwho are able to identify health problems,
p247
aVensure that people who have AIDS or TB are properly diagnosed
p248
aVand take their medicine regularly,
p249
aVwho work on bringing about health education, clean water and sanitation,
p250
aVproviding nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care
p251
aVif they have problems of the severity that require it.
p252
aVThe procedures that make this work have been perfected,
p253
aVas I said, by Paul Farmer and his team
p254
aVin their work in rural Haiti over the last 20 years.
p255
aVRecently we did an evaluation of the first 18 months of our efforts in Rwanda.
p256
aVAnd the results were so good that the Rwandan government
p257
aVhas now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country,
p258
aVand has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it.
p259
aa(lp260
VI'll tell you a little bit about our team because it's indicative of what we do.
p261
aVWe have about 500 people around the world
p262
aVworking in our AIDS program, some of them for nothing \u2014
p263
aVjust for transportation, room and board.
p264
aVAnd then we have others working in these other related programs.
p265
aVOur business plan in Rwanda
p266
aVwas put together under the leadership of Diana Noble,
p267
aVwho is an unusually gifted woman,
p268
aVbut not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work.
p269
aVShe was the youngest partner at Schroder Ventures in London in her 20s.
p270
aVShe was CEO of a successful e-venture \u2014
p271
aVshe started and built Reed Elsevier Ventures \u2014
p272
aVand at 45 she decided she wanted to do something different with her life.
p273
aVSo she now works full-time on this for very little pay.
p274
aVShe and her team of former business people have created a business plan
p275
aVthat will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country.
p276
aVAnd it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work
p277
aVshe used to do when she was making a lot more money for it.
p278
aa(lp279
VWhen we came to this rural area, 45 percent of the children under the age of five
p280
aVhad stunted growth due to malnutrition.
p281
aV23 percent of them died before they reached the age of five.
p282
aVMortality at birth was over two-and-a-half percent.
p283
aVOver 15 percent of the deaths among adults and children occurred
p284
aVbecause of intestinal parasites and diarrhea from dirty water and inadequate sanitation \u2014
p285
aVall entirely preventable and treatable.
p286
aVOver 13 percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses \u2014
p287
aVagain, all preventable and treatable.
p288
aVAnd not a single soul in this area was being treated for AIDS or tuberculosis.
p289
aa(lp290
VWithin the first 18 months, the following things happened:
p291
aVwe went from zero to about 2,000 people being treated for AIDS.
p292
aVThat's 80 percent of the people who need treatment in this area.
p293
aVListen to this: less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated
p294
aVstopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment.
p295
aVThat's lower than the figure in the United States.
p296
aVLess than three-tenths of one percent
p297
aVhad to transfer to the more expensive second-line drugs.
p298
aV400,000 pregnant women were brought into counseling
p299
aVand will give birth for the first time within an organized healthcare system.
p300
aVThat's about 43 percent of all the pregnancies.
p301
aVAbout 40 percent of all the people \u2014 I said 400,000. I meant 40,000.
p302
aVAbout 40 percent of all the people who need TB treatment are now getting it \u2014
p303
aVin just 18 months, up from zero when we started.
p304
aV43 percent of the children in need of an infant feeding program
p305
aVto prevent malnutrition and early death
p306
aVare now getting the food supplements they need to stay alive and to grow.
p307
aa(lp308
VWe've started the first malaria treatment programs they've ever had there.
p309
aVPatients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide
p310
aVthat we have renovated along with four other clinics,
p311
aVcomplete with solar power generators, good lab technology.
p312
aVWe now are treating 325 people a month,
p313
aVdespite the fact that almost 100 percent of the AIDS patients are now treated at home.
p314
aVAnd the most important thing is
p315
aVbecause we've implemented Paul Farmer's model, using community health workers,
p316
aVwe estimate that this system could be put into place for all of Rwanda
p317
aVfor between five and six percent of GDP,
p318
aVand that the government could sustain that
p319
aVwithout depending on foreign aid after five or six years.
p320
aVAnd for those of you who understand healthcare economics
p321
aVyou know that all wealthy countries spend between nine and 11 percent of GDP
p322
aVon health care, except for the United States, we spend 16 \u2014
p323
aVbut that's a story for another day.
p324
aV(Laughter)
p325
aa(lp326
VWe're now working with Partners in Health and the Ministry of Health in Rwanda
p327
aVand our Foundation folks to scale this system up.
p328
aVWe're also beginning to do this in Malawi and Lesotho.
p329
aVAnd we have similar projects in Tanzania, Mozambique,
p330
aVKenya and Ethiopia with other partners trying to achieve the same thing:
p331
aVto save as many lives as quickly as we can,
p332
aVbut to do it in a systematic way that can be implemented nationwide
p333
aVand then with a model that can be implemented in any country in the world.
p334
aVWe need initial upfront investment to train doctors, nurses,
p335
aVhealth administration and community health workers throughout the country,
p336
aVto set up the information technology, the solar energy,
p337
aVthe water and sanitation, the transportation infrastructure.
p338
aVBut over a five- to 10-year period,
p339
aVwe will take down the need for outside assistance
p340
aVand eventually it will be phased out.
p341
aa(lp342
VMy wish is that TED assist us in our work and help us to build
p343
aVa high-quality rural health system in a poor country, Rwanda,
p344
aVthat can be a model for Africa,
p345
aVand indeed, for any poor country anywhere in the world.
p346
aVMy belief is that this will help us to build a more integrated world
p347
aVwith more partners and fewer terrorists,
p348
aVwith more productive citizens and fewer haters,
p349
aVa place we'd all want our kids and our grandchildren to grow up in.
p350
aVIt has been an honor for me, particularly, to work in Rwanda
p351
aVwhere we also have a major economic development project
p352
aVin partnership with Sir Tom Hunter, the Scottish philanthropist,
p353
aVwhere last year we, using the same thing with AIDS drugs,
p354
aVcut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates on microcredit loans by 30 percent
p355
aVand achieved three- to four-hundred percent increases
p356
aVin crop yields with the farmers.
p357
aa(lp358
VThese people have been through a lot and none of us, most of all me,
p359
aVhelped them when they were on the verge of destroying each other.
p360
aVWe're undoing that now, and they are so over it and so into their future.
p361
aVWe're doing this in an environmentally responsible way.
p362
aVI'm doing my best to convince them not to run the electric grid
p363
aVto the 35 percent of the people that have no access,
p364
aVbut to do it with clean energy. To have responsible reforestation projects,
p365
aVthe Rwandans, interestingly enough, have been quite good, Mr. Wilson,
p366
aVin preserving their topsoil.
p367
aVThere's a couple of guys from southern farming families \u2014
p368
aVthe first thing I did when I went out to this place
p369
aVwas to get down on my hands and knees and dig in the dirt
p370
aVand see what they'd done with it.
p371
aa(lp372
VWe have a chance here to prove that a country
p373
aVthat almost slaughtered itself out of existence
p374
aVcan practice reconciliation, reorganize itself, focus on tomorrow
p375
aVand provide comprehensive, quality health care with minimal outside help.
p376
aVI am grateful for this prize, and I will use it to that end.
p377
aVWe could use some more help to do this,
p378
aVbut think of what it would mean if we could have a world-class health system
p379
aVin Rwanda \u2014 in a country with a less-than-one-dollar-a-day-per-capita income,
p380
aVone that could save hundreds of millions of lives
p381
aVover the next decade if applied to every similarly situated country on Earth.
p382
aVIt's worth a try and I believe it would succeed.
p383
aVThank you and God bless you.

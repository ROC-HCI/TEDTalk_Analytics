VI love a great mystery,
p5
aVand I'm fascinated by the greatest unsolved mystery in science,
p6
aVperhaps because it's personal.
p7
aVIt's about who we are,
p8
aVand I can't help but be curious.
p9
aa(lp10
VThe mystery is this:
p11
aVWhat is the relationship between your brain
p12
aVand your conscious experiences,
p13
aVsuch as your experience of the taste of chocolate
p14
aVor the feeling of velvet?
p15
aa(lp16
VNow, this mystery is not new.
p17
aVIn 1868, Thomas Huxley wrote,
p18
aV"How it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about
p19
aVas the result of irritating nervous tissue
p20
aVis just as unaccountable
p21
aVas the appearance of the genie when Aladdin rubbed his lamp."
p22
aVNow, Huxley knew that brain activity
p23
aVand conscious experiences are correlated,
p24
aVbut he didn't know why.
p25
aVTo the science of his day, it was a mystery.
p26
aVIn the years since Huxley,
p27
aVscience has learned a lot about brain activity,
p28
aVbut the relationship between brain activity
p29
aVand conscious experiences is still a mystery.
p30
aVWhy? Why have we made so little progress?
p31
aVWell, some experts think that we can't solve this problem
p32
aVbecause we lack the necessary concepts and intelligence.
p33
aVWe don't expect monkeys to solve problems in quantum mechanics,
p34
aVand as it happens, we can't expect our species to solve this problem either.
p35
aVWell, I disagree. I'm more optimistic.
p36
aVI think we've simply made a false assumption.
p37
aVOnce we fix it, we just might solve this problem.
p38
aVToday, I'd like tell you what that assumption is,
p39
aVwhy it's false, and how to fix it.
p40
aa(lp41
VLet's begin with a question:
p42
aVDo we see reality as it is?
p43
aVI open my eyes
p44
aVand I have an experience that I describe as a red tomato a meter away.
p45
aVAs a result, I come to believe that in reality,
p46
aVthere's a red tomato a meter away.
p47
aVI then close my eyes, and my experience changes to a gray field,
p48
aVbut is it still the case that in reality, there's a red tomato a meter away?
p49
aVI think so, but could I be wrong?
p50
aVCould I be misinterpreting the nature of my perceptions?
p51
aa(lp52
VWe have misinterpreted our perceptions before.
p53
aVWe used to think the Earth is flat, because it looks that way.
p54
aVPythagorus discovered that we were wrong.
p55
aVThen we thought that the Earth is the unmoving center of the Universe,
p56
aVagain because it looks that way.
p57
aVCopernicus and Galileo discovered, again, that we were wrong.
p58
aa(lp59
VGalileo then wondered if we might be misinterpreting our experiences
p60
aVin other ways.
p61
aVHe wrote: "I think that tastes, odors, colors, and so on
p62
aVreside in consciousness.
p63
aVHence if the living creature were removed, all these qualities would be annihilated."
p64
aa(lp65
VNow, that's a stunning claim.
p66
aVCould Galileo be right?
p67
aVCould we really be misinterpreting our experiences that badly?
p68
aVWhat does modern science have to say about this?
p69
aa(lp70
VWell, neuroscientists tell us that about a third of the brain's cortex
p71
aVis engaged in vision.
p72
aVWhen you simply open your eyes and look about this room,
p73
aVbillions of neurons and trillions of synapses are engaged.
p74
aa(lp75
VNow, this is a bit surprising,
p76
aVbecause to the extent that we think about vision at all,
p77
aVwe think of it as like a camera.
p78
aVIt just takes a picture of objective reality as it is.
p79
aVNow, there is a part of vision that's like a camera:
p80
aVthe eye has a lens that focuses an image on the back of the eye
p81
aVwhere there are 130 million photoreceptors,
p82
aVso the eye is like a 130-megapixel camera.
p83
aVBut that doesn't explain the billions of neurons
p84
aVand trillions of synapses that are engaged in vision.
p85
aVWhat are these neurons up to?
p86
aa(lp87
VWell, neuroscientists tell us that they are creating, in real time,
p88
aVall the shapes, objects, colors, and motions that we see.
p89
aVIt feels like we're just taking a snapshot of this room the way it is,
p90
aVbut in fact, we're constructing everything that we see.
p91
aVWe don't construct the whole world at once.
p92
aVWe construct what we need in the moment.
p93
aa(lp94
VNow, there are many demonstrations that are quite compelling
p95
aVthat we construct what we see.
p96
aVI'll just show you two.
p97
aVIn this example, you see some red discs with bits cut out of them,
p98
aVbut if I just rotate the disks a little bit,
p99
aVsuddenly, you see a 3D cube pop out of the screen.
p100
aVNow, the screen of course is flat,
p101
aVso the three-dimensional cube that you're experiencing
p102
aVmust be your construction.
p103
aa(lp104
VIn this next example,
p105
aVyou see glowing blue bars with pretty sharp edges
p106
aVmoving across a field of dots.
p107
aVIn fact, no dots move.
p108
aVAll I'm doing from frame to frame is changing the colors of dots
p109
aVfrom blue to black or black to blue.
p110
aVBut when I do this quickly,
p111
aVyour visual system creates the glowing blue bars
p112
aVwith the sharp edges and the motion.
p113
aVThere are many more examples, but these are just two
p114
aVthat you construct what you see.
p115
aa(lp116
VBut neuroscientists go further.
p117
aVThey say that we reconstruct reality.
p118
aVSo, when I have an experience that I describe as a red tomato,
p119
aVthat experience is actually an accurate reconstruction
p120
aVof the properties of a real red tomato
p121
aVthat would exist even if I weren't looking.
p122
aa(lp123
VNow, why would neuroscientists say that we don't just construct,
p124
aVwe reconstruct?
p125
aVWell, the standard argument given
p126
aVis usually an evolutionary one.
p127
aVThose of our ancestors who saw more accurately
p128
aVhad a competitive advantage compared to those who saw less accurately,
p129
aVand therefore they were more likely to pass on their genes.
p130
aVWe are the offspring of those who saw more accurately,
p131
aVand so we can be confident that, in the normal case,
p132
aVour perceptions are accurate.
p133
aVYou see this in the standard textbooks.
p134
aVOne textbook says, for example,
p135
aV"Evolutionarily speaking,
p136
aVvision is useful precisely because it is so accurate."
p137
aVSo the idea is that accurate perceptions are fitter perceptions.
p138
aVThey give you a survival advantage.
p139
aa(lp140
VNow, is this correct?
p141
aVIs this the right interpretation of evolutionary theory?
p142
aVWell, let's first look at a couple of examples in nature.
p143
aa(lp144
VThe Australian jewel beetle
p145
aVis dimpled, glossy and brown.
p146
aVThe female is flightless.
p147
aVThe male flies, looking, of course, for a hot female.
p148
aVWhen he finds one, he alights and mates.
p149
aVThere's another species in the outback,
p150
aVHomo sapiens.
p151
aVThe male of this species has a massive brain
p152
aVthat he uses to hunt for cold beer.
p153
aV(Laughter)
p154
aVAnd when he finds one, he drains it,
p155
aVand sometimes throws the bottle into the outback.
p156
aVNow, as it happens, these bottles are dimpled, glossy,
p157
aVand just the right shade of brown to tickle the fancy of these beetles.
p158
aVThe males swarm all over the bottles trying to mate.
p159
aVThey lose all interest in the real females.
p160
aVClassic case of the male leaving the female for the bottle.
p161
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p162
aVThe species almost went extinct.
p163
aVAustralia had to change its bottles to save its beetles.
p164
aV(Laughter)
p165
aVNow, the males had successfully found females for thousands,
p166
aVperhaps millions of years.
p167
aVIt looked like they saw reality as it is, but apparently not.
p168
aVEvolution had given them a hack.
p169
aVA female is anything dimpled, glossy and brown,
p170
aVthe bigger the better.
p171
aV(Laughter)
p172
aVEven when crawling all over the bottle, the male couldn't discover his mistake.
p173
aa(lp174
VNow, you might say, beetles, sure, they're very simple creatures,
p175
aVbut surely not mammals.
p176
aVMammals don't rely on tricks.
p177
aVWell, I won't dwell on this, but you get the idea. (Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
VSo this raises an important technical question:
p180
aVDoes natural selection really favor seeing reality as it is?
p181
aVFortunately, we don't have to wave our hands and guess;
p182
aVevolution is a mathematically precise theory.
p183
aVWe can use the equations of evolution to check this out.
p184
aVWe can have various organisms in artificial worlds compete
p185
aVand see which survive and which thrive,
p186
aVwhich sensory systems are more fit.
p187
aa(lp188
VA key notion in those equations is fitness.
p189
aVConsider this steak:
p190
aVWhat does this steak do for the fitness of an animal?
p191
aVWell, for a hungry lion looking to eat, it enhances fitness.
p192
aVFor a well-fed lion looking to mate, it doesn't enhance fitness.
p193
aVAnd for a rabbit in any state, it doesn't enhance fitness,
p194
aVso fitness does depend on reality as it is, yes,
p195
aVbut also on the organism, its state and its action.
p196
aVFitness is not the same thing as reality as it is,
p197
aVand it's fitness, and not reality as it is,
p198
aVthat figures centrally in the equations of evolution.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo, in my lab,
p201
aVwe have run hundreds of thousands of evolutionary game simulations
p202
aVwith lots of different randomly chosen worlds
p203
aVand organisms that compete for resources in those worlds.
p204
aVSome of the organisms see all of the reality,
p205
aVothers see just part of the reality,
p206
aVand some see none of the reality,
p207
aVonly fitness.
p208
aVWho wins?
p209
aa(lp210
VWell, I hate to break it to you, but perception of reality goes extinct.
p211
aVIn almost every simulation,
p212
aVorganisms that see none of reality
p213
aVbut are just tuned to fitness
p214
aVdrive to extinction all the organisms that perceive reality as it is.
p215
aVSo the bottom line is, evolution does not favor veridical,
p216
aVor accurate perceptions.
p217
aVThose perceptions of reality go extinct.
p218
aa(lp219
VNow, this is a bit stunning.
p220
aVHow can it be that not seeing the world accurately
p221
aVgives us a survival advantage?
p222
aVThat is a bit counterintuitive.
p223
aVBut remember the jewel beetle.
p224
aVThe jewel beetle survived for thousands, perhaps millions of years,
p225
aVusing simple tricks and hacks.
p226
aVWhat the equations of evolution are telling us
p227
aVis that all organisms, including us,  are in the same boat as the jewel beetle.
p228
aVWe do not see reality as it is.
p229
aVWe're shaped with tricks and hacks that keep us alive.
p230
aa(lp231
VStill,
p232
aVwe need some help with our intuitions.
p233
aVHow can not perceiving reality as it is be useful?
p234
aVWell, fortunately, we have a very helpful metaphor:
p235
aVthe desktop interface on your computer.
p236
aVConsider that blue icon for a TED Talk that you're writing.
p237
aVNow, the icon is blue and rectangular
p238
aVand in the lower right corner of the desktop.
p239
aVDoes that mean that the text file itself in the computer is blue,
p240
aVrectangular, and in the lower right-hand corner of the computer?
p241
aVOf course not.
p242
aVAnyone who thought that misinterprets the purpose of the interface.
p243
aVIt's not there to show you the reality of the computer.
p244
aVIn fact, it's there to hide that reality.
p245
aVYou don't want to know about the diodes
p246
aVand resistors and all the megabytes of software.
p247
aVIf you had to deal with that, you could never write your text file
p248
aVor edit your photo.
p249
aVSo the idea is that evolution has given us an interface
p250
aVthat hides reality and guides adaptive behavior.
p251
aVSpace and time, as you perceive them right now,
p252
aVare your desktop.
p253
aVPhysical objects are simply icons in that desktop.
p254
aa(lp255
VThere's an obvious objection.
p256
aVHoffman, if you think that train coming down the track at 200 MPH
p257
aVis just an icon of your desktop,
p258
aVwhy don't you step in front of it?
p259
aVAnd after you're gone, and your theory with you,
p260
aVwe'll know that there's more to that train than just an icon.
p261
aVWell, I wouldn't step in front of that train
p262
aVfor the same reason
p263
aVthat I wouldn't carelessly drag that icon to the trash can:
p264
aVnot because I take the icon literally \u2014
p265
aVthe file is not literally blue or rectangular \u2014
p266
aVbut I do take it seriously.
p267
aVI could lose weeks of work.
p268
aVSimilarly, evolution has shaped us
p269
aVwith perceptual symbols that are designed to keep us alive.
p270
aVWe'd better take them seriously.
p271
aVIf you see a snake, don't pick it up.
p272
aVIf you see a cliff, don't jump off.
p273
aVThey're designed to keep us safe, and we should take them seriously.
p274
aVThat does not mean that we should take them literally.
p275
aVThat's a logical error.
p276
aa(lp277
VAnother objection: There's nothing really new here.
p278
aVPhysicists have told us for a long time that the metal of that train looks solid
p279
aVbut really it's mostly empty space with microscopic particles zipping around.
p280
aVThere's nothing new here.
p281
aVWell, not exactly.
p282
aVIt's like saying, I know that that blue icon on the desktop
p283
aVis not the reality of the computer,
p284
aVbut if I pull out my trusty magnifying glass and look really closely,
p285
aVI see little pixels,
p286
aVand that's the reality of the computer.
p287
aVWell, not really \u2014 you're still on the desktop, and that's the point.
p288
aVThose microscopic particles are still in space and time:
p289
aVthey're still in the user interface.
p290
aVSo I'm saying something far more radical than those physicists.
p291
aa(lp292
VFinally, you might object,
p293
aVlook, we all see the train,
p294
aVtherefore none of us constructs the train.
p295
aVBut remember this example.
p296
aVIn this example, we all see a cube,
p297
aVbut the screen is flat,
p298
aVso the cube that you see is the cube that you construct.
p299
aVWe all see a cube
p300
aVbecause we all, each one of us, constructs the cube that we see.
p301
aVThe same is true of the train.
p302
aVWe all see a train because we each see the train that we construct,
p303
aVand the same is true of all physical objects.
p304
aa(lp305
VWe're inclined to think that perception is like a window on reality as it is.
p306
aVThe theory of evolution is telling us that this is an incorrect interpretation
p307
aVof our perceptions.
p308
aVInstead, reality is more like a 3D desktop
p309
aVthat's designed to hide the complexity of the real world
p310
aVand guide adaptive behavior.
p311
aVSpace as you perceive it is your desktop.
p312
aVPhysical objects are just the icons in that desktop.
p313
aa(lp314
VWe used to think that the Earth is flat because it looks that way.
p315
aVThen we thought that the Earth is the unmoving center of reality
p316
aVbecause it looks that way.
p317
aVWe were wrong.
p318
aVWe had misinterpreted our perceptions.
p319
aVNow we believe that spacetime and objects
p320
aVare the nature of reality as it is.
p321
aVThe theory of evolution is telling us that once again, we're wrong.
p322
aVWe're misinterpreting the content of our perceptual experiences.
p323
aVThere's something that exists when you don't look,
p324
aVbut it's not spacetime and physical objects.
p325
aVIt's as hard for us to let go of spacetime and objects
p326
aVas it is for the jewel beetle to let go of its bottle.
p327
aVWhy? Because we're blind to our own blindnesses.
p328
aVBut we have an advantage over the jewel beetle:
p329
aVour science and technology.
p330
aVBy peering through the lens of a telescope
p331
aVwe discovered that the Earth is not the unmoving center of reality,
p332
aVand by peering through the lens of the theory of evolution
p333
aVwe discovered that spacetime and objects
p334
aVare not the nature of reality.
p335
aVWhen I have a perceptual experience that I describe as a red tomato,
p336
aVI am interacting with reality,
p337
aVbut that reality is not a red tomato and is nothing like a red tomato.
p338
aVSimilarly, when I have an experience that I describe as a lion or a steak,
p339
aVI'm interacting with reality,
p340
aVbut that reality is not a lion or a steak.
p341
aVAnd here's the kicker:
p342
aVWhen I have a perceptual experience that I describe as a brain, or neurons,
p343
aVI am interacting with reality,
p344
aVbut that reality is not a brain or neurons
p345
aVand is nothing like a brain or neurons.
p346
aVAnd that reality, whatever it is,
p347
aVis the real source of cause and effect
p348
aVin the world \u2014 not brains, not neurons.
p349
aVBrains and neurons have no causal powers.
p350
aVThey cause none of our perceptual experiences,
p351
aVand none of our behavior.
p352
aVBrains and neurons are a species-specific set of symbols, a hack.
p353
aa(lp354
VWhat does this mean for the mystery of consciousness?
p355
aVWell, it opens up new possibilities.
p356
aVFor instance,
p357
aVperhaps reality is some vast machine that causes our conscious experiences.
p358
aVI doubt this, but it's worth exploring.
p359
aVPerhaps reality is some vast, interacting network of conscious agents,
p360
aVsimple and complex, that cause each other's conscious experiences.
p361
aVActually, this isn't as crazy an idea as it seems,
p362
aVand I'm currently exploring it.
p363
aa(lp364
VBut here's the point:
p365
aVOnce we let go of our massively intuitive
p366
aVbut massively false assumption about the nature of reality,
p367
aVit opens up new ways to think about life's greatest mystery.
p368
aVI bet that reality will end up turning out to be more fascinating
p369
aVand unexpected than we've ever imagined.
p370
aa(lp371
VThe theory of evolution presents us with the ultimate dare:
p372
aVDare to recognize that perception is not about seeing truth,
p373
aVit's about having kids.
p374
aVAnd by the way, even this TED is just in your head.
p375
aa(lp376
VThank you very much.
p377
aa(lp378
V(Applause)
p379
aa(lp380
VChris Anderson: If that's really you there, thank you.
p381
aVSo there's so much from this.
p382
aVI mean, first of all, some people may just be profoundly depressed
p383
aVat the thought that, if evolution does not favor reality,
p384
aVI mean, doesn't that to some extent undermine all our endeavors here,
p385
aVall our ability to think that we can think the truth,
p386
aVpossibly even including your own theory, if you go there?
p387
aa(lp388
VDonald Hoffman: Well, this does not stop us from a successful science.
p389
aVWhat we have is one theory that turned out to be false,
p390
aVthat perception is like reality and reality is like our perceptions.
p391
aVThat theory turns out to be false.
p392
aVOkay, throw that theory away.
p393
aVThat doesn't stop us from now postulating all sorts of other theories
p394
aVabout the nature of reality,
p395
aVso it's actually progress to recognize that one of our theories was false.
p396
aVSo science continues as normal. There's no problem here.
p397
aa(lp398
VCA: So you think it's possible \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p399
aVThis is cool, but what you're saying I think is it's possible that evolution
p400
aVcan still get you to reason.
p401
aa(lp402
VDH: Yes. Now that's a very, very good point.
p403
aVThe evolutionary game simulations that I showed were specifically about perception,
p404
aVand they do show that our perceptions have been shaped
p405
aVnot to show us reality as it is,
p406
aVbut that does not mean the same thing about our logic or mathematics.
p407
aVWe haven't done these simulations, but my bet is that we'll find
p408
aVthat there are some selection pressures for our logic and our mathematics
p409
aVto be at least in the direction of truth.
p410
aVI mean, if you're like me, math and logic is not easy.
p411
aVWe don't get it all right, but at least the selection pressures are not
p412
aVuniformly away from true math and logic.
p413
aVSo I think that we'll find that we have to look at each cognitive faculty
p414
aVone at a time and see what evolution does to it.
p415
aVWhat's true about perception may not be true about math and logic.
p416
aa(lp417
VCA: I mean, really what you're proposing is a kind of modern-day Bishop Berkeley
p418
aVinterpretation of the world:
p419
aVconsciousness causes matter, not the other way around.
p420
aa(lp421
VDH: Well, it's slightly different than Berkeley.
p422
aVBerkeley thought that, he was a deist, and he thought that the ultimate
p423
aVnature of reality is God and so forth,
p424
aVand I don't need to go where Berkeley's going,
p425
aVso it's quite a bit different from Berkeley.
p426
aVI call this conscious realism. It's actually a very different approach.
p427
aa(lp428
VCA: Don, I could literally talk with you for hours, and I hope to do that.
p429
aa(lp430
VThanks so much for that. DH: Thank you. (Applause)

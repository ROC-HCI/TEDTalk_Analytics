VSome years ago,
p5
aVI stumbled across a simple design exercise
p6
aVthat helps people understand and solve complex problems,
p7
aVand like many of these design exercises, it kind of seems trivial at first,
p8
aVbut under deep inspection,
p9
aVit turns out that it reveals unexpected truths
p10
aVabout the way that we collaborate and make sense of things.
p11
aa(lp12
VThe exercise has three parts
p13
aVand begins with something that we all know how to do,
p14
aVwhich is how to make toast.
p15
aVIt begins with a clean sheet of paper, a felt marker,
p16
aVand without using any words, you begin to draw how to make toast.
p17
aVAnd most people draw something like this.
p18
aVThey draw a loaf of bread,  which is sliced, then put into a toaster.
p19
aVThe toast is then deposited for some time.
p20
aVIt pops up, and then voila! After two minutes, toast and happiness.
p21
aa(lp22
VNow, over the years, I've collected many hundreds of drawings of these toasts,
p23
aVand some of them are very good,
p24
aVbecause they really illustrate the toast-making process quite clearly.
p25
aVAnd then there are some that are, well, not so good.
p26
aVThey really suck, actually, because you don't know what they're trying to say.
p27
aVUnder close inspection,
p28
aVsome reveal some aspects of toast-making while hiding others.
p29
aVSo there's some that are all about the toast,
p30
aVand all about the transformation of toast.
p31
aVAnd there's others that are all about the toaster,
p32
aVand the engineers love to draw the mechanics of this.
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVAnd then there are others that are about people.
p35
aVIt's about visualizing the experience that people have.
p36
aVAnd then there are others that are about the supply chain of making toast
p37
aVthat goes all the way back to the store.
p38
aVIt goes through the supply chain networks of teleportation
p39
aVand all the way back to the field and wheat,
p40
aVand one all actually goes all the way back to the Big Bang.
p41
aVSo it's crazy stuff.
p42
aVBut I think it's obvious
p43
aVthat even though these drawings are really wildly different,
p44
aVthey share a common quality, and I'm wondering if you can see it.
p45
aVDo you see it? What's common about these?
p46
aa(lp47
VMost drawings have nodes and links.
p48
aVSo nodes represent the tangible objects like the toaster and people,
p49
aVand links represent the connections between the nodes.
p50
aVAnd it's the combination of links and nodes
p51
aVthat produces a full systems model,
p52
aVand it makes our private mental models visible
p53
aVabout how we think something works.
p54
aVSo that's the value of these things.
p55
aVWhat's interesting about these systems models
p56
aVis how they reveal our various points of view.
p57
aVSo for example, Americans make toast with a toaster.
p58
aVThat seems obvious.
p59
aVWhereas many Europeans make toast with a frying pan, of course,
p60
aVand many students make toast with a fire.
p61
aVI don't really understand this. A lot of MBA students do this.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo you can measure the complexity by counting the number of nodes,
p64
aVand the average illustration has between four and eight nodes.
p65
aVLess than that, the drawing seems trivial,
p66
aVbut it's quick to understand,
p67
aVand more than 13, the drawing produces a feeling of map shock.
p68
aVIt's too complex.
p69
aVSo the sweet spot is between 5 and 13.
p70
aVSo if you want to communicate something visually,
p71
aVhave between five and 13 nodes in your diagram.
p72
aVSo though we may not be skilled at drawing,
p73
aVthe point is that we intuitively know how to break down complex things
p74
aVinto simple things and then  bring them back together again.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo this brings us to our second part of  the exercise,
p77
aVwhich is how to make toast,
p78
aVbut now with sticky notes or with cards.
p79
aVSo what happens then?
p80
aVWell, with cards, most people tend to draw clear, more detailed,
p81
aVand more logical nodes.
p82
aVYou can see the step by step analysis that takes place,
p83
aVand as they build up their model, they move their nodes around,
p84
aVrearranging them like Lego blocks.
p85
aVNow, though this might seem trivial, it's actually really important.
p86
aVThis rapid iteration of expressing and then reflecting and analyzing
p87
aVis really the only way in which we get clarity.
p88
aVIt's the essence of the design process.
p89
aVAnd systems theorists do tell us
p90
aVthat the ease with which we can change a representation
p91
aVcorrelates to our willingness to improve the model.
p92
aVSo sticky note systems are not only more fluid,
p93
aVthey generally produce way more nodes than static drawings.
p94
aVThe drawings are much richer.
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd this brings us to our third part of the exercise,
p97
aVwhich is to draw how to make toast, but this time in a group.
p98
aVSo what happens then?
p99
aVWell, here's what happens.
p100
aVIt starts out messy, and then it gets really messy,
p101
aVand then it gets messier,
p102
aVbut as people refine the models,
p103
aVthe best nodes become more prominent,
p104
aVand with each iteration, the model becomes clearer
p105
aVbecause people build on top of each other's ideas.
p106
aVWhat emerges is a unified systems model
p107
aVthat integrates the diversity of everyone's individual points of view,
p108
aVso that's a really different outcome
p109
aVfrom what usually happens  in meetings, isn't it?
p110
aVSo these drawings can contain 20 or more nodes,
p111
aVbut participants don't feel map shock
p112
aVbecause they participate in the building of their models themselves.
p113
aVNow, what's also really interesting, that the groups spontaneously mix
p114
aVand add additional layers of organization to it.
p115
aVTo deal with contradictions, for example,
p116
aVthey add branching patterns and parallel patterns.
p117
aVOh, and by the way, if they do it in complete silence,
p118
aVthey do it much better and much more quickly.
p119
aVReally interesting \u2014 talking gets in the way.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo here's some key lessons that can emerge from this.
p122
aVFirst, drawing helps us understand the situations
p123
aVas systems with nodes and their relationships.
p124
aVMovable cards produce better systems models,
p125
aVbecause we iterate much more fluidly.
p126
aVAnd then the group notes produce  the most comprehensive models
p127
aVbecause we synthesize several points of view.
p128
aVSo that's interesting.
p129
aVWhen people work together under the right circumstances,
p130
aVgroup models are much better than individual models.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo this approach works really great for drawing how to make toast,
p133
aVbut what if you wanted to draw something more relevant or pressing,
p134
aVlike your organizational vision, or customer experience,
p135
aVor long-term sustainability?
p136
aa(lp137
VThere's a visual revolution that's taking place
p138
aVas more organizations are addressing their wicked problems
p139
aVby collaboratively drawing them out.
p140
aVAnd I'm convinced that those who see their world as movable nodes and links
p141
aVreally have an edge.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd the practice is really pretty simple.
p144
aVYou start with a question, you collect the nodes,
p145
aVyou refine the nodes, you do it over again,
p146
aVyou refine and refine and refine, and the patterns emerge,
p147
aVand the group gets clarity and you answer the question.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo this simple act of visualizing and doing over and over again
p150
aVproduces some really remarkable outcomes.
p151
aVWhat's really important to know
p152
aVis that it's the conversations that are the important aspects,
p153
aVnot just the models themselves.
p154
aVAnd these visual frames of reference
p155
aVcan grow to several hundreds or even thousands of nodes.
p156
aVSo, one example is from an organization called Rodale.
p157
aVBig publishing company.
p158
aVThey lost a bunch of money one year,
p159
aVand their executive team for three days visualized their entire practice.
p160
aVAnd what's interesting is that after visualizing the entire business,
p161
aVsystems upon systems,
p162
aVthey reclaimed  50 million dollars of revenue,
p163
aVand they also moved from a D rating  to an A rating from their customers.
p164
aVWhy? Because there's alignment from the executive team.
p165
aVSo I'm now on a mission to help organizations
p166
aVsolve their wicked problems by using collaborative visualization,
p167
aVand on a site that I've produced called drawtoast.com,
p168
aVI've collected a bunch of best practices.
p169
aVand so you can learn how to run a workshop here,
p170
aVyou can learn more about the visual language
p171
aVand the structure of links and nodes that you can apply to general problem-solving,
p172
aVand download examples of various templates
p173
aVfor unpacking the thorny problems that we all face in our organizations.
p174
aVSo the seemingly trivial design exercise of drawing toast
p175
aVhelps us get clear, engaged and aligned.
p176
aa(lp177
VSo next time you're confronted with an interesting challenge,
p178
aVremember what design has to teach us.
p179
aVMake your ideas visible, tangible, and consequential.
p180
aVIt's simple, it's fun, it's powerful,
p181
aVand I believe it's an idea worth celebrating.
p182
aa(lp183
VThank you.

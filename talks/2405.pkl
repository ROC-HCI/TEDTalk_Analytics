VA few years ago,
p5
aVI got one of those spam emails.
p6
aVAnd it managed to get through my spam filter.
p7
aVI'm not quite sure how, but it turned up in my inbox,
p8
aVand it was from a guy called Solomon Odonkoh.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VI know.
p13
aa(lp14
V(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VIt went like this:
p17
aVit said, "Hello James Veitch,
p18
aVI have an interesting business proposal I want to share with you, Solomon."
p19
aVNow, my hand was kind of hovering on the delete button, right?
p20
aVI was looking at my phone. I thought, I could just delete this.
p21
aVOr I could do what I think we've all always wanted to do.
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd I said, "Solomon, Your email intrigues me."
p26
aa(lp27
V(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
V(Applause)
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd the game was afoot.
p32
aa(lp33
VHe said, "Dear James Veitch, We shall be shipping Gold to you."
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
V"You will earn 10% of any gold you distributes."
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VSo I knew I was dealing with a professional.
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VI said, "How much is it worth?"
p46
aa(lp47
VHe said, "We will start with smaller quantity," \u2014
p48
aVI was like, aww \u2014
p49
aVand then he said, "of 25 kgs.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VThe worth should be about $2.5 million."
p54
aa(lp55
VI said, "Solomon, if we're going to do it, let's go big.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Applause)
p58
aa(lp59
VI can handle it. How much gold do you have?"
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
VHe said, "It is not a matter of how much gold I have,
p64
aVwhat matters is your capability of handling.
p65
aVWe can start with 50 kgs as trial shipment."
p66
aa(lp67
VI said, "50 kgs?
p68
aVThere's no point doing this at all
p69
aVunless you're shipping at least a metric ton."
p70
aa(lp71
V(Laughter)
p72
aa(lp73
V(Applause)
p74
aa(lp75
VHe said, "What do you do for a living?"
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VI said, "I'm a hedge fund executive bank manager."
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VThis isn't the first time I've shipped bullion, my friend,
p84
aVno no no.
p85
aa(lp86
VThen I started to panic.
p87
aVI was like, "Where are you based?"
p88
aVI don't know about you,
p89
aVbut I think if we're going via the postal service,
p90
aVit ought to be signed for.
p91
aVThat's a lot of gold."
p92
aa(lp93
VHe said, "It will not be easy to convince my company
p94
aVto do larger quantity shipment."
p95
aa(lp96
VI said, "Solomon, I'm completely with you on this one.
p97
aVI'm putting together a visual for you to take into the board meeting.
p98
aVHold tight."
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VThis is what I sent Solomon.
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
V(Applause)
p107
aa(lp108
VI don't know if we have any statisticians in the house,
p109
aVbut there's definitely something going on.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VI said, "Solomon, attached to this email you'll find a helpful chart.
p114
aVI've had one of my assistants run the numbers.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
VWe're ready for shipping as much gold as possible."
p119
aa(lp120
VThere's always a moment where they try to tug your heartstrings,
p121
aVand this was it for Solomon.
p122
aVHe said, "I will be so much happy if the deal goes well,
p123
aVbecause I'm going to get a very good commission as well."
p124
aVAnd I said, "That's amazing, What are you going to spend your cut on?"
p125
aVAnd he said, "On RealEstate, what about you?"
p126
aa(lp127
VI thought about it for a long time.
p128
aVAnd I said, "One word;
p129
aVHummus."
p130
aa(lp131
V(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
V"It's going places.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VI was in Sainsbury's the other day
p138
aVand there were like 30 different varieties.
p139
aVAlso you can cut up carrots, and you can dip them.
p140
aVHave you ever done that, Solomon?"
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VHe said, "I have to go bed now."
p145
aa(lp146
V(Laughter)
p147
aa(lp148
V(Applause)
p149
aa(lp150
V"Till morrow.
p151
aVHave sweet dream."
p152
aa(lp153
VI didn't know what to say!
p154
aVI said, "Bonsoir my golden nugget, bonsoir."
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VGuys, you have to understand, this had been going for, like, weeks,
p159
aValbeit hitherto the greatest weeks of my life,
p160
aVbut I had to knock it on the head.
p161
aVIt was getting a bit out of hand.
p162
aVFriends were saying, "James, do you want to come for a drink?"
p163
aVI was like, "I can't, I'm expecting an email about some gold."
p164
aa(lp165
VSo I figured I had to knock it on the head.
p166
aVI had to take it to a ridiculous conclusion.
p167
aVSo I concocted a plan.
p168
aVI said, "Solomon, I'm concerned about security.
p169
aVWhen we email each other,
p170
aVwe need to use a code."
p171
aVAnd he agreed.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
VI said, "Solomon, I spent all night coming up with this code
p176
aVwe need to use in all further correspondence:
p177
aa(lp178
VLawyer: Gummy Bear.
p179
aa(lp180
VBank: Cream Egg.
p181
aa(lp182
VLegal: Fizzy Cola Bottle. Claim: Peanut M&Ms.
p183
aa(lp184
VDocuments: Jelly Beans.
p185
aa(lp186
VWestern Union: A Giant Gummy Lizard."
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
VI knew these were all words they use, right?
p191
aVI said, "Please call me Kitkat in all further correspondence."
p192
aa(lp193
V(Laughter)
p194
aa(lp195
VI didn't hear back. I thought, I've gone too far.
p196
aVI've gone too far. So I had to backpedal a little.
p197
aVI said, "Solomon, Is the deal still on?
p198
aVKitKat."
p199
aa(lp200
V(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
VBecause you have to be consistent.
p203
aVThen I did get an email back from him.
p204
aVHe said, "The Business is on and I am trying to blah blah blah ..."
p205
aa(lp206
VI said, "Dude, you have to use the code!"
p207
aVWhat followed is the greatest email I've ever received.
p208
aa(lp209
V(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
VI'm not joking, this is what turned up in my inbox.
p212
aVThis was a good day.
p213
aV"The business is on.
p214
aVI am trying to raise the balance for the Gummy Bear \u2014
p215
aa(lp216
V(Laughter)
p217
aa(lp218
Vso he can submit all the needed Fizzy Cola Bottle Jelly Beans
p219
aVto the Creme Egg,
p220
aVfor the Peanut M&Ms process to start.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VSend 1,500 pounds
p225
aVvia a Giant Gummy Lizard."
p226
aa(lp227
V(Applause)
p228
aa(lp229
VAnd that was so much fun, right,
p230
aVthat it got me thinking:
p231
aVlike, what would happen if I just spent as much time as could
p232
aVreplying to as many scam emails as I could?
p233
aVAnd that's what I've been doing
p234
aVfor three years
p235
aVon your behalf.
p236
aa(lp237
V(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
V(Applause)
p240
aa(lp241
VCrazy stuff happens when you start replying to scam emails.
p242
aVIt's really difficult,
p243
aVand I highly recommend we do it.
p244
aVI don't think what I'm doing is mean.
p245
aVThere are a lot of people who do mean things to scammers.
p246
aVAll I'm doing is wasting their time.
p247
aVAnd I think any time they're spending with me
p248
aVis time they're not spending scamming vulnerable adults
p249
aVout of their savings, right?
p250
aa(lp251
VAnd if you're going to do this \u2014 and I highly recommend you do \u2014
p252
aVget yourself a pseudonymous email address.
p253
aVDon't use your own email address.
p254
aVThat's what I was doing at the start and it was a nightmare.
p255
aVI'd wake up in the morning and have a thousand emails
p256
aVabout penis enlargements,
p257
aVonly one of which was a legitimate response \u2014
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
Vto a medical question I had.
p262
aa(lp263
VBut I'll tell you what, though, guys,
p264
aVI'll tell you what: any day is a good day, any day is a good day
p265
aVif you receive an email that begins like this:
p266
aa(lp267
V(Laughter)
p268
aa(lp269
V"I AM WINNIE MANDELA,
p270
aVTHE SECOND WIFE OF NELSON MANDELA THE FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT."
p271
aVI was like, oh! \u2014 that Winnie Mandela.
p272
aa(lp273
V(Laughter)
p274
aa(lp275
VI know so many.
p276
aa(lp277
V"I NEED TO TRANSFER 45 MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE COUNTRY
p278
aVBECAUSE OF MY HUSBAND NELSON MANDELA'S HEALTH CONDITION."
p279
aa(lp280
VLet that sink in.
p281
aVShe sent me this, which is hysterical.
p282
aa(lp283
V(Laughter)
p284
aa(lp285
VAnd this.
p286
aVAnd this looks fairly legitimate, this is a letter of authorization.
p287
aVBut to be honest, if there's nothing written on it, it's just a shape!
p288
aa(lp289
V(Laughter)
p290
aa(lp291
VI said, "Winnie, I'm really sorry to hear of this.
p292
aVGiven that Nelson died three months ago,
p293
aVI'd describe his health condition as fairly serious."
p294
aa(lp295
V(Laughter)
p296
aa(lp297
VThat's the worst health condition you can have, not being alive.
p298
aa(lp299
VShe said, "KINDLY COMPLY WITH MY BANKERS INSTRUCTIONS.
p300
aVONE LOVE."
p301
aa(lp302
V(Laughter)
p303
aa(lp304
VI said, "Of course. NO WOMAN, NO CRY."
p305
aa(lp306
V(Laughter)
p307
aa(lp308
V(Applause)
p309
aa(lp310
VShe said, "MY BANKER WILL NEED TRANSFER OF 3000 DOLLARS. ONE LOVE."
p311
aa(lp312
V(Laughter)
p313
aa(lp314
VI said, "no problemo.
p315
aa(lp316
VI SHOT THE SHERIFF."
p317
aa(lp318
V[ (BUT I DID NOT SHOOT THE DEPUTY) ]
p319
aa(lp320
V(Laughter)
p321
aa(lp322
VThank you.
p323
aa(lp324
V(Applause)

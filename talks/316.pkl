VSo I'm going to talk today about collecting stories
p5
aVin some unconventional ways.
p6
aVThis is a picture of me from a very awkward stage in my life.
p7
aVYou might enjoy the awkwardly tight, cut-off pajama bottoms with balloons.
p8
aVAnyway, it was a time when I was mainly interested
p9
aVin collecting imaginary stories.
p10
aVSo this is a picture of me
p11
aVholding one of the first watercolor paintings I ever made.
p12
aVAnd recently I've been much more interested in collecting stories
p13
aVfrom reality \u2014 so, real stories.
p14
aVAnd specifically, I'm interested in collecting my own stories,
p15
aVstories from the Internet, and then recently, stories from life,
p16
aVwhich is kind of a new area of work that I've been doing recently.
p17
aVSo I'll be talking about each of those today.
p18
aVSo, first of all, my own stories. These are two of my sketchbooks.
p19
aVI have many of these books,
p20
aVand I've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years.
p21
aVThey accompany me wherever I go in my life,
p22
aVand I fill them with all sorts of things,
p23
aVrecords of my lived experience:
p24
aVso watercolor paintings, drawings of what I see,
p25
aVdead flowers, dead insects, pasted ticket stubs, rusting coins,
p26
aVbusiness cards, writings.
p27
aVAnd in these books, you can find these short, little glimpses
p28
aVof moments and experiences and people that I meet.
p29
aVAnd, you know, after keeping these books for a number of years,
p30
aVI started to become very interested in collecting
p31
aVnot only my own personal artifacts,
p32
aVbut also the artifacts of other people.
p33
aVSo, I started collecting found objects.
p34
aVThis is a photograph I found lying in a gutter in New York City
p35
aVabout 10 years ago.
p36
aVOn the front, you can see the tattered black-and-white photo of a woman's face,
p37
aVand on the back it says, "To Judy, the girl with the Bill Bailey voice.
p38
aVHave fun in whatever you do."
p39
aVAnd I really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life.
p40
aVAs opposed to knowing the whole story, just knowing a little bit of the story,
p41
aVand then letting your own mind fill in the rest.
p42
aVAnd that idea of a partial glimpse is something
p43
aVthat will come back in a lot of the work I'll be showing later today.
p44
aVSo, around this time I was studying computer science at Princeton University,
p45
aVand I noticed that it was suddenly possible
p46
aVto collect these sorts of personal artifacts,
p47
aVnot just from street corners, but also from the Internet.
p48
aVAnd that suddenly, people, en masse, were leaving scores and scores
p49
aVof digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives.
p50
aVBlog posts, photographs, thoughts, feelings, opinions,
p51
aVall of these things were being expressed by people online,
p52
aVand leaving behind trails.
p53
aVSo, I started to write computer programs
p54
aVthat study very, very large sets of these online footprints.
p55
aVOne such project is about a year and a half old.
p56
aVIt's called "We Feel Fine."
p57
aVThis is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entries
p58
aVevery two or three minutes, searching for occurrences of the phrases
p59
aV"I feel" and "I am feeling." And when it finds one of those phrases,
p60
aVit grabs the full sentence up to the period
p61
aVand also tries to identify demographic information about the author.
p62
aVSo, their gender, their age, their geographic location
p63
aVand what the weather conditions were like when they wrote that sentence.
p64
aVIt collects about 20,000 such sentences a day
p65
aVand it's been running for about a year and a half,
p66
aVhaving collected over 10 and a half million feelings now.
p67
aVThis is, then, how they're presented.
p68
aVThese dots here represent some of the English-speaking world's
p69
aVfeelings from the last few hours,
p70
aVeach dot being a single sentence stated by a single blogger.
p71
aVAnd the color of each dot corresponds to the type of feeling inside,
p72
aVso the bright ones are happy, and the dark ones are sad.
p73
aVAnd the diameter of each dot corresponds
p74
aVto the length of the sentence inside.
p75
aVSo the small ones are short, and the bigger ones are longer.
p76
aV"I feel fine with the body I'm in, there'll be no easy excuse
p77
aVfor why I still feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend,"
p78
aVfrom a twenty-two-year-old in Japan.
p79
aV"I got this on some trading locally,
p80
aVbut really don't feel like screwing with wiring and crap."
p81
aVAlso, some of the feelings contain photographs in the blog posts.
p82
aVAnd when that happens, these montage compositions are automatically created,
p83
aVwhich consist of the sentence and images being combined.
p84
aVAnd any of these can be opened up to reveal the sentence inside.
p85
aV"I feel good."
p86
aV"I feel rough now, and I probably gained 100,000 pounds,
p87
aVbut it was worth it."
p88
aV"I love how they were able to preserve most in everything
p89
aVthat makes you feel close to nature \u2014 butterflies,
p90
aVman-made forests, limestone caves and hey, even a huge python."
p91
aVSo the next movement is called mobs.
p92
aVThis provides a slightly more statistical look at things.
p93
aVThis is showing the world's most common feelings overall right now,
p94
aVdominated by better, then bad, then good, then guilty, and so on.
p95
aVWeather causes the feelings to assume the physical traits
p96
aVof the weather they represent. So the sunny ones swirl around,
p97
aVthe cloudy ones float along, the rainy ones fall down,
p98
aVand the snowy ones flutter to the ground.
p99
aVYou can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside.
p100
aVFinally, location causes the feelings to move to their spots
p101
aVon a world map, giving you a sense of their geographic distribution.
p102
aVSo I'll show you now some of my favorite montages from "We Feel Fine."
p103
aVThese are the images that are automatically constructed.
p104
aV"I feel like I'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe."
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aV"I've kissed numerous other boys and it hasn't felt good,
p107
aVthe kisses felt messy and wrong,
p108
aVbut kissing Lucas feels beautiful and almost spiritual."
p109
aV"I can feel my cancer grow."
p110
aV"I feel pretty."
p111
aV"I feel skinny, but I'm not."
p112
aV"I'm 23, and a recovering meth and heroin addict,
p113
aVand feel absolutely blessed to still be alive."
p114
aV"I can't wait to see them racing for the first time at Daytona next month,
p115
aVbecause I feel the need for speed."
p116
aV(Laughter)
p117
aV"I feel sassy."
p118
aV"I feel so sexy in this new wig."
p119
aVAs you can see, "We Feel Fine" collects
p120
aVvery, very small-scale personal stories.
p121
aVSometimes, stories as short as two or three words.
p122
aVSo, really even challenging the notion
p123
aVof what can be considered a story.
p124
aVAnd recently, I've become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story.
p125
aVAnd that's led me to doing some work with the physical world,
p126
aVnot with the Internet,
p127
aVand only using the Internet at the very last moment, as a presentation medium.
p128
aVSo these are some newer projects that
p129
aVactually aren't even launched publicly yet.
p130
aVThe first such one is called "The Whale Hunt."
p131
aVLast May, I spent nine days living up in Barrow, Alaska,
p132
aVthe northernmost settlement in the United States,
p133
aVwith a family of Inupiat Eskimos,
p134
aVdocumenting their annual spring whale hunt.
p135
aVThis is the whaling camp here, we're about six miles from shore,
p136
aVcamping on five and a half feet of thick, frozen pack ice.
p137
aVAnd that water that you see there is the open lead,
p138
aVand through that lead, bowhead whales migrate north each springtime.
p139
aVAnd the Eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here,
p140
aVwaits for a whale to come close enough to attack. And when it does,
p141
aVit throws a harpoon at it, and then hauls the whale up
p142
aVunder the ice, and cuts it up.
p143
aVAnd that would provide the community's food supply for a long time.
p144
aVSo I went up there, and I lived with these guys
p145
aVout in their whaling camp here, and photographed the entire experience,
p146
aVbeginning with the taxi ride to Newark airport in New York,
p147
aVand ending with the butchering of the second whale, seven and a half days later.
p148
aVI photographed that entire experience at five-minute intervals.
p149
aVSo every five minutes, I took a photograph.
p150
aVWhen I was awake, with the camera around my neck.
p151
aVWhen I was sleeping, with a tripod and a timer.
p152
aVAnd then in moments of high adrenaline,
p153
aVlike when something exciting was happening,
p154
aVI would up that photographic frequency to as many as
p155
aV37 photographs in five minutes.
p156
aVSo what this created was a photographic heartbeat
p157
aVthat sped up and slowed down, more or less matching
p158
aVthe changing pace of my own heartbeat.
p159
aVThat was the first concept here.
p160
aVThe second concept was to use this experience to think about
p161
aVthe fundamental components of any story.
p162
aVWhat are the things that make up a story?
p163
aVSo, stories have characters. Stories have concepts.
p164
aVStories take place in a certain area. They have contexts.
p165
aVThey have colors. What do they look like?
p166
aVThey have time. When did it take place? Dates \u2014 when did it occur?
p167
aVAnd in the case of the whale hunt, also this idea of an excitement level.
p168
aVThe thing about stories, though, in most of the existing mediums
p169
aVthat we're accustomed to \u2014 things like novels, radio,
p170
aVphotographs, movies, even lectures like this one \u2014
p171
aVwe're very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position,
p172
aVsome kind of omniscient, external body
p173
aVthrough whose eyes you see the story.
p174
aVWe're very used to this.
p175
aVBut if you think about real life, it's not like that at all.
p176
aVI mean, in real life, things are much more nuanced and complex,
p177
aVand there's all of these overlapping stories
p178
aVintersecting and touching each other.
p179
aVAnd so I thought it would be interesting to build a framework
p180
aVto surface those types of stories. So, in the case of "The Whale Hunt,"
p181
aVhow could we extract something like the story of Simeon and Crawford,
p182
aVinvolving the concepts of wildlife, tools and blood, taking place on the Arctic Ocean,
p183
aVdominated by the color red, happening around 10 a.m. on May 3,
p184
aVwith an excitement level of high?
p185
aVSo, how to extract this order of narrative from this larger story?
p186
aVI built a web interface for viewing "The Whale Hunt" that attempts to do just this.
p187
aVSo these are all 3,214 pictures taken up there.
p188
aVThis is my studio in Brooklyn. This is the Arctic Ocean,
p189
aVand the butchering of the second whale, seven days later.
p190
aVYou can start to see some of the story here, told by color.
p191
aVSo this red strip signifies the color of the wallpaper
p192
aVin the basement apartment where I was staying.
p193
aVAnd things go white as we move out onto the Arctic Ocean.
p194
aVIntroduction of red down here, when whales are being cut up.
p195
aVYou can see a timeline, showing you the exciting moments throughout the story.
p196
aVThese are organized chronologically.
p197
aVWheel provides a slightly more playful version of the same,
p198
aVso these are also all the photographs organized chronologically.
p199
aVAnd any of these can be clicked,
p200
aVand then the narrative is entered at that position.
p201
aVSo here I am sleeping on the airplane heading up to Alaska.
p202
aVThat's "Moby Dick."
p203
aVThis is the food we ate.
p204
aVThis is in the Patkotak's family living room
p205
aVin their house in Barrow. The boxed wine they served us.
p206
aVCigarette break outside \u2014 I don't smoke.
p207
aVThis is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping.
p208
aVThis is out at whale camp, on the Arctic Ocean.
p209
aVThis graph that I'm clicking down here is meant to be
p210
aVreminiscent of a medical heartbeat graph,
p211
aVshowing the exciting moments of adrenaline.
p212
aVThis is the ice starting to freeze over. The snow fence they built.
p213
aVAnd so what I'll show you now is the ability to pull out sub-stories.
p214
aVSo, here you see the cast. These are all of the people in "The Whale Hunt"
p215
aVand the two whales that were killed down here.
p216
aVAnd we could do something as arbitrary as, say,
p217
aVextract the story of Rony, involving the concepts of blood
p218
aVand whales and tools, taking place on the Arctic Ocean,
p219
aVat Ahkivgaq camp, with the heartbeat level of fast.
p220
aVAnd now we've whittled down that whole story
p221
aVto just 29 matching photographs,
p222
aVand then we can enter the narrative at that position.
p223
aVAnd you can see Rony cutting up the whale here.
p224
aVThese whales are about 40 feet long,
p225
aVand weighing over 40 tons. And they provide the food source
p226
aVfor the community for much of the year.
p227
aVSkipping ahead a bit more here, this is Rony on the whale carcass.
p228
aVThey use no chainsaws or anything; it's entirely just blades,
p229
aVand an incredibly efficient process.
p230
aVThis is the guys on the rope, pulling open the carcass.
p231
aVThis is the muktuk, or the blubber, all lined up for community distribution.
p232
aVIt's baleen. Moving on.
p233
aVSo what I'm going to tell you about next
p234
aVis a very new thing. It's not even a project yet.
p235
aVSo, just yesterday, I flew in here from Singapore, and before that,
p236
aVI was spending two weeks in Bhutan, the small Himalayan kingdom
p237
aVnestled between Tibet and India.
p238
aVAnd I was doing a project there about happiness,
p239
aVinterviewing a lot of local people.
p240
aVSo Bhutan has this really wacky thing where they base
p241
aVmost of their high-level governmental decisions around the concept
p242
aVof gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product,
p243
aVand they've been doing this since the '70s.
p244
aVAnd it leads to just a completely different value system.
p245
aVIt's an incredibly non-materialistic culture,
p246
aVwhere people don't have a lot, but they're incredibly happy.
p247
aVSo I went around and I talked to people about some of these ideas.
p248
aVSo, I did a number of things. I asked people a number of set questions,
p249
aVand took a number of set photographs,
p250
aVand interviewed them with audio, and also took pictures.
p251
aVI would start by asking people to rate their happiness
p252
aVbetween one and 10, which is kind of inherently absurd.
p253
aVAnd then when they answered, I would inflate that number of balloons
p254
aVand give them that number of balloons to hold.
p255
aVSo, you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons,
p256
aVand some really sad soul holding one balloon.
p257
aVBut you know, even holding one balloon is like, kind of happy.
p258
aV(Laughter)
p259
aVAnd then I would ask them a number of questions like
p260
aVwhat was the happiest day in their life, what makes them happy.
p261
aVAnd then finally, I would ask them to make a wish.
p262
aVAnd when they made a wish, I would write their wish
p263
aVonto one of the balloons and take a picture of them holding it.
p264
aVSo I'm going to show you now just a few brief snippets
p265
aVof some of the interviews that I did, some of the people I spoke with.
p266
aVThis is an 11-year-old student.
p267
aVHe was playing cops and robbers with his friends, running around town,
p268
aVand they all had plastic toy guns.
p269
aVHis wish was to become a police officer.
p270
aVHe was getting started early. Those were his hands.
p271
aVI took pictures of everybody's hands,
p272
aVbecause I think you can often tell a lot about somebody
p273
aVfrom how their hands look. I took a portrait of everybody,
p274
aVand asked everybody to make a funny face.
p275
aVA 17-year-old student. Her wish was to have been born a boy.
p276
aVShe thinks that women have a pretty tough go of things in Bhutan,
p277
aVand it's a lot easier if you're a boy.
p278
aVA 28-year-old cell phone shop owner.
p279
aVIf you knew what Paro looked like, you'd understand
p280
aVhow amazing it is that there's a cell phone shop there.
p281
aVHe wanted to help poor people.
p282
aVA 53-year-old farmer. She was chaffing wheat,
p283
aVand that pile of wheat behind her
p284
aVhad taken her about a week to make.
p285
aVShe wanted to keep farming until she dies.
p286
aVYou can really start to see the stories told by the hands here.
p287
aVShe was wearing this silver ring that had the word "love" engraved on it,
p288
aVand she'd found it in the road somewhere.
p289
aVA 16-year-old quarry worker.
p290
aVThis guy was breaking rocks with a hammer in the hot sunlight,
p291
aVbut he just wanted to spend his life as a farmer.
p292
aVA 21-year-old monk. He was very happy.
p293
aVHe wanted to live a long life at the monastery.
p294
aVHe had this amazing series of hairs growing out of a mole on the left side of his face,
p295
aVwhich I'm told is very good luck.
p296
aVHe was kind of too shy to make a funny face.
p297
aVA 16-year-old student.
p298
aVShe wanted to become an independent woman.
p299
aVI asked her about that, and she said she meant
p300
aVthat she doesn't want to be married,
p301
aVbecause, in her opinion, when you get married in Bhutan as a woman,
p302
aVyour chances to live an independent life kind of end,
p303
aVand so she had no interest in that.
p304
aVA 24-year-old truck driver.
p305
aVThere are these terrifyingly huge Indian trucks
p306
aVthat come careening around one-lane roads with two-lane traffic,
p307
aVwith 3,000-foot drop-offs right next to the road,
p308
aVand he was driving one of these trucks.
p309
aVBut all he wanted was to just live a comfortable life, like other people.
p310
aVA 24-year-old road sweeper. I caught her on her lunch break.
p311
aVShe'd built a little fire to keep warm, right next to the road.
p312
aVHer wish was to marry someone with a car.
p313
aVShe wanted a change in her life.
p314
aVShe lives in a little worker's camp right next to the road,
p315
aVand she wanted a different lot on things.
p316
aVAn 81-year-old itinerant farmer.
p317
aVI saw this guy on the side of the road,
p318
aVand he actually doesn't have a home.
p319
aVHe travels from farm to farm each day trying to find work,
p320
aVand then he tries to sleep at whatever farm he gets work at.
p321
aVSo his wish was to come with me, so that he had somewhere to live.
p322
aVHe had this amazing knife that he pulled out of his gho
p323
aVand started brandishing when I asked him to make a funny face.
p324
aVIt was all good-natured.
p325
aVA 10-year-old.
p326
aVHe wanted to join a school and learn to read,
p327
aVbut his parents didn't have enough money to send him to school.
p328
aVHe was eating this orange, sugary candy
p329
aVthat he kept dipping his fingers into,
p330
aVand since there was so much saliva on his hands,
p331
aVthis orange paste started to form on his palms.
p332
aV(Laughter)
p333
aVA 37-year-old road worker.
p334
aVOne of the more touchy political subjects in Bhutan
p335
aVis the use of Indian cheap labor
p336
aVthat they import from India to build the roads,
p337
aVand then they send these people home once the roads are built.
p338
aVSo these guys were in a worker's gang
p339
aVmixing up asphalt one morning on the side of the highway.
p340
aVHis wish was to make some money and open a store.
p341
aVA 75-year-old farmer. She was selling oranges on the side of the road.
p342
aVI asked her about her wish, and she said,
p343
aV"You know, maybe I'll live, maybe I'll die, but I don't have a wish."
p344
aVShe was chewing betel nut, which caused her teeth
p345
aVover the years to turn very red.
p346
aVFinally, this is a 26-year-old nun I spoke to.
p347
aVHer wish was to make a pilgrimage to Tibet.
p348
aVI asked her how long she planned to live in the nunnery and she said,
p349
aV"Well, you know, of course, it's impermanent,
p350
aVbut my plan is to live here until I'm 30, and then enter a hermitage."
p351
aVAnd I said, "You mean, like a cave?" And she said, "Yeah, like a cave."
p352
aVAnd I said, "Wow, and how long will you live in the cave?"
p353
aVAnd she said, "Well, you know,
p354
aVI think I'd kind of like to live my whole life in the cave."
p355
aVI just thought that was amazing. I mean, she spoke in a way \u2014
p356
aVwith amazing English, and amazing humor, and amazing laughter \u2014
p357
aVthat made her seem like somebody I could have bumped into
p358
aVon the streets of New York, or in Vermont, where I'm from.
p359
aVBut here she had been living in a nunnery for the last seven years.
p360
aVI asked her a little bit more about the cave
p361
aVand what she planned would happen once she went there, you know.
p362
aVWhat if she saw the truth after just one year,
p363
aVwhat would she do for the next 35 years in her life?
p364
aVAnd this is what she said.
p365
aVWoman: I think I'm going to stay for 35. Maybe \u2014 maybe I'll die.
p366
aVJonathan Harris: Maybe you'll die? Woman: Yes.
p367
aVJH: 10 years? Woman: Yes, yes. JH: 10 years, that's a long time.
p368
aVWoman: Yes, not maybe one, 10 years, maybe I can die
p369
aVwithin one year, or something like that.
p370
aVJH: Are you hoping to?
p371
aVWoman: Ah, because you know, it's impermanent.
p372
aVJH: Yeah, but \u2014 yeah, OK. Do you hope \u2014
p373
aVwould you prefer to live in the cave for 40 years,
p374
aVor to live for one year?
p375
aVWoman: But I prefer for maybe 40 to 50.
p376
aVJH: 40 to 50? Yeah.
p377
aVWoman: Yes. From then, I'm going to the heaven.
p378
aVJH: Well, I wish you the best of luck with it.
p379
aVWoman: Thank you.
p380
aVJH: I hope it's everything that you hope it will be.
p381
aVSo thank you again, so much.
p382
aVWoman: You're most welcome.
p383
aVJH: So if you caught that, she said she hoped to die
p384
aVwhen she was around 40. That was enough life for her.
p385
aVSo, the last thing we did, very quickly,
p386
aVis I took all those wish balloons \u2014 there were 117 interviews,
p387
aV117 wishes \u2014 and I brought them up to a place called Dochula,
p388
aVwhich is a mountain pass in Bhutan, at 10,300 feet,
p389
aVone of the more sacred places in Bhutan.
p390
aVAnd up there, there are thousands of prayer flags
p391
aVthat people have spread out over the years.
p392
aVAnd we re-inflated all of the balloons, put them up on a string,
p393
aVand hung them up there among the prayer flags.
p394
aVAnd they're actually still flying up there today.
p395
aVSo if any of you have any Bhutan travel plans in the near future,
p396
aVyou can go check these out. Here are some images from that.
p397
aVWe said a Buddhist prayer so that all these wishes could come true.
p398
aVYou can start to see some familiar balloons here.
p399
aV"To make some money and to open a store" was the Indian road worker.
p400
aVThanks very much.

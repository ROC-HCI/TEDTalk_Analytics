VIf your life were a book
p5
aVand you were the author,
p6
aVhow would you want your story to go?
p7
aVThat's the question that changed my life forever.
p8
aVGrowing up in the hot Last Vegas desert,
p9
aVall I wanted was to be free.
p10
aVI would daydream about traveling the world,
p11
aVliving in a place where it snowed,
p12
aVand I would picture all of the stories
p13
aVthat I would go on to tell.
p14
aa(lp15
VAt the age of 19,
p16
aVthe day after I graduated high school,
p17
aVI moved to a place where it snowed
p18
aVand I became a massage therapist.
p19
aVWith this job all I needed were my hands
p20
aVand my massage table by my side
p21
aVand I could go anywhere.
p22
aVFor the first time in my life,
p23
aVI felt free, independent
p24
aVand completely in control of my life.
p25
aVThat is, until my life took a detour.
p26
aVI went home from work early one day
p27
aVwith what I thought was the flu,
p28
aVand less than 24 hours later
p29
aVI was in the hospital
p30
aVon life support
p31
aVwith less than a two percent chance of living.
p32
aVIt wasn't until days later
p33
aVas I lay in a coma
p34
aVthat the doctors diagnosed me
p35
aVwith bacterial meningitis,
p36
aVa vaccine-preventable blood infection.
p37
aVOver the course of two and a half months
p38
aVI lost my spleen, my kidneys,
p39
aVthe hearing in my left ear
p40
aVand both of my legs below the knee.
p41
aa(lp42
VWhen my parents wheeled me out of the hospital
p43
aVI felt like I had been pieced back together
p44
aVlike a patchwork doll.
p45
aVI thought the worst was over
p46
aVuntil weeks later when I saw my new legs
p47
aVfor the first time.
p48
aVThe calves were bulky blocks of metal
p49
aVwith pipes bolted together for the ankles
p50
aVand a yellow rubber foot
p51
aVwith a raised rubber line from the toe to the ankle
p52
aVto look like a vein.
p53
aVI didn't know what to expect,
p54
aVbut I wasn't expecting that.
p55
aa(lp56
VWith my mom by my side
p57
aVand tears streaming down our faces,
p58
aVI strapped on these chunky legs
p59
aVand I stood up.
p60
aVThey were so painful and so confining
p61
aVthat all I could think was,
p62
aVhow am I ever going to travel the world
p63
aVin these things?
p64
aVHow was I ever going to live
p65
aVthe life full of adventure and stories,
p66
aVas I always wanted?
p67
aVAnd how was I going to snowboard again?
p68
aa(lp69
VThat day, I went home, I crawled into bed
p70
aVand this is what my life looked like
p71
aVfor the next few months:
p72
aVme passed out, escaping from reality,
p73
aVwith my legs resting by my side.
p74
aVI was absolutely physically and emotionally broken.
p75
aa(lp76
VBut I knew that in order to move forward,
p77
aVI had to let go of the old Amy
p78
aVand learn to embrace the new Amy.
p79
aVAnd that is when it dawned on me
p80
aVthat I didn't have to be five-foot-five anymore.
p81
aVI could be as tall as I wanted!
p82
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p83
aVOr as short as I wanted, depending on who I was dating.
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aVAnd if I snowboarded again,
p86
aVmy feet aren't going to get cold.
p87
aV(Laughter)
p88
aVAnd best of all, I thought,
p89
aVI can make my feet the size of all the shoes
p90
aVthat are on the sales rack. (Laughter)
p91
aVAnd I did!
p92
aVSo there were benefits here.
p93
aa(lp94
VIt was this moment that I asked myself
p95
aVthat life-defining question:
p96
aVIf my life were a book
p97
aVand I were the author,
p98
aVhow would I want the story to go?
p99
aVAnd I began to daydream.
p100
aVI daydreamed like I did as a little girl
p101
aVand I imagined myself
p102
aVwalking gracefully,
p103
aVhelping other people through my journey
p104
aVand snowboarding again.
p105
aVAnd I didn't just see myself
p106
aVcarving down a mountain of powder,
p107
aVI could actually feel it.
p108
aVI could feel the wind against my face
p109
aVand the beat of my racing heart
p110
aVas if it were happening in that very moment.
p111
aVAnd that is when a new chapter in my life began.
p112
aa(lp113
VFour months later I was back up on a snowboard,
p114
aValthough things didn't go quite as expected:
p115
aVMy knees and my ankles wouldn't bend
p116
aVand at one point I traumatized all the skiers on the chair lift
p117
aVwhen I fell and my legs,
p118
aVstill attached to my snowboard \u2014
p119
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p120
aVwent flying down the mountain,
p121
aVand I was on top of the mountain still.
p122
aVI was so shocked,
p123
aVI was just as shocked as everybody else, and I was so discouraged,
p124
aVbut I knew that if I could find the right pair of feet
p125
aVthat I would be able to do this again.
p126
aVAnd this is when I learned that our borders
p127
aVand our obstacles can only do two things:
p128
aVone, stop us in our tracks
p129
aVor two, force us to get creative.
p130
aa(lp131
VI did a year of research, still couldn't figure out
p132
aVwhat kind of legs to use,
p133
aVcouldn't find any resources that could help me.
p134
aVSo I decided to make a pair myself.
p135
aVMy leg maker and I put random parts together
p136
aVand we made a pair of feet that I could snowboard in.
p137
aVAs you can see,
p138
aVrusted bolts, rubber, wood and neon pink duct tape.
p139
aVAnd yes, I can change my toenail polish.
p140
aVIt was these legs
p141
aVand the best 21st birthday gift I could ever receive \u2014
p142
aVa new kidney from my dad \u2014
p143
aVthat allowed me to follow my dreams again.
p144
aVI started snowboarding,
p145
aVthen I went back to work, then I went back to school.
p146
aa(lp147
VThen in 2005 I cofounded a nonprofit organization
p148
aVfor youth and young adults with physical disabilities
p149
aVso they could get involved with action sports.
p150
aVFrom there, I had the opportunity to go to South Africa,
p151
aVwhere I helped to put shoes on thousands of children's feet
p152
aVso they could attend school.
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd just this past February,
p155
aVI won two back-to-back World Cup gold medals \u2014
p156
aV(Applause) \u2014
p157
aVwhich made me
p158
aVthe highest ranked adaptive female snowboarder
p159
aVin the world.
p160
aa(lp161
VEleven years ago, when I lost my legs,
p162
aVI had no idea what to expect.
p163
aVBut if you ask me today,
p164
aVif I would ever want to change my situation,
p165
aVI would have to say no.
p166
aVBecause my legs haven't disabled me,
p167
aVif anything they've enabled me.
p168
aVThey've forced me to rely on my imagination
p169
aVand to believe in the possibilities,
p170
aVand that's why I believe
p171
aVthat our imaginations can be used as tools
p172
aVfor breaking through borders,
p173
aVbecause in our minds, we can do anything
p174
aVand we can be anything.
p175
aa(lp176
VIt's believing in those dreams
p177
aVand facing our fears head-on
p178
aVthat allows us to live our lives
p179
aVbeyond our limits.
p180
aVAnd although today is about innovation without borders,
p181
aVI have to say that in my life,
p182
aVinnovation has only been possible
p183
aVbecause of my borders.
p184
aVI've learned that borders are where the actual ends,
p185
aVbut also where the imagination
p186
aVand the story begins.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo the thought that I would like  to challenge you with today
p189
aVis that maybe instead of looking at  our challenges and our limitations
p190
aVas something negative or bad,
p191
aVwe can begin to look at them as blessings,
p192
aVmagnificent gifts that can be used to ignite our imaginations
p193
aVand help us go further than we ever knew we could go.
p194
aVIt's not about breaking down borders.
p195
aVIt's about pushing off of them
p196
aVand seeing what amazing places
p197
aVthey might bring us.
p198
aVThank you.

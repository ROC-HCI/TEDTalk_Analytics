VThe idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm
p5
aVis actually quite simple.
p6
aVWe don't want Iran to get the bomb.
p7
aVTheir major asset for developing nuclear weapons
p8
aVis the Natanz uranium enrichment facility.
p9
aVThe gray boxes that you see,
p10
aVthese are real-time control systems.
p11
aVNow if we manage to compromise these systems
p12
aVthat control drive speeds and valves,
p13
aVwe can actually cause a lot of problems
p14
aVwith the centrifuge.
p15
aVThe gray boxes don't run Windows software;
p16
aVthey are a completely different technology.
p17
aVBut if we manage
p18
aVto place a good Windows virus
p19
aVon a notebook
p20
aVthat is used by a maintenance engineer
p21
aVto configure this gray box,
p22
aVthen we are in business.
p23
aVAnd this is the plot behind Stuxnet.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo we start with a Windows dropper.
p26
aVThe payload goes onto the gray box,
p27
aVdamages the centrifuge,
p28
aVand the Iranian nuclear program is delayed \u2014
p29
aVmission accomplished.
p30
aVThat's easy, huh?
p31
aVI want to tell you how we found that out.
p32
aVWhen we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago,
p33
aVit was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was.
p34
aVThe only thing that was known
p35
aVis it's very, very complex on the Windows part, the dropper part,
p36
aVused multiple zero-day vulnerabilities.
p37
aVAnd it seemed to want to do something
p38
aVwith these gray boxes, these real-time control systems.
p39
aVSo that got our attention,
p40
aVand we started a lab project
p41
aVwhere we infected our environment with Stuxnet
p42
aVand checked this thing out.
p43
aVAnd then some very funny things happened.
p44
aVStuxnet behaved like a lab rat
p45
aVthat didn't like our cheese \u2014
p46
aVsniffed, but didn't want to eat.
p47
aVDidn't make sense to me.
p48
aVAnd after we experimented with different flavors of cheese,
p49
aVI realized, well, this is a directed attack.
p50
aVIt's completely directed.
p51
aVThe dropper is prowling actively
p52
aVon the gray box
p53
aVif a specific configuration is found,
p54
aVand even if the actual program code that it's trying to infect
p55
aVis actually running on that target.
p56
aVAnd if not, Stuxnet does nothing.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo that really got my attention,
p59
aVand we started to work on this
p60
aVnearly around the clock,
p61
aVbecause I thought, "Well, we don't know what the target is.
p62
aVIt could be, let's say for example,
p63
aVa U.S. power plant,
p64
aVor a chemical plant in Germany.
p65
aVSo we better find out what the target is soon."
p66
aVSo we extracted and decompiled
p67
aVthe attack code,
p68
aVand we discovered that it's structured in two digital bombs \u2014
p69
aVa smaller one and a bigger one.
p70
aVAnd we also saw that they are very professionally engineered
p71
aVby people who obviously had all insider information.
p72
aVThey knew all the bits and bites
p73
aVthat they had to attack.
p74
aVThey probably even know the shoe size of the operator.
p75
aVSo they know everything.
p76
aa(lp77
VAnd if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet
p78
aVis complex and high-tech,
p79
aVlet me tell you this:
p80
aVthe payload is rocket science.
p81
aVIt's way above everything
p82
aVthat we have ever seen before.
p83
aVHere you see a sample of this actual attack code.
p84
aVWe are talking about \u2014
p85
aVaround about 15,000 lines of code.
p86
aVLooks pretty much like old-style assembly language.
p87
aVAnd I want to tell you how we were able
p88
aVto make sense out of this code.
p89
aVSo what we were looking for is, first of all, system function calls,
p90
aVbecause we know what they do.
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd then we were looking for timers and data structures
p93
aVand trying to relate them to the real world \u2014
p94
aVto potential real world targets.
p95
aVSo we do need target theories
p96
aVthat we can prove or disprove.
p97
aVIn order to get target theories,
p98
aVwe remember
p99
aVthat it's definitely hardcore sabotage,
p100
aVit must be a high-value target
p101
aVand it is most likely located in Iran,
p102
aVbecause that's where most of the infections had been reported.
p103
aVNow you don't find several thousand targets in that area.
p104
aVIt basically boils down
p105
aVto the Bushehr nuclear power plant
p106
aVand to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo I told my assistant,
p109
aV"Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base."
p110
aVAnd I phoned them up and picked their brain
p111
aVin an effort to match their expertise
p112
aVwith what we found in code and data.
p113
aVAnd that worked pretty well.
p114
aVSo we were able to associate
p115
aVthe small digital warhead
p116
aVwith the rotor control.
p117
aVThe rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge,
p118
aVthat black object that you see.
p119
aVAnd if you manipulate the speed of this rotor,
p120
aVyou are actually able to crack the rotor
p121
aVand eventually even have the centrifuge explode.
p122
aVWhat we also saw
p123
aVis that the goal of the attack
p124
aVwas really to do it slowly and creepy \u2014
p125
aVobviously in an effort
p126
aVto drive maintenance engineers crazy,
p127
aVthat they would not be able to figure this out quickly.
p128
aa(lp129
VThe big digital warhead \u2014 we had a shot at this
p130
aVby looking very closely
p131
aVat data and data structures.
p132
aVSo for example, the number 164
p133
aVreally stands out in that code;
p134
aVyou can't overlook it.
p135
aVI started to research scientific literature
p136
aVon how these centrifuges
p137
aVare actually built in Natanz
p138
aVand found they are structured
p139
aVin what is called a cascade,
p140
aVand each cascade holds 164 centrifuges.
p141
aVSo that made sense, that was a match.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd it even got better.
p144
aVThese centrifuges in Iran
p145
aVare subdivided into 15, what is called, stages.
p146
aVAnd guess what we found in the attack code?
p147
aVAn almost identical structure.
p148
aVSo again, that was a real good match.
p149
aVAnd this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at.
p150
aVNow don't get me wrong here, it didn't go like this.
p151
aVThese results have been obtained
p152
aVover several weeks of really hard labor.
p153
aVAnd we often went into just a dead end
p154
aVand had to recover.
p155
aa(lp156
VAnyway, so we figured out
p157
aVthat both digital warheads
p158
aVwere actually aiming at one and the same target,
p159
aVbut from different angles.
p160
aVThe small warhead is taking one cascade,
p161
aVand spinning up the rotors and slowing them down,
p162
aVand the big warhead
p163
aVis talking to six cascades
p164
aVand manipulating valves.
p165
aVSo in all, we are very confident
p166
aVthat we have actually determined what the target is.
p167
aVIt is Natanz, and it is only Natanz.
p168
aVSo we don't have to worry
p169
aVthat other targets
p170
aVmight be hit by Stuxnet.
p171
aa(lp172
VHere's some very cool stuff that we saw \u2014
p173
aVreally knocked my socks off.
p174
aVDown there is the gray box,
p175
aVand on the top you see the centrifuges.
p176
aVNow what this thing does
p177
aVis it intercepts the input values from sensors \u2014
p178
aVso for example, from pressure sensors
p179
aVand vibration sensors \u2014
p180
aVand it provides legitimate program code,
p181
aVwhich is still running during the attack,
p182
aVwith fake input data.
p183
aVAnd as a matter of fact, this fake input data
p184
aVis actually prerecorded by Stuxnet.
p185
aVSo it's just like from the Hollywood movies
p186
aVwhere during the heist,
p187
aVthe observation camera is fed with prerecorded video.
p188
aVThat's cool, huh?
p189
aa(lp190
VThe idea here is obviously
p191
aVnot only to fool the operators in the control room.
p192
aVIt actually is much more dangerous and aggressive.
p193
aVThe idea
p194
aVis to circumvent a digital safety system.
p195
aVWe need digital safety systems
p196
aVwhere a human operator could not act quick enough.
p197
aVSo for example, in a power plant,
p198
aVwhen your big steam turbine gets too over speed,
p199
aVyou must open relief valves within a millisecond.
p200
aVObviously, this cannot be done by a human operator.
p201
aVSo this is where we need digital safety systems.
p202
aVAnd when they are compromised,
p203
aVthen real bad things can happen.
p204
aVYour plant can blow up.
p205
aVAnd neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it.
p206
aVThat's scary.
p207
aa(lp208
VBut it gets worse.
p209
aVAnd this is very important, what I'm going to say.
p210
aVThink about this:
p211
aVthis attack is generic.
p212
aVIt doesn't have anything to do, in specifics,
p213
aVwith centrifuges,
p214
aVwith uranium enrichment.
p215
aVSo it would work as well, for example,
p216
aVin a power plant
p217
aVor in an automobile factory.
p218
aVIt is generic.
p219
aVAnd you don't have \u2014 as an attacker \u2014
p220
aVyou don't have to deliver this payload
p221
aVby a USB stick,
p222
aVas we saw it in the case of Stuxnet.
p223
aVYou could also use conventional worm technology for spreading.
p224
aVJust spread it as wide as possible.
p225
aVAnd if you do that,
p226
aVwhat you end up with
p227
aVis a cyber weapon of mass destruction.
p228
aVThat's the consequence
p229
aVthat we have to face.
p230
aVSo unfortunately,
p231
aVthe biggest number of targets for such attacks
p232
aVare not in the Middle East.
p233
aVThey're in the United States and Europe and in Japan.
p234
aVSo all of the green areas,
p235
aVthese are your target-rich environments.
p236
aVWe have to face the consequences,
p237
aVand we better start to prepare right now.
p238
aa(lp239
VThanks.
p240
aa(lp241
V(Applause)
p242
aa(lp243
VChris Anderson: I've got a question.
p244
aVRalph, it's been quite widely reported
p245
aVthat people assume that Mossad
p246
aVis the main entity behind this.
p247
aVIs that your opinion?
p248
aa(lp249
VRalph Langner: Okay, you really want to hear that?
p250
aVYeah. Okay.
p251
aVMy opinion is that the Mossad is involved,
p252
aVbut that the leading force is not Israel.
p253
aVSo the leading force behind that
p254
aVis the cyber superpower.
p255
aVThere is only one,
p256
aVand that's the United States \u2014
p257
aVfortunately, fortunately.
p258
aVBecause otherwise,
p259
aVour problems would even be bigger.
p260
aa(lp261
VCA: Thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us. Thank you, Ralph.

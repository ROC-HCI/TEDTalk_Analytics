VGood afternoon.
p7
aa(lp8
VAs you're all aware, we face difficult economic times.
p9
aVI come to you with a modest proposal
p10
aVfor easing the financial burden.
p11
aa(lp12
VThis idea came to me while talking to
p13
aVa physicist friend of mine at MIT.
p14
aVHe was struggling to explain something to me:
p15
aVa beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter.
p16
aVNow he confused me from the very start,
p17
aVbecause light doesn't cool things down.
p18
aVIt makes it hotter. It's happening right now.
p19
aVThe reason that you can see me standing here is because
p20
aVthis room is filled with more than 100 quintillion photons,
p21
aVand they're moving randomly through the space, near the speed of light.
p22
aVAll of them are different colors,
p23
aVthey're rippling with different frequencies,
p24
aVand they're bouncing off every surface, including me,
p25
aVand some of those are flying directly into your eyes,
p26
aVand that's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here.
p27
aa(lp28
VNow a laser is different.
p29
aVIt also uses photons, but they're all synchronized,
p30
aVand if you focus them into a beam,
p31
aVwhat you have is an incredibly useful tool.
p32
aVThe control of a laser is so precise
p33
aVthat you can perform surgery inside of an eye,
p34
aVyou can use it to store massive amounts of data,
p35
aVand you can use it for this beautiful experiment
p36
aVthat my friend was struggling to explain.
p37
aVFirst you trap atoms in a special bottle.
p38
aVIt uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atoms
p39
aVfrom the noise of the environment.
p40
aVAnd the atoms themselves are quite violent,
p41
aVbut if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency,
p42
aVan atom will briefly absorb those photons
p43
aVand tend to slow down.
p44
aVLittle by little it gets colder
p45
aVuntil eventually it approaches absolute zero.
p46
aa(lp47
VNow if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough,
p48
aVsomething truly bizarre happens.
p49
aVIt's no longer a solid, a liquid or a gas.
p50
aVIt enters a new state of matter called a superfluid.
p51
aVThe atoms lose their individual identity,
p52
aVand the rules from the quantum world take over,
p53
aVand that's what gives superfluids such spooky properties.
p54
aVFor example, if you shine light through a superfluid,
p55
aVit is able to slow photons down
p56
aVto 60 kilometers per hour.
p57
aVAnother spooky property is that it flows
p58
aVwith absolutely no viscosity or friction,
p59
aVso if you were to take the lid off that bottle,
p60
aVit won't stay inside.
p61
aVA thin film will creep up the inside wall,
p62
aVflow over the top and right out the outside.
p63
aVNow of course, the moment that it does hit the outside environment,
p64
aVand its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree,
p65
aVit immediately turns back into normal matter.
p66
aVSuperfluids are one of the most fragile things we've ever discovered.
p67
aVAnd this is the great pleasure of science:
p68
aVthe defeat of our intuition through experimentation.
p69
aa(lp70
VBut the experiment is not the end of the story,
p71
aVbecause you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people.
p72
aVI have a Ph.D in molecular biology.
p73
aVI still barely understand what most scientists are talking about.
p74
aVSo as my friend was trying to explain that experiment,
p75
aVit seemed like the more he said,
p76
aVthe less I understood.
p77
aVBecause if you're trying to give someone the big picture
p78
aVof a complex idea, to really capture its essence,
p79
aVthe fewer words you use, the better.
p80
aVIn fact, the ideal may be to use no words at all.
p81
aVI remember thinking, my friend could have explained
p82
aVthat entire experiment with a dance.
p83
aVOf course, there never seem to be any dancers around when you need them.
p84
aa(lp85
VNow, the idea is not as crazy as it sounds.
p86
aVI started a contest four years ago called Dance Your Ph.D.
p87
aVInstead of explaining their research with words,
p88
aVscientists have to explain it with dance.
p89
aVNow surprisingly, it seems to work.
p90
aVDance really can make science easier to understand.
p91
aVBut don't take my word for it.
p92
aVGo on the Internet and search for "Dance Your Ph.D."
p93
aVThere are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you.
p94
aa(lp95
VThe most surprising thing that I've learned while running this contest
p96
aVis that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research.
p97
aVFor example, at the University of Minnesota,
p98
aVthere's a biomedical engineer named David Odde,
p99
aVand he works with dancers to study how cells move.
p100
aVThey do it by changing their shape.
p101
aVWhen a chemical signal washes up on one side,
p102
aVit triggers the cell to expand its shape on that side,
p103
aVbecause the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment.
p104
aVSo that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions.
p105
aVBut what seems so slow and graceful from the outside
p106
aVis really more like chaos inside,
p107
aVbecause cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fibers,
p108
aVand those fibers are constantly falling apart.
p109
aVBut just as quickly as they explode,
p110
aVmore proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer,
p111
aVso it's constantly changing
p112
aVjust to remain exactly the same.
p113
aVNow, David builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab,
p114
aVbut before he does that, he works with dancers
p115
aVto figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place.
p116
aVIt's basically efficient brainstorming,
p117
aVand when I visited David to learn about his research,
p118
aVhe used dancers to explain it to me
p119
aVrather than the usual method: PowerPoint.
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd this brings me to my modest proposal.
p122
aVI think that bad PowerPoint presentations
p123
aVare a serious threat to the global economy.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p126
aa(lp127
VNow it does depend on how you measure it, of course,
p128
aVbut one estimate has put the drain at 250 million dollars per day.
p129
aVNow that assumes half-hour presentations
p130
aVfor an average audience of four people
p131
aVwith salaries of 35,000 dollars,
p132
aVand it conservatively assumes that
p133
aVabout a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time,
p134
aVand given that there are some apparently
p135
aV30 million PowerPoint presentations created every day,
p136
aVthat would indeed add up to an annual waste
p137
aVof 100 billion dollars.
p138
aVOf course, that's just the time we're losing
p139
aVsitting through presentations.
p140
aVThere are other costs, because PowerPoint is a tool,
p141
aVand like any tool, it can and will be abused.
p142
aVTo borrow a concept from my country's CIA,
p143
aVit helps you to soften up your audience.
p144
aVIt distracts them with pretty pictures, irrelevant data.
p145
aVIt allows you to create the illusion of competence,
p146
aVthe illusion of simplicity,
p147
aVand most destructively, the illusion of understanding.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo now my country is 15 trillion dollars in debt.
p150
aVOur leaders are working tirelessly to try and find ways to save money.
p151
aVOne idea is to drastically reduce public support for the arts.
p152
aVFor example, our National Endowment for the Arts,
p153
aVwith its $150 million budget,
p154
aVslashing that program would immediately reduce the national debt
p155
aVby about one one-thousandth of a percent.
p156
aVOne certainly can't argue with those numbers.
p157
aVHowever, once we eliminate public funding for the arts,
p158
aVthere will be some drawbacks.
p159
aVThe artists on the street will swell the ranks of the unemployed.
p160
aVMany will turn to drug abuse and prostitution,
p161
aVand that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods.
p162
aVAll of this could wipe out the savings we're hoping to make in the first place.
p163
aa(lp164
VI shall now, therefore, humbly propose my own thoughts,
p165
aVwhich I hope will not be liable to the least objection.
p166
aVOnce we eliminate public funding for the artists,
p167
aVlet's put them back to work
p168
aVby using them instead of PowerPoint.
p169
aVAs a test case, I propose we start with American dancers.
p170
aVAfter all, they are the most perishable of their kind,
p171
aVprone to injury and very slow to heal
p172
aVdue to our health care system.
p173
aVRather than dancing our Ph.Ds,
p174
aVwe should use dance to explain all of our complex problems.
p175
aVImagine our politicians using dance
p176
aVto explain why we must invade a foreign country
p177
aVor bail out an investment bank.
p178
aVIt's sure to help.
p179
aa(lp180
VOf course someday, in the deep future,
p181
aVa technology of persuasion
p182
aVeven more powerful than PowerPoint may be invented,
p183
aVrendering dancers unnecessary as tools of rhetoric.
p184
aVHowever, I trust that by that day,
p185
aVwe shall have passed this present financial calamity.
p186
aVPerhaps by then we will be able to afford the luxury
p187
aVof just sitting in an audience
p188
aVwith no other purpose
p189
aVthan to witness the human form in motion.

VSo the Awesome story:
p5
aVIt begins about 40 years ago,
p6
aVwhen my mom and my dad came to Canada.
p7
aVMy mom left Nairobi, Kenya.
p8
aVMy dad left a small village outside of Amritsar, India.
p9
aVAnd they got here in the late 1960s.
p10
aVThey settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto,
p11
aVand they settled into a new life.
p12
aVThey saw their first dentist,
p13
aVthey ate their first hamburger,
p14
aVand they had their first kids.
p15
aVMy sister and I
p16
aVgrew up here,
p17
aVand we had quiet, happy childhoods.
p18
aVWe had close family,
p19
aVgood friends, a quiet street.
p20
aVWe grew up taking for granted
p21
aVa lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted
p22
aVwhen they grew up \u2014
p23
aVthings like power always on
p24
aVin our houses,
p25
aVthings like schools across the street
p26
aVand hospitals down the road
p27
aVand popsicles in the backyard.
p28
aVWe grew up, and we grew older.
p29
aVI went to high school.
p30
aVI graduated.
p31
aVI moved out of the house, I got a job,
p32
aVI found a girl, I settled down \u2014
p33
aVand I realize it sounds like a bad sitcom or a Cat Stevens' song \u2014
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
Vbut life was pretty good.
p38
aVLife was pretty good.
p39
aV2006 was a great year.
p40
aVUnder clear blue skies in July in the wine region of Ontario,
p41
aVI got married,
p42
aVsurrounded by 150 family and friends.
p43
aV2007 was a great year.
p44
aVI graduated from school,
p45
aVand I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends.
p46
aVHere's a picture of me and my friend, Chris,
p47
aVon the coast of the Pacific Ocean.
p48
aVWe actually saw seals out of our car window,
p49
aVand we pulled over to take a quick picture of them
p50
aVand then blocked them with our giant heads.
p51
aV(Laughter)
p52
aVSo you can't actually see them,
p53
aVbut it was breathtaking,
p54
aVbelieve me.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
V2008 and 2009 were a little tougher.
p59
aVI know that they were tougher for a lot of people,
p60
aVnot just me.
p61
aVFirst of all, the news was so heavy.
p62
aVIt's still heavy now, and it was heavy before that,
p63
aVbut when you flipped open a newspaper, when you turned on the TV,
p64
aVit was about ice caps melting,
p65
aVwars going on around the world,
p66
aVearthquakes, hurricanes
p67
aVand an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse,
p68
aVand then eventually did collapse,
p69
aVand so many of us losing our homes,
p70
aVor our jobs,
p71
aVor our retirements,
p72
aVor our livelihoods.
p73
aV2008, 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason, too.
p74
aVI was going through a lot of personal problems at the time.
p75
aVMy marriage wasn't going well,
p76
aVand we just were growing further and further apart.
p77
aVOne day my wife came home from work
p78
aVand summoned the courage, through a lot of tears,
p79
aVto have a very honest conversation.
p80
aVAnd she said, "I don't love you anymore,"
p81
aVand it was one of the most painful things I'd ever heard
p82
aVand certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard,
p83
aVuntil only a month later,
p84
aVwhen I heard something even more heartbreaking.
p85
aa(lp86
VMy friend Chris, who I just showed you a picture of,
p87
aVhad been battling mental illness for some time.
p88
aVAnd for those of you
p89
aVwhose lives have been touched by mental illness,
p90
aVyou know how challenging it can be.
p91
aVI spoke to him on the phone at 10:30 p.m.
p92
aVon a Sunday night.
p93
aVWe talked about the TV show we watched that evening.
p94
aVAnd Monday morning, I found out that he disappeared.
p95
aVVery sadly, he took his own life.
p96
aVAnd it was a really heavy time.
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd as these dark clouds were circling me,
p99
aVand I was finding it really, really difficult
p100
aVto think of anything good,
p101
aVI said to myself that I really needed a way
p102
aVto focus on the positive somehow.
p103
aVSo I came home from work one night,
p104
aVand I logged onto the computer,
p105
aVand I started up a tiny website
p106
aVcalled 1000awesomethings.com.
p107
aVI was trying to remind myself
p108
aVof the simple, universal, little pleasures that we all love,
p109
aVbut we just don't talk about enough \u2014
p110
aVthings like waiters and waitresses
p111
aVwho bring you free refills without asking,
p112
aVbeing the first table to get called up
p113
aVto the dinner buffet at a wedding,
p114
aVwearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer,
p115
aVor when cashiers open up a new check-out lane at the grocery store
p116
aVand you get to be first in line \u2014
p117
aVeven if you were last at the other line, swoop right in there.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd slowly over time,
p122
aVI started putting myself in a better mood.
p123
aVI mean, 50,000 blogs
p124
aVare started a day,
p125
aVand so my blog was just one of those 50,000.
p126
aVAnd nobody read it except for my mom.
p127
aVAlthough I should say that my traffic did skyrocket
p128
aVand go up by 100 percent
p129
aVwhen she forwarded it to my dad.
p130
aV(Laughter)
p131
aVAnd then I got excited
p132
aVwhen it started getting tens of hits,
p133
aVand then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens
p134
aVand then hundreds and then thousands
p135
aVand then millions.
p136
aVIt started getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
p137
aVAnd then I got a phone call,
p138
aVand the voice at the other end of the line said,
p139
aV"You've just won the Best Blog In the World award."
p140
aVI was like, that sounds totally fake.
p141
aV(Laughter)
p142
aV(Applause)
p143
aVWhich African country do you want me to wire all my money to?
p144
aV(Laughter)
p145
aVBut it turns out, I jumped on a plane,
p146
aVand I ended up walking a red carpet
p147
aVbetween Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart.
p148
aVAnd I went onstage to accept a Webby award for Best Blog.
p149
aVAnd the surprise
p150
aVand just the amazement of that
p151
aVwas only overshadowed by my return to Toronto,
p152
aVwhen, in my inbox,
p153
aV10 literary agents were waiting for me
p154
aVto talk about putting this into a book.
p155
aVFlash-forward to the next year
p156
aVand "The Book of Awesome" has now been
p157
aVnumber one on the bestseller list for 20 straight weeks.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Applause)
p160
aa(lp161
VBut look, I said I wanted to do three things with you today.
p162
aVI said I wanted to tell you the Awesome story,
p163
aVI wanted to share with you the three As of Awesome,
p164
aVand I wanted to leave you with a closing thought.
p165
aVSo let's talk about those three As.
p166
aVOver the last few years,
p167
aVI haven't had that much time to really think.
p168
aVBut lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back
p169
aVand ask myself: "What is it over the last few years
p170
aVthat helped me grow my website,
p171
aVbut also grow myself?"
p172
aVAnd I've summarized those things, for me personally,
p173
aVas three As.
p174
aVThey are Attitude, Awareness
p175
aVand Authenticity.
p176
aVI'd love to just talk about each one briefly.
p177
aa(lp178
VSo Attitude:
p179
aVLook, we're all going to get lumps,
p180
aVand we're all going to get bumps.
p181
aVNone of us can predict the future, but we do know one thing about it
p182
aVand that's that it ain't gonna go according to plan.
p183
aVWe will all have high highs
p184
aVand big days and proud moments
p185
aVof smiles on graduation stages,
p186
aVfather-daughter dances at weddings
p187
aVand healthy babies screeching in the delivery room,
p188
aVbut between those high highs,
p189
aVwe may also have some lumps and some bumps too.
p190
aVIt's sad, and it's not pleasant to talk about,
p191
aVbut your husband might leave you,
p192
aVyour girlfriend could cheat,
p193
aVyour headaches might be more serious than you thought,
p194
aVor your dog could get hit by a car on the street.
p195
aVIt's not a happy thought,
p196
aVbut your kids could get mixed up in gangs
p197
aVor bad scenes.
p198
aVYour mom could get cancer,
p199
aVyour dad could get mean.
p200
aVAnd there are times in life
p201
aVwhen you will be tossed in the well, too,
p202
aVwith twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart,
p203
aVand when that bad news washes over you,
p204
aVand when that pain sponges and soaks in,
p205
aVI just really hope you feel
p206
aVlike you've always got two choices.
p207
aVOne, you can swirl and twirl
p208
aVand gloom and doom forever,
p209
aVor two, you can grieve
p210
aVand then face the future
p211
aVwith newly sober eyes.
p212
aVHaving a great attitude is about choosing option number two,
p213
aVand choosing, no matter how difficult it is,
p214
aVno matter what pain hits you,
p215
aVchoosing to move forward and move on
p216
aVand take baby steps into the future.
p217
aa(lp218
VThe second "A" is Awareness.
p219
aVI love hanging out with three year-olds.
p220
aVI love the way that they see the world,
p221
aVbecause they're seeing the world for the first time.
p222
aVI love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk.
p223
aVI love the way that they'll stare slack-jawed
p224
aVat their first baseball game
p225
aVwith wide eyes and a mitt on their hand,
p226
aVsoaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts
p227
aVand the smell of the hotdogs.
p228
aVI love the way that they'll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard
p229
aVand putting them into a nice centerpiece
p230
aVfor Thanksgiving dinner.
p231
aVI love the way that they see the world,
p232
aVbecause they're seeing the world
p233
aVfor the first time.
p234
aVHaving a sense of awareness
p235
aVis just about embracing your inner three year-old.
p236
aVBecause you all used to be three years old.
p237
aVThat three-year-old boy is still part of you.
p238
aVThat three-year-old girl is still part of you.
p239
aVThey're in there.
p240
aVAnd being aware is just about remembering
p241
aVthat you saw everything you've seen
p242
aVfor the first time once, too.
p243
aVSo there was a time when it was your first time ever
p244
aVhitting a string of green lights on the way home from work.
p245
aVThere was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery
p246
aVand smelt the bakery air,
p247
aVor the first time you pulled a 20-dollar bill out of your old jacket pocket
p248
aVand said, "Found money."
p249
aa(lp250
VThe last "A" is Authenticity.
p251
aVAnd for this one, I want to tell you a quick story.
p252
aVLet's go all the way back to 1932
p253
aVwhen, on a peanut farm in Georgia,
p254
aVa little baby boy named Roosevelt Grier was born.
p255
aVRoosevelt Grier, or Rosey Grier, as people used to call him,
p256
aVgrew up and grew into
p257
aVa 300-pound, six-foot-five linebacker in the NFL.
p258
aVHe's number 76 in the picture.
p259
aVHere he is pictured with the "fearsome foursome."
p260
aVThese were four guys on the L.A. Rams in the 1960s
p261
aVyou did not want to go up against.
p262
aVThey were tough football players doing what they love,
p263
aVwhich was crushing skulls
p264
aVand separating shoulders on the football field.
p265
aVBut Rosey Grier also had
p266
aVanother passion.
p267
aVIn his deeply authentic self,
p268
aVhe also loved needlepoint. (Laughter)
p269
aVHe loved knitting.
p270
aVHe said that it calmed him down, it relaxed him,
p271
aVit took away his fear of flying and helped him meet chicks.
p272
aVThat's what he said.
p273
aVI mean, he loved it so much that, after he retired from the NFL,
p274
aVhe started joining clubs.
p275
aVAnd he even put out a book
p276
aVcalled "Rosey Grier's Needlepoint for Men."
p277
aV(Laughter)
p278
aV(Applause)
p279
aVIt's a great cover.
p280
aVIf you notice, he's actually needlepointing his own face.
p281
aa(lp282
V(Laughter)
p283
aa(lp284
VAnd so what I love about this story
p285
aVis that Rosey Grier
p286
aVis just such an authentic person,
p287
aVand that's what authenticity is all about.
p288
aVIt's just about being you and being cool with that.
p289
aVAnd I think when you're authentic,
p290
aVyou end up following your heart,
p291
aVand you put yourself in places
p292
aVand situations and in conversations
p293
aVthat you love and that you enjoy.
p294
aVYou meet people that you like talking to.
p295
aVYou go places you've dreamt about.
p296
aVAnd you end you end up following your heart
p297
aVand feeling very fulfilled.
p298
aVSo those are the three A's.
p299
aa(lp300
VFor the closing thought, I want to take you all the way back
p301
aVto my parents coming to Canada.
p302
aVI don't know what it would feel like
p303
aVcoming to a new country when you're in your mid-20s.
p304
aVI don't know, because I never did it,
p305
aVbut I would imagine that it would take a great attitude.
p306
aVI would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your surroundings
p307
aVand appreciating the small wonders
p308
aVthat you're starting to see in your new world.
p309
aVAnd I think you'd have to be really authentic,
p310
aVyou'd have to be really true to yourself
p311
aVin order to get through what you're being exposed to.
p312
aa(lp313
VI'd like to pause my TEDTalk
p314
aVfor about 10 seconds right now,
p315
aVbecause you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this,
p316
aVand my parents are sitting in the front row.
p317
aVSo I wanted to ask them to, if they don't mind, stand up.
p318
aVAnd I just wanted to say thank you to you guys.
p319
aa(lp320
V(Applause)
p321
aa(lp322
VWhen I was growing up, my dad used to love telling the story
p323
aVof his first day in Canada.
p324
aVAnd it's a great story, because what happened was
p325
aVhe got off the plane at the Toronto airport,
p326
aVand he was welcomed by a non-profit group,
p327
aVwhich I'm sure someone in this room runs.
p328
aV(Laughter)
p329
aVAnd this non-profit group had a big welcoming lunch
p330
aVfor all the new immigrants to Canada.
p331
aVAnd my dad says he got off the plane and he went to this lunch
p332
aVand there was this huge spread.
p333
aVThere was bread, there was those little, mini dill pickles,
p334
aVthere was olives, those little white onions.
p335
aVThere was rolled up turkey cold cuts,
p336
aVrolled up ham cold cuts, rolled up roast beef cold cuts
p337
aVand little cubes of cheese.
p338
aVThere was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches
p339
aVand salmon salad sandwiches.
p340
aVThere was lasagna, there was casseroles,
p341
aVthere was brownies, there was butter tarts,
p342
aVand there was pies, lots and lots of pies.
p343
aVAnd when my dad tells the story, he says,
p344
aV"The craziest thing was, I'd never seen any of that before, except bread.
p345
aV(Laughter)
p346
aVI didn't know what was meat, what was vegetarian.
p347
aVI was eating olives with pie.
p348
aV(Laughter)
p349
aVI just couldn't believe how many things you can get here."
p350
aa(lp351
V(Laughter)
p352
aa(lp353
VWhen I was five years old,
p354
aVmy dad used to take me grocery shopping,
p355
aVand he would stare in wonder
p356
aVat the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables.
p357
aVHe would say, "Look, can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico?
p358
aVThey've got an apple here from South Africa.
p359
aVCan you believe they've got a date from Morocco?"
p360
aVHe's like, "Do you know where Morocco even is?"
p361
aVAnd I'd say, "I'm five. I don't even know where I am.
p362
aVIs this A&P?"
p363
aVAnd he'd say, "I don't know where Morocco is either, but let's find out."
p364
aVAnd so we'd buy the date, and we'd go home.
p365
aVAnd we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf,
p366
aVand we'd flip through until we found this mysterious country.
p367
aVAnd when we did, my dad would say,
p368
aV"Can you believe someone climbed a tree over there,
p369
aVpicked this thing off it, put it in a truck,
p370
aVdrove it all the way to the docks
p371
aVand then sailed it all the way
p372
aVacross the Atlantic Ocean
p373
aVand then put it in another truck
p374
aVand drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house,
p375
aVso they could sell it to us for 25 cents?"
p376
aVAnd I'd say, "I don't believe that."
p377
aVAnd he's like, "I don't believe it either.
p378
aVThings are amazing. There's just so many things to be happy about."
p379
aa(lp380
VWhen I stop to think about it, he's absolutely right.
p381
aVThere are so many things to be happy about.
p382
aVWe are the only species
p383
aVon the only life-giving rock
p384
aVin the entire universe that we've ever seen,
p385
aVcapable of experiencing
p386
aVso many of these things.
p387
aVI mean, we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture.
p388
aVWe're the only ones with jewelry and democracy.
p389
aVWe've got airplanes, highway lanes,
p390
aVinterior design and horoscope signs.
p391
aVWe've got fashion magazines, house party scenes.
p392
aVYou can watch a horror movie with monsters.
p393
aVYou can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming.
p394
aVWe've got books, buffets and radio waves,
p395
aVwedding brides and rollercoaster rides.
p396
aVYou can sleep in clean sheets.
p397
aVYou can go to the movies and get good seats.
p398
aVYou can smell bakery air, walk around with rain hair,
p399
aVpop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap.
p400
aa(lp401
VWe've got all that,
p402
aVbut we've only got 100 years to enjoy it.
p403
aVAnd that's the sad part.
p404
aVThe cashiers at your grocery store,
p405
aVthe foreman at your plant,
p406
aVthe guy tailgating you home on the highway,
p407
aVthe telemarketer calling you during dinner,
p408
aVevery teacher you've ever had,
p409
aVeveryone that's ever woken up beside you,
p410
aVevery politician in every country,
p411
aVevery actor in every movie,
p412
aVevery single person in your family, everyone you love,
p413
aVeveryone in this room and you
p414
aVwill be dead in a hundred years.
p415
aVLife is so great that we only get such a short time
p416
aVto experience and enjoy
p417
aVall those tiny little moments that make it so sweet.
p418
aVAnd that moment is right now,
p419
aVand those moments are counting down,
p420
aVand those moments are always, always, always fleeting.
p421
aa(lp422
VYou will never be as young as you are right now.
p423
aVAnd that's why I believe that if you live your life
p424
aVwith a great attitude,
p425
aVchoosing to move forward and move on
p426
aVwhenever life deals you a blow,
p427
aVliving with a sense of awareness of the world around you,
p428
aVembracing your inner three year-old
p429
aVand seeing the tiny joys that make life so sweet
p430
aVand being authentic to yourself,
p431
aVbeing you and being cool with that,
p432
aVletting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you,
p433
aVthen I think you'll live a life
p434
aVthat is rich and is satisfying,
p435
aVand I think you'll live a life that is truly awesome.
p436
aa(lp437
VThank you.

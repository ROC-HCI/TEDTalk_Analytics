VSo I begin with an advertisement
p5
aVinspired by George Orwell
p6
aVthat Apple ran in 1984.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Video) Big Brother: We are one people
p9
aVwith one will, one resolve,
p10
aVone cause.
p11
aVOur enemies shall talk themselves to death,
p12
aVand we will fight them with their own confusion.
p13
aVWe shall prevail.
p14
aVNarrator: On January 24th,
p15
aVApple Computer will introduce Macintosh.
p16
aVAnd you'll see why 1984
p17
aVwon't be like "1984."
p18
aa(lp19
VRebecca MacKinnon: So the underlying message of this video
p20
aVremains very powerful even today.
p21
aVTechnology created by innovative companies
p22
aVwill set us all free.
p23
aVFast-forward more than two decades:
p24
aVApple launches the iPhone in China
p25
aVand censors the Dalai Lama out
p26
aValong with several other politically sensitive applications
p27
aVat the request of the Chinese government
p28
aVfor its Chinese app store.
p29
aVThe American political cartoonist
p30
aVMark Fiore
p31
aValso had his satire application
p32
aVcensored in the United States
p33
aVbecause some of Apple's staff
p34
aVwere concerned it would be offensive to some groups.
p35
aVHis app wasn't reinstated
p36
aVuntil he won the Pulitzer Prize.
p37
aVThe German magazine Stern, a news magazine,
p38
aVhad its app censored
p39
aVbecause the Apple nannies deemed it
p40
aVto be a little bit too racy for their users,
p41
aVand despite the fact that this magazine
p42
aVis perfectly legal for sale
p43
aVon newsstands throughout Germany.
p44
aVAnd more controversially, recently,
p45
aVApple censored a Palestinian protest app
p46
aVafter the Israeli government voiced concerns
p47
aVthat it might be used to organize violent attacks.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo here's the thing.
p50
aVWe have a situation where private companies
p51
aVare applying censorship standards
p52
aVthat are often quite arbitrary
p53
aVand generally more narrow
p54
aVthan the free speech constitutional standards
p55
aVthat we have in democracies.
p56
aVOr they're responding to censorship requests
p57
aVby authoritarian regimes
p58
aVthat do not reflect consent of the governed.
p59
aVOr they're responding to requests and concerns
p60
aVby governments that have no jurisdiction
p61
aVover many, or most, of the users and viewers
p62
aVwho are interacting with the content in question.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo here's the situation.
p65
aVIn a pre-Internet world,
p66
aVsovereignty over our physical freedoms,
p67
aVor lack thereof,
p68
aVwas controlled almost entirely
p69
aVby nation-states.
p70
aVBut now we have this new layer
p71
aVof private sovereignty
p72
aVin cyberspace.
p73
aVAnd their decisions about software coding,
p74
aVengineering, design, terms of service
p75
aVall act as a kind of law
p76
aVthat shapes what we can and cannot do with our digital lives.
p77
aVAnd their sovereignties,
p78
aVcross-cutting, globally interlinked,
p79
aVcan in some ways
p80
aVchallenge the sovereignties of nation-states
p81
aVin very exciting ways,
p82
aVbut sometimes also act
p83
aVto project and extend it
p84
aVat a time when control
p85
aVover what people can and cannot do
p86
aVwith information
p87
aVhas more effect than ever
p88
aVon the exercise of power
p89
aVin our physical world.
p90
aVAfter all, even the leader of the free world
p91
aVneeds a little help from the sultan of Facebookistan
p92
aVif he wants to get reelected next year.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd these platforms
p95
aVwere certainly very helpful
p96
aVto activists in Tunisia and Egypt
p97
aVthis past spring and beyond.
p98
aVAs Wael Ghonim,
p99
aVthe Google-Egyptian-executive by day,
p100
aVsecret-Facebook-activist by night,
p101
aVfamously said to CNN
p102
aVafter Mubarak stepped down,
p103
aV"If you want to liberate a society,
p104
aVjust give them the Internet."
p105
aVBut overthrowing a government is one thing
p106
aVand building a stable democracy
p107
aVis a bit more complicated.
p108
aVOn the left there's a photo taken by an Egyptian activist
p109
aVwho was part of the storming
p110
aVof the Egyptian state security offices in March.
p111
aVAnd many of the agents
p112
aVshredded as many of the documents as they could
p113
aVand left them behind in piles.
p114
aVBut some of the files were left behind intact,
p115
aVand activists, some of them,
p116
aVfound their own surveillance dossiers
p117
aVfull of transcripts of their email exchanges,
p118
aVtheir cellphone text message exchanges,
p119
aVeven Skype conversations.
p120
aVAnd one activist actually found
p121
aVa contract from a Western company
p122
aVfor the sale of surveillance technology
p123
aVto the Egyptian security forces.
p124
aVAnd Egyptian activists are assuming
p125
aVthat these technologies for surveillance
p126
aVare still being used
p127
aVby the transitional authorities running the networks there.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd in Tunisia, censorship actually began to return in May \u2014
p130
aVnot nearly as extensively
p131
aVas under President Ben Ali.
p132
aVBut you'll see here a blocked page
p133
aVof what happens when you try to reach
p134
aVcertain Facebook pages and some other websites
p135
aVthat the transitional authorities
p136
aVhave determined might incite violence.
p137
aVIn protest over this,
p138
aVblogger Slim Amamou,
p139
aVwho had been jailed under Ben Ali
p140
aVand then became part of the transitional government
p141
aVafter the revolution,
p142
aVhe resigned in protest from the cabinet.
p143
aVBut there's been a lot of debate in Tunisia
p144
aVabout how to handle this kind of problem.
p145
aa(lp146
VIn fact, on Twitter,
p147
aVthere were a number of people who were supportive of the revolution
p148
aVwho said, "Well actually,
p149
aVwe do want democracy and free expression,
p150
aVbut there is some kinds of speech that need to be off-bounds
p151
aVbecause it's too violent and it might be destabilizing for our democracy.
p152
aVBut the problem is,
p153
aVhow do you decide who is in power to make these decisions
p154
aVand how do you make sure
p155
aVthat they do not abuse their power?
p156
aVAs Riadh Guerfali,
p157
aVthe veteran digital activist from Tunisia,
p158
aVremarked over this incident,
p159
aV"Before, things were simple:
p160
aVyou had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other.
p161
aVToday, things are a lot more subtle."
p162
aVWelcome to democracy, our Tunisian and Egyptian friends.
p163
aa(lp164
VThe reality is
p165
aVthat even in democratic societies today,
p166
aVwe do not have good answers
p167
aVfor how you balance the need
p168
aVfor security and law enforcement on one hand
p169
aVand protection of civil liberties
p170
aVand free speech on the other
p171
aVin our digital networks.
p172
aVIn fact, in the United States,
p173
aVwhatever you may think of Julian Assange,
p174
aVeven people who are not necessarily big fans of his
p175
aVare very concerned about the way
p176
aVin which the United States government and some companies have handled Wikileaks.
p177
aVAmazon webhosting dropped Wikileaks as a customer
p178
aVafter receiving a complaint from U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman,
p179
aVdespite the fact
p180
aVthat Wikileaks had not been charged,
p181
aVlet alone convicted,
p182
aVof any crime.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo we assume
p185
aVthat the Internet is a border-busting technology.
p186
aVThis is a map of social networks worldwide,
p187
aVand certainly Facebook has conquered much of the world \u2014
p188
aVwhich is either a good or a bad thing,
p189
aVdepending on how you like
p190
aVthe way Facebook manages its service.
p191
aVBut borders do persist
p192
aVin some parts of cyberspace.
p193
aVIn Brazil and Japan,
p194
aVit's for unique cultural and linguistic reasons.
p195
aVBut if you look at China, Vietnam
p196
aVand a number of the former Soviet states,
p197
aVwhat's happening there is more troubling.
p198
aVYou have a situation
p199
aVwhere the relationship between government
p200
aVand local social networking companies
p201
aVis creating a situation
p202
aVwhere, effectively,
p203
aVthe empowering potential of these platforms
p204
aVis being constrained
p205
aVbecause of these relationships
p206
aVbetween companies and government.
p207
aa(lp208
VNow in China,
p209
aVyou have the "great firewall," as it's well-known,
p210
aVthat blocks Facebook
p211
aVand Twitter and now Google+
p212
aVand many of the other overseas websites.
p213
aVAnd that's done in part with the help from Western technology.
p214
aVBut that's only half of the story.
p215
aVThe other part of the story
p216
aVare requirements that the Chinese government places
p217
aVon all companies operating on the Chinese Internet,
p218
aVknown as a system of self-discipline.
p219
aVIn plain English, that means censorship and surveillance
p220
aVof their users.
p221
aVAnd this is a ceremony I actually attended in 2009
p222
aVwhere the Internet Society of China presented awards
p223
aVto the top 20 Chinese companies
p224
aVthat are best at exercising self-discipline \u2014
p225
aVi.e. policing their content.
p226
aVAnd Robin Li, CEO of Baidu,
p227
aVChina's dominant search engine,
p228
aVwas one of the recipients.
p229
aa(lp230
VIn Russia, they do not generally block the Internet
p231
aVand directly censor websites.
p232
aVBut this is a website called Rospil
p233
aVthat's an anti-corruption site.
p234
aVAnd earlier this year,
p235
aVthere was a troubling incident
p236
aVwhere people who had made donations to Rospil
p237
aVthrough a payments processing system
p238
aVcalled Yandex Money
p239
aVsuddenly received threatening phone calls
p240
aVfrom members of a nationalist party
p241
aVwho had obtained details
p242
aVabout donors to Rospil
p243
aVthrough members of the security services
p244
aVwho had somehow obtained this information
p245
aVfrom people at Yandex Money.
p246
aVThis has a chilling effect
p247
aVon people's ability to use the Internet
p248
aVto hold government accountable.
p249
aVSo we have a situation in the world today
p250
aVwhere in more and more countries
p251
aVthe relationship between citizens and governments
p252
aVis mediated through the Internet,
p253
aVwhich is comprised primarily
p254
aVof privately owned and operated services.
p255
aa(lp256
VSo the important question, I think,
p257
aVis not this debate over whether the Internet
p258
aVis going to help the good guys more than the bad guys.
p259
aVOf course, it's going to empower
p260
aVwhoever is most skilled at using the technology
p261
aVand best understands the Internet
p262
aVin comparison with whoever their adversary is.
p263
aVThe most urgent question we need to be asking today
p264
aVis how do we make sure
p265
aVthat the Internet evolves
p266
aVin a citizen-centric manner.
p267
aVBecause I think all of you will agree
p268
aVthat the only legitimate purpose of government
p269
aVis to serve citizens,
p270
aVand I would argue
p271
aVthat the only legitimate purpose of technology
p272
aVis to improve our lives,
p273
aVnot to manipulate or enslave us.
p274
aa(lp275
VSo the question is,
p276
aVwe know how to hold government accountable.
p277
aVWe don't necessarily always do it very well,
p278
aVbut we have a sense of what the models are,
p279
aVpolitically and institutionally, to do that.
p280
aVHow do you hold the sovereigns of cyberspace
p281
aVaccountable to the public interest
p282
aVwhen most CEO's argue
p283
aVthat their main obligation
p284
aVis to maximize shareholder profit?
p285
aa(lp286
VAnd government regulation
p287
aVoften isn't helping all that much.
p288
aVYou have situations, for instance, in France
p289
aVwhere president Sarkozy
p290
aVtells the CEO's of Internet companies,
p291
aV"We're the only legitimate representatives
p292
aVof the public interest."
p293
aVBut then he goes and champions laws
p294
aVlike the infamous "three-strikes" law
p295
aVthat would disconnect citizens from the Internet
p296
aVfor file sharing,
p297
aVwhich has been condemned by the U.N. Special Rapporteur
p298
aVon Freedom of Expression
p299
aVas being a disproportionate violation
p300
aVof citizens' right to communications,
p301
aVand has raised questions amongst civil society groups
p302
aVabout whether
p303
aVsome political representatives
p304
aVare more interested in preserving
p305
aVthe interests of the entertainment industry
p306
aVthan they are in defending the rights of their citizens.
p307
aVAnd here in the United Kingdom
p308
aVthere's also concern over
p309
aVa law called the Digital Economy Act
p310
aVthat's placing more onus
p311
aVon private intermediaries
p312
aVto police citizen behavior.
p313
aa(lp314
VSo what we need to recognize
p315
aVis that if we want to have
p316
aVa citizen-centric Internet in the future,
p317
aVwe need a broader and more sustained
p318
aVInternet freedom movement.
p319
aVAfter all, companies didn't stop polluting groundwater
p320
aVas a matter of course,
p321
aVor employing 10-year-olds as a matter of course,
p322
aVjust because executives woke up one day
p323
aVand decided it was the right thing to do.
p324
aVIt was the result of decades of sustained activism,
p325
aVshareholder advocacy
p326
aVand consumer advocacy.
p327
aVSimilarly, governments don't enact
p328
aVintelligent environmental and labor laws
p329
aVjust because politicians wake up one day.
p330
aVIt's the result of very sustained and prolonged
p331
aVpolitical activism
p332
aVthat you get the right regulations,
p333
aVand that you get the right corporate behavior.
p334
aVWe need to make the same approach
p335
aVwith the Internet.
p336
aa(lp337
VWe also are going to need
p338
aVpolitical innovation.
p339
aVEight hundred years ago, approximately,
p340
aVthe barons of England decided
p341
aVthat the Divine Right of Kings
p342
aVwas no longer working for them so well,
p343
aVand they forced King John
p344
aVto sign the Magna Carta,
p345
aVwhich recognized
p346
aVthat even the king
p347
aVwho claimed to have divine rule
p348
aVstill had to abide by a basic set of rules.
p349
aVThis set off a cycle
p350
aVof what we can call political innovation,
p351
aVwhich led eventually to the idea of consent of the governed \u2014
p352
aVwhich was implemented for the first time
p353
aVby that radical revolutionary government
p354
aVin America across the pond.
p355
aVSo now we need to figure out
p356
aVhow to build consent of the networked.
p357
aa(lp358
VAnd what does that look like?
p359
aVAt the moment, we still don't know.
p360
aVBut it's going to require innovation
p361
aVthat's not only going to need
p362
aVto focus on politics,
p363
aVon geopolitics,
p364
aVbut it's also going to need
p365
aVto deal with questions
p366
aVof business management, investor behavior,
p367
aVconsumer choice
p368
aVand even software design and engineering.
p369
aVEach and every one of us has a vital part to play
p370
aVin building the kind of world
p371
aVin which government and technology
p372
aVserve the world's people and not the other way around.
p373
aa(lp374
VThank you very much.

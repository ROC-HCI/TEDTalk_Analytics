VA month ago today
p5
aVI stood there:
p6
aV90 degrees south, the top of
p7
aVthe bottom of the world, the Geographic South Pole.
p8
aVAnd I stood there beside two very good friends of mine,
p9
aVRichard Weber and Kevin Vallely.
p10
aVTogether we had just broken the world speed record
p11
aVfor a trek to the South Pole.
p12
aVIt took us 33 days,
p13
aV23 hours and 55 minutes to get there.
p14
aVWe shaved five days off the previous best time.
p15
aVAnd in the process, I became the first person in history
p16
aVto make the entire 650-mile journey,
p17
aVfrom Hercules Inlet to South Pole,
p18
aVsolely on feet, without skis.
p19
aa(lp20
VNow, many of you are probably saying, "Wait a sec,
p21
aVis this tough to do?"
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aVImagine, if you will,
p24
aVdragging a sled, as you just saw in that video clip,
p25
aVwith 170 pounds of gear,
p26
aVin it everything you need to survive on your Antarctic trek.
p27
aVIt's going to be 40 below, every single day.
p28
aVYou'll be in a massive headwind.
p29
aVAnd at some point you're going to have to cross these cracks in the ice,
p30
aVthese crevasses.
p31
aVSome of them have a very precarious thin footbridge underneath them
p32
aVthat could give way at a moment's notice,
p33
aVtaking your sled, you, into the abyss, never to be seen again.
p34
aVThe punchline to your journey? Look at the horizon.
p35
aVYes, it's uphill the entire way,
p36
aVbecause the South Pole is at 10,000 feet,
p37
aVand you're starting at sea level.
p38
aa(lp39
VOur journey did not, in fact, begin at Hercules Inlet,
p40
aVwhere frozen ocean meets the land of Antarctica.
p41
aVIt began a little less than two years ago.
p42
aVA couple of buddies of mine and I
p43
aVhad finished a 111-day run across the entire Sahara desert.
p44
aVAnd while we were there we learned
p45
aVthe seriousness of the water crisis in Northern Africa.
p46
aVWe also learned that many of the issues facing the people of Northern Africa
p47
aVaffected young people the most.
p48
aVI came home to my wife after 111 days of running in the sand,
p49
aVand I said, "You know, there's no doubt if this bozo can get across the desert,
p50
aVwe are capable of doing anything we set our minds to."
p51
aVBut if I'm going to continue doing these adventures, there has to be
p52
aVa reason for me to do them
p53
aVbeyond just getting there.
p54
aa(lp55
VAround that time I met an extraordinary human being,
p56
aVPeter Thum, who inspired me with his actions.
p57
aVHe's trying to find and solve water issues, the crisis around the world.
p58
aVHis dedication inspired me to come up with this expedition:
p59
aVa run to the South Pole
p60
aVwhere, with an interactive website,
p61
aVI will be able to bring young people, students and teachers from around the world
p62
aVon board the expedition with me,
p63
aVas active members.
p64
aVSo we would have a live website, that every single day of the 33 days,
p65
aVwe would be blogging, telling stories of,
p66
aVyou know, depleted ozone forcing us to cover our faces,
p67
aVor we will burn.
p68
aVCrossing miles and miles of sastrugi \u2014
p69
aVfrozen ice snowdrifts that could be hip-deep.
p70
aVI'm telling you, crossing these things with 170-pound sled,
p71
aVthat sled may as well have weighed 1,700 pounds,
p72
aVbecause that's what it felt like.
p73
aa(lp74
VWe were blogging to this live website daily
p75
aVto these students that were tracking us as well,
p76
aVabout 10-hour trekking days,
p77
aV15-hour trekking days,
p78
aVsometimes 20 hours of trekking daily to meet our goal.
p79
aVWe'd catch cat-naps at 40 below on our sled, incidentally.
p80
aVIn turn, students,
p81
aVpeople from around the world, would ask us questions.
p82
aVYoung people would ask the most amazing questions.
p83
aa(lp84
VOne of my favorite: It's 40 below, you've got to go to the bathroom,
p85
aVwhere are you going to go and how are you going to do it?
p86
aVI'm not going to answer that. But I will answer some of the more popular questions.
p87
aa(lp88
VWhere do you sleep? We slept in a tent that was very low to the ground,
p89
aVbecause the winds on Antarctica were so extreme, it would blow anything else away.
p90
aa(lp91
VWhat do you eat? One of my favorite dishes on expedition:
p92
aVbutter and bacon. It's about a million calories.
p93
aVWe were burning about 8,500 a day,
p94
aVso we needed it.
p95
aa(lp96
VHow many batteries do you carry for all the equipment that you have?
p97
aVVirtually none. All of our equipment, including film equipment,
p98
aVwas charged by the sun.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd do you get along? I certainly hope so,
p101
aVbecause at some point or another on this expedition,
p102
aVone of your teammates is going to have to take a very big needle,
p103
aVand put it in an infected blister, and drain it for you.
p104
aa(lp105
VBut seriously, seriously, we did get along,
p106
aVbecause we had a common goal of wanting to inspire these young people.
p107
aVThey were our teammates! They were inspiring us.
p108
aVThe stories we were hearing got us to the South Pole.
p109
aVThe website worked brilliantly as a two-way street of communication.
p110
aVYoung people in northern Canada, kids in an elementary school,
p111
aVdragging sleds across the school-yard,
p112
aVpretending they were Richard, Ray and Kevin. Amazing.
p113
aa(lp114
VWe arrived at the South Pole. We huddled into that tent,
p115
aV45 below that day, I'll never forget it.
p116
aVWe looked at each other with these looks
p117
aVof disbelief at what we had just completed.
p118
aVAnd I remember looking at the guys thinking,
p119
aV"What do I take from this journey?" You know? Seriously.
p120
aVThat I'm this uber-endurance guy?
p121
aa(lp122
VAs I stand here today talking to you guys,
p123
aVI've been running for the grand sum of five years.
p124
aVAnd a year before that I was a pack-a-day smoker,
p125
aVliving a very sedentary lifestyle.
p126
aVWhat I take from this journey, from my journeys,
p127
aVis that, in fact,
p128
aVwithin every fiber of my belief standing here,
p129
aVI know that we can make the impossible possible.
p130
aVI'm learning this at 40.
p131
aVCan you imagine? Seriously, can you imagine?
p132
aVI'm learning this at 40 years of age.
p133
aVImagine being 13 years old,
p134
aVhearing those words, and believing it.
p135
aVThank you very much. Thank you.

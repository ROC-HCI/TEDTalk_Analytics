V(Nature sounds)
p5
aVWhen I first began recording wild soundscapes
p6
aV45 years ago,
p7
aVI had no idea that ants,
p8
aVinsect larvae, sea anemones and viruses
p9
aVcreated a sound signature.
p10
aVBut they do.
p11
aVAnd so does every wild habitat on the planet,
p12
aVlike the Amazon rainforest you're hearing behind me.
p13
aVIn fact, temperate and tropical rainforests
p14
aVeach produce a vibrant animal orchestra,
p15
aVthat instantaneous and organized expression
p16
aVof insects, reptiles, amphibians, birds and mammals.
p17
aVAnd every soundscape that springs from a wild habitat
p18
aVgenerates its own unique signature,
p19
aVone that contains incredible amounts of information,
p20
aVand it's some of that information I want to share with you today.
p21
aVThe soundscape is made up of three basic sources.
p22
aVThe first is the geophony,
p23
aVor the nonbiological sounds that occur
p24
aVin any given habitat,
p25
aVlike wind in the trees, water in a stream,
p26
aVwaves at the ocean shore, movement of the Earth.
p27
aVThe second of these is the biophony.
p28
aVThe biophony is all of the sound
p29
aVthat's generated by organisms in a given habitat
p30
aVat one time and in one place.
p31
aVAnd the third is all of the sound that we humans generate
p32
aVthat's called anthrophony.
p33
aVSome of it is controlled, like music or theater,
p34
aVbut most of it is chaotic and incoherent,
p35
aVwhich some of us refer to as noise.
p36
aVThere was a time when I considered wild soundscapes
p37
aVto be a worthless artifact.
p38
aVThey were just there, but they had no significance.
p39
aVWell, I was wrong. What I learned from these encounters
p40
aVwas that careful listening gives us incredibly valuable tools
p41
aVby which to evaluate the health of a habitat
p42
aVacross the entire spectrum of life.
p43
aVWhen I began recording in the late '60s,
p44
aVthe typical methods of recording were limited
p45
aVto the fragmented capture of individual species
p46
aVlike birds mostly, in the beginning,
p47
aVbut later animals like mammals and amphibians.
p48
aVTo me, this was a little like trying to understand
p49
aVthe magnificence of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony
p50
aVby abstracting the sound of a single violin player
p51
aVout of the context of the orchestra
p52
aVand hearing just that one part.
p53
aVFortunately, more and more institutions
p54
aVare implementing the more holistic models
p55
aVthat I and a few of my colleagues have introduced
p56
aVto the field of soundscape ecology.
p57
aVWhen I began recording over four decades ago,
p58
aVI could record for 10 hours
p59
aVand capture one hour of usable material,
p60
aVgood enough for an album or a film soundtrack
p61
aVor a museum installation.
p62
aVNow, because of global warming,
p63
aVresource extraction,
p64
aVand human noise, among many other factors,
p65
aVit can take up to 1,000 hours or more
p66
aVto capture the same thing.
p67
aVFully 50 percent of my archive
p68
aVcomes from habitats so radically altered
p69
aVthat they're either altogether silent
p70
aVor can no longer be heard in any of their original form.
p71
aVThe usual methods of evaluating a habitat
p72
aVhave been done by visually counting the numbers of species
p73
aVand the numbers of individuals within each species in a given area.
p74
aVHowever, by comparing data that ties together
p75
aVboth density and diversity from what we hear,
p76
aVI'm able to arrive at much more precise fitness outcomes.
p77
aVAnd I want to show you some examples
p78
aVthat typify the possibilities unlocked
p79
aVby diving into this universe.
p80
aVThis is Lincoln Meadow.
p81
aVLincoln Meadow's a three-and-a-half-hour drive
p82
aVeast of San Francisco in the Sierra Nevada Mountains,
p83
aVat about 2,000 meters altitude,
p84
aVand I've been recording there for many years.
p85
aVIn 1988, a logging company convinced local residents
p86
aVthat there would be absolutely no environmental impact
p87
aVfrom a new method they were trying
p88
aVcalled "selective logging,"
p89
aVtaking out a tree here and there
p90
aVrather than clear-cutting a whole area.
p91
aVWith permission granted to record
p92
aVboth before and after the operation,
p93
aVI set up my gear and captured a large number of dawn choruses
p94
aVto very strict protocol and calibrated recordings,
p95
aVbecause I wanted a really good baseline.
p96
aVThis is an example of a spectrogram.
p97
aVA spectrogram is a graphic illustration of sound
p98
aVwith time from left to right across the page \u2014
p99
aV15 seconds in this case is represented \u2014
p100
aVand frequency from the bottom of the page to the top,
p101
aVlowest to highest.
p102
aVAnd you can see that the signature of a stream
p103
aVis represented here in the bottom third or half of the page,
p104
aVwhile birds that were once in that meadow
p105
aVare represented in the signature across the top.
p106
aVThere were a lot of them.
p107
aVAnd here's Lincoln Meadow before selective logging.
p108
aV(Nature sounds)
p109
aVWell, a year later I returned,
p110
aVand using the same protocols
p111
aVand recording under the same conditions,
p112
aVI recorded a number of examples
p113
aVof the same dawn choruses,
p114
aVand now this is what we've got.
p115
aVThis is after selective logging.
p116
aVYou can see that the stream is still represented
p117
aVin the bottom third of the page,
p118
aVbut notice what's missing in the top two thirds.
p119
aV(Nature sounds)
p120
aVComing up is the sound of a woodpecker.
p121
aVWell, I've returned to Lincoln Meadow 15 times
p122
aVin the last 25 years,
p123
aVand I can tell you that the biophony,
p124
aVthe density and diversity of that biophony,
p125
aVhas not yet returned to anything like it was
p126
aVbefore the operation.
p127
aVBut here's a picture of Lincoln Meadow taken after,
p128
aVand you can see that from the perspective of the camera
p129
aVor the human eye,
p130
aVhardly a stick or a tree appears to be out of place,
p131
aVwhich would confirm the logging company's contention
p132
aVthat there's nothing of environmental impact.
p133
aVHowever, our ears tell us a very different story.
p134
aVYoung students are always asking me
p135
aVwhat these animals are saying,
p136
aVand really I've got no idea.
p137
aVBut I can tell you that they do express themselves.
p138
aVWhether or not we understand it is a different story.
p139
aVI was walking along the shore in Alaska,
p140
aVand I came across this tide pool
p141
aVfilled with a colony of sea anemones,
p142
aVthese wonderful eating machines,
p143
aVrelatives of coral and jellyfish.
p144
aVAnd curious to see if any of them made any noise,
p145
aVI dropped a hydrophone,
p146
aVan underwater microphone covered in rubber,
p147
aVdown the mouth part,
p148
aVand immediately the critter began
p149
aVto absorb the microphone into its belly,
p150
aVand the tentacles were searching out of the surface
p151
aVfor something of nutritional value.
p152
aVThe static-like sounds that are very low,
p153
aVthat you're going to hear right now.
p154
aV(Static sounds)
p155
aVYeah, but watch. When it didn't find anything to eat \u2014
p156
aV(Honking sound)
p157
aV(Laughter)
p158
aVI think that's an expression that can be understood
p159
aVin any language.
p160
aV(Laughter)
p161
aVAt the end of its breeding cycle,
p162
aVthe Great Basin Spadefoot toad
p163
aVdigs itself down about a meter under
p164
aVthe hard-panned desert soil of the American West,
p165
aVwhere it can stay for many seasons
p166
aVuntil conditions are just right for it to emerge again.
p167
aVAnd when there's enough moisture in the soil
p168
aVin the spring, frogs will dig themselves to the surface
p169
aVand gather around these large, vernal pools
p170
aVin great numbers.
p171
aVAnd they vocalize in a chorus
p172
aVthat's absolutely in sync with one another.
p173
aVAnd they do that for two reasons.
p174
aVThe first is competitive, because they're looking for mates,
p175
aVand the second is cooperative,
p176
aVbecause if they're all vocalizing in sync together,
p177
aVit makes it really difficult for predators like coyotes,
p178
aVfoxes and owls to single out any individual for a meal.
p179
aVThis is a spectrogram of what the frog chorusing looks like
p180
aVwhen it's in a very healthy pattern.
p181
aV(Frogs croaking)
p182
aVMono Lake is just to the east of Yosemite National Park
p183
aVin California,
p184
aVand it's a favorite habitat of these toads,
p185
aVand it's also favored by U.S. Navy jet pilots,
p186
aVwho train in their fighters flying them at speeds
p187
aVexceeding 1,100 kilometers an hour
p188
aVand altitudes only a couple hundred meters
p189
aVabove ground level of the Mono Basin,
p190
aVvery fast, very low, and so loud
p191
aVthat the anthrophony, the human noise,
p192
aVeven though it's six and a half kilometers
p193
aVfrom the frog pond you just heard a second ago,
p194
aVit masked the sound of the chorusing toads.
p195
aVYou can see in this spectrogram that all of the energy
p196
aVthat was once in the first spectrogram is gone
p197
aVfrom the top end of the spectrogram,
p198
aVand that there's breaks in the chorusing at two and a half,
p199
aVfour and a half, and six and a half seconds,
p200
aVand then the sound of the jet, the signature,
p201
aVis in yellow at the very bottom of the page.
p202
aV(Frogs croaking)
p203
aVNow at the end of that flyby,
p204
aVit took the frogs fully 45 minutes
p205
aVto regain their chorusing synchronicity,
p206
aVduring which time, and under a full moon,
p207
aVwe watched as two coyotes and a great horned owl
p208
aVcame in to pick off a few of their numbers.
p209
aVThe good news is that, with a little bit of habitat restoration
p210
aVand fewer flights, the frog populations,
p211
aVonce diminishing during the 1980s and early '90s,
p212
aVhave pretty much returned to normal.
p213
aVI want to end with a story told by a beaver.
p214
aVIt's a very sad story,
p215
aVbut it really illustrates how animals
p216
aVcan sometimes show emotion,
p217
aVa very controversial subject among some older biologists.
p218
aVA colleague of mine was recording in the American Midwest
p219
aVaround this pond that had been formed
p220
aVmaybe 16,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age.
p221
aVIt was also formed in part by a beaver dam
p222
aVat one end that held that whole ecosystem together
p223
aVin a very delicate balance.
p224
aVAnd one afternoon, while he was recording,
p225
aVthere suddenly appeared from out of nowhere
p226
aVa couple of game wardens,
p227
aVwho for no apparent reason,
p228
aVwalked over to the beaver dam,
p229
aVdropped a stick of dynamite down it, blowing it up,
p230
aVkilling the female and her young babies.
p231
aVHorrified, my colleagues remained behind
p232
aVto gather his thoughts
p233
aVand to record whatever he could the rest of the afternoon,
p234
aVand that evening, he captured a remarkable event:
p235
aVthe lone surviving male beaver swimming in slow circles
p236
aVcrying out inconsolably for its lost mate and offspring.
p237
aVThis is probably the saddest sound
p238
aVI've ever heard coming from any organism,
p239
aVhuman or other.
p240
aV(Beaver crying)
p241
aVYeah. Well.
p242
aVThere are many facets to soundscapes,
p243
aVamong them the ways in which animals taught us to dance and sing,
p244
aVwhich I'll save for another time.
p245
aVBut you have heard how biophonies
p246
aVhelp clarify our understanding of the natural world.
p247
aVYou've heard the impact of resource extraction,
p248
aVhuman noise and habitat destruction.
p249
aVAnd where environmental sciences have typically
p250
aVtried to understand the world from what we see,
p251
aVa much fuller understanding can be got from what we hear.
p252
aVBiophonies and geophonies are the signature voices
p253
aVof the natural world,
p254
aVand as we hear them,
p255
aVwe're endowed with a sense of place,
p256
aVthe true story of the world we live in.
p257
aVIn a matter of seconds,
p258
aVa soundscape reveals much more information
p259
aVfrom many perspectives,
p260
aVfrom quantifiable data to cultural inspiration.
p261
aVVisual capture implicitly frames
p262
aVa limited frontal perspective of a given spatial context,
p263
aVwhile soundscapes widen that scope
p264
aVto a full 360 degrees, completely enveloping us.
p265
aVAnd while a picture may be worth 1,000 words,
p266
aVa soundscape is worth 1,000 pictures.
p267
aVAnd our ears tell us
p268
aVthat the whisper of every leaf and creature
p269
aVspeaks to the natural sources of our lives,
p270
aVwhich indeed may hold the secrets of love for all things,
p271
aVespecially our own humanity,
p272
aVand the last word goes to a jaguar from the Amazon.
p273
aV(Growling)
p274
aVThank you for listening.

VI love paper, and I love technology,
p5
aVand what I do is I make paper interactive.
p6
aVAnd that's what I say when people ask me what I do,
p7
aVbut it really confuses most people,
p8
aVso really, the best way for me to convey it
p9
aVis to take the technology and be creative
p10
aVand create experiences.
p11
aVSo I tried to think what I could use for here,
p12
aVand a couple of weeks ago I had a crazy idea
p13
aVthat I wanted to print two DJ decks
p14
aVand to try and mix some music.
p15
aVAnd I'm going to try and show that at the end,
p16
aVand the suspense will be as much mine if it works.
p17
aVAnd I'm not a DJ, and I'm not a musician,
p18
aVso I'm a little bit scared of that.
p19
aVSo I think, I found the best way to describe my journey
p20
aVis just to mention a few little things
p21
aVthat have happened to me throughout my life.
p22
aVThere's three particular things that I've done,
p23
aVand I'll just describe those first,
p24
aVand then talk about some of my work.
p25
aVSo when I was a kid, I was obsessed with wires,
p26
aVand I used to thread them under my carpet
p27
aVand thread them behind the walls
p28
aVand have little switches and little speakers,
p29
aVand I wanted to make my bedroom be interactive
p30
aVbut kind of all hidden away.
p31
aVAnd I was also really interested in wireless as well.
p32
aVSo I bought one of those little kits that you could get
p33
aVto make a radio transmitter,
p34
aVand I got an old book and I carved out the inside
p35
aVand I hid it inside there,
p36
aVand then I placed it next to my dad
p37
aVand snuck back to my bedroom and tuned in on the radio
p38
aVso I could eavesdrop.
p39
aVI was not at all interested in what he was saying.
p40
aVIt's more that I just liked the idea
p41
aVof an everyday object
p42
aVhaving something inside
p43
aVand doing something different.
p44
aVSeveral year later,
p45
aVI managed to successfully fail all of my exams
p46
aVand didn't really leave school with much to show for at all,
p47
aVand my parents, maybe as a reward,
p48
aVbought me what turned out to be
p49
aVa one-way ticket to Australia,
p50
aVand I came back home about four years later.
p51
aVI ended up on a farm in the middle of nowhere.
p52
aVIt was in far western New South Wales.
p53
aVAnd this farm was 120,000 acres.
p54
aVThere were 22,000 sheep,
p55
aVand it was about 40 degrees,
p56
aVor 100 or so Fahrenheit.
p57
aVAnd on this farm there was the farmer, his wife,
p58
aVand there was the four-year-old daughter.
p59
aVAnd they kind of took me into the farm
p60
aVand showed me what it was like to live and work.
p61
aVObviously, one of the most important things was the sheep,
p62
aVand so my job was, well, pretty much to do everything,
p63
aVbut it was about bringing the sheep back to the homestead.
p64
aVAnd we'd do that by building fences,
p65
aVusing motorbikes and horses,
p66
aVand the sheep would make their way all the way back
p67
aVto the shearing shed for the different seasons.
p68
aVAnd what I learned was,
p69
aValthough at the time, like everyone else,
p70
aVI thought sheep were pretty stupid
p71
aVbecause they didn't do what we wanted them to do,
p72
aVwhat I realize now, probably only just in the last few weeks
p73
aVlooking back, is the sheep weren't stupid at all.
p74
aVWe'd put them in an environment where they didn't want to be,
p75
aVand they didn't want to do what we wanted them to do.
p76
aVSo the challenge was to try and get them
p77
aVto do what we wanted them to do
p78
aVby listening to the weather, the lay of the land,
p79
aVand creating things that would let the sheep flow
p80
aVand go where we wanted them to go.
p81
aVAnother bunch of years later,
p82
aVI ended up at Cambridge University
p83
aVat the Cavendish Laboratory in the U.K.
p84
aVdoing a Ph.D. in physics.
p85
aVMy Ph.D. was to move electrons around, one at a time.
p86
aVAnd I realize \u2014 again, it's kind of these realizations
p87
aVlooking back as to what I did \u2014
p88
aVI realize now that it was pretty much the same
p89
aVas moving sheep around.
p90
aVIt really is.
p91
aVIt's just you do it by changing an environment.
p92
aVAnd that's kind of been a big lesson to me,
p93
aVthat you can't act on any object.
p94
aVYou change its environment, and the object will flow.
p95
aVSo we made it very small,
p96
aVso things were about 30 nanometers in size;
p97
aVmaking it very cold, so at liquid helium temperatures;
p98
aVand changing environment by changing the voltage,
p99
aVand the electrons could make flow around a loop
p100
aVone at a time, on and off, a little memory node.
p101
aVAnd I wanted to go one step further,
p102
aVand I wanted to move one electron on
p103
aVand one electron off.
p104
aVAnd I was told that I wouldn't be able to do this,
p105
aVwhich, you know, as we've heard from other people,
p106
aVthat's the thing that makes you do it.
p107
aVAnd I was determined, and I managed to show that I could do that.
p108
aVAnd a lot of that learning, I think,
p109
aVcame from being on that farm,
p110
aVbecause when I was working on the farm,
p111
aVwe'd have to use what was around us,
p112
aVwe'd have to use the environment,
p113
aVand there was no such thing
p114
aVas something can't be done,
p115
aVbecause you're in an environment where,
p116
aVif you can't do what you need to do,
p117
aVyou can die, and, you know,
p118
aVI had seen that sort of thing happen.
p119
aVSo now my obsession is printing,
p120
aVand I'm really fascinated by the idea
p121
aVof using conventional printing processes,
p122
aVso the types of print that are used to create
p123
aVmany of the things around us
p124
aVto make paper and card interactive.
p125
aVWhen I spoke to some printers when I started doing this
p126
aVand told them what I wanted to do,
p127
aVwhich was to print conductive inks onto paper,
p128
aVthey told me it couldn't be done,
p129
aVagain, that kind of favorite thing.
p130
aVSo I got about 10 credit cards and loans
p131
aVand got myself very close to bankruptcy, really,
p132
aVand bought myself this huge printing press,
p133
aVwhich I had no idea how to use at all.
p134
aVIt was about five meters long,
p135
aVand I covered myself and the floor with ink
p136
aVand made a massive mess, but I learned to print.
p137
aVAnd then I took it back to the printers and showed them what I've done,
p138
aVand they were like, "Of course you can do that.
p139
aVWhy didn't you come here in the first place?"
p140
aVThat's always the case.
p141
aVSo what we do is we take conventional printing presses,
p142
aVwe make conductive inks,
p143
aVand run those through a press, and basically
p144
aVjust letting hundreds of thousands of electrons flow
p145
aVthrough pieces of paper
p146
aVso we can make that paper interactive.
p147
aVAnd it's pretty simple, really.
p148
aVIt's just a collection of things that have been done before,
p149
aVbut bringing them together in a different way.
p150
aVSo we have a piece of paper with conductive ink on,
p151
aVand then add onto that a small circuit board with a couple of chips,
p152
aVone to run some capacitive touch software,
p153
aVso we know where we've touched it,
p154
aVand the other to run, quite often,
p155
aVsome wireless software so the piece of paper can connect.
p156
aVSo I'll just describe a couple of things that we've created.
p157
aVThere's lots of different things we've created.
p158
aVThis is one of them, because I love cake.
p159
aVAnd this one, it's a large poster,
p160
aVand you touch it and it has a little speaker behind it,
p161
aVand the poster talks to you when you touch it
p162
aVand asks you a series of questions,
p163
aVand it works out your perfect cake.
p164
aVBut it doesn't tell you the cake there and then.
p165
aVIt uploads a picture,
p166
aVand the reason why it chose that cake for you,
p167
aVto our Facebook page and to Twitter.
p168
aVSo we're trying to create that connection
p169
aVbetween the physical and the digital,
p170
aVbut have it not looking on a screen,
p171
aVand just looking like a regular poster.
p172
aVWe've worked with a bunch of universities on a project
p173
aVlooking at interactive newsprint.
p174
aVSo for example, we've created a newspaper,
p175
aVa regular newspaper.
p176
aVYou can wear a pair of headphones that are connected to it wirelessly,
p177
aVand when you touch it, you can hear the music
p178
aVthat's described on the top, which is something you can't read.
p179
aVYou can hear a press conference
p180
aVas well as reading what the editor has determined
p181
aVthat press conference was about.
p182
aVAnd you can press a Facebook "like" button
p183
aVor you can vote on something as well.
p184
aVSomething else that we created,
p185
aVand this was an idea that I had a couple of years ago,
p186
aVand so we've done a project on this.
p187
aVIt was for funding from the government
p188
aVfor user-centered design for energy-efficient buildings,
p189
aVdifficult to say, and something I had no idea what it was
p190
aVwhen I went into the workshop, but quickly learned.
p191
aVAnd we wanted to try and encourage people
p192
aVto use energy better.
p193
aVAnd I really liked the idea that, instead of looking at dials
p194
aVand reading things to say \u2014
p195
aVlooking at your energy usage,
p196
aVI wanted to create a poster that was wirelessly connected
p197
aVand had color-changing inks on it,
p198
aVand so if your energy usage was trending better,
p199
aVthan the leaves would appear and the rabbits would appear
p200
aVand all would be good.
p201
aVAnd if it wasn't, then there'd be graffiti
p202
aVand the leaves would fall off the trees.
p203
aVSo it was trying to make you look after something
p204
aVin your immediate environment,
p205
aVwhich you don't want to see not looking so good,
p206
aVrather than expecting people to do things
p207
aVin the local environment because of the effect
p208
aVthat it has a long way off.
p209
aVAnd I think, kind of like going back to the farm,
p210
aVit's about how to let people do what you want them to do
p211
aVrather than making people do what you want them to do.
p212
aVOkay.
p213
aVSo this is the bit I'm really scared of.
p214
aVSo a couple of things I've created are,
p215
aVthere's a poster over here
p216
aVthat you can play drums on.
p217
aVAnd I am not a musician. It seemed like a good idea at the time.
p218
aVIf anyone wants to try and play drums, then they can.
p219
aVI'll just describe how this works.
p220
aVThis poster is wirelessly connected to my cell phone,
p221
aVand when you touch it, it connects to the app.
p222
aV(Drums)
p223
aVAnd it has really good response time.
p224
aVIt's using Bluetooth 4, so it's pretty instantaneous.
p225
aVOkay. Thanks.
p226
aV(Applause)
p227
aVAnd there's a couple of other things.
p228
aVSo this one is like a sound board,
p229
aVso you can touch it, and I just love these horrible noises.
p230
aV(Sirens, explosions, breaking glass)
p231
aVOkay, and this is a D.J. turntable.
p232
aVSo it's wirelessly linked to my iPad,
p233
aVand this is a software that's running on the iPad.
p234
aVOh, yes. I just love doing that.
p235
aVI'm not a D.J., though, but I just always wanted to do that.
p236
aV(Scratching)
p237
aVSo I have a crossfader, and I have the two decks.
p238
aVSo I've made some new technology,
p239
aVand I love things being creative,
p240
aVand I love working with creative people.
p241
aVSo my 15-year-old niece, she's amazing,
p242
aVand she's called Charlotte,
p243
aVand I asked her to record something,
p244
aVand I worked with a friend called Elliot
p245
aVto put some beats together.
p246
aVSo this is my niece, Charlotte.
p247
aV(Music)
p248
aVYay!
p249
aV(Applause)
p250
aVSo that's pretty much what I do.
p251
aVI just love bringing technology together,
p252
aVhaving a lot of fun, being creative.
p253
aVBut it's not about the technology.
p254
aVIt's just about, I want to create some great experiences.
p255
aVSo thank you very much.
p256
aV(Applause)

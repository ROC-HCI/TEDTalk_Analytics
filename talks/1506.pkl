VSo, how many of you have ever
p5
aVgotten behind the wheel of a car
p6
aVwhen you really shouldn't have been driving?
p7
aVMaybe you're out on the road for a long day,
p8
aVand you just wanted to get home.
p9
aVYou were tired, but you felt you could drive a few more miles.
p10
aVMaybe you thought,
p11
aVI've had less to drink than everybody else,
p12
aVI should be the one to go home.
p13
aVOr maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere.
p14
aa(lp15
VDoes this sound familiar to you?
p16
aVNow, in those situations, wouldn't it be great
p17
aVif there was a button on your dashboard
p18
aVthat you could push, and the car would get you home safely?
p19
aVNow, that's been the promise of the self-driving car,
p20
aVthe autonomous vehicle, and it's been the dream
p21
aVsince at least 1939, when General Motors showcased
p22
aVthis idea at their Futurama booth at the World's Fair.
p23
aa(lp24
VNow, it's been one of those dreams
p25
aVthat's always seemed about 20 years in the future.
p26
aVNow, two weeks ago, that dream took a step forward,
p27
aVwhen the state of Nevada granted Google's self-driving car
p28
aVthe very first license for an autonomous vehicle,
p29
aVclearly establishing that it's legal for them
p30
aVto test it on the roads in Nevada.
p31
aVNow, California's considering similar legislation,
p32
aVand this would make sure that the autonomous car
p33
aVis not one of those things that has to stay in Vegas.
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VNow, in my lab at Stanford, we've been working on
p38
aVautonomous cars too, but with a slightly different spin
p39
aVon things. You see, we've been developing robotic race cars,
p40
aVcars that can actually push themselves to the very limits
p41
aVof physical performance.
p42
aa(lp43
VNow, why would we want to do such a thing?
p44
aVWell, there's two really good reasons for this.
p45
aVFirst, we believe that before people turn over control
p46
aVto an autonomous car, that autonomous car should be
p47
aVat least as good as the very best human drivers.
p48
aVNow, if you're like me, and the other 70 percent of the population
p49
aVwho know that we are above-average drivers,
p50
aVyou understand that's a very high bar.
p51
aVThere's another reason as well.
p52
aVJust like race car drivers can use all of the friction
p53
aVbetween the tire and the road,
p54
aVall of the car's capabilities to go as fast as possible,
p55
aVwe want to use all of those capabilities to avoid
p56
aVany accident we can.
p57
aa(lp58
VNow, you may push the car to the limits
p59
aVnot because you're driving too fast,
p60
aVbut because you've hit an icy patch of road,
p61
aVconditions have changed.
p62
aVIn those situations, we want a car
p63
aVthat is capable enough to avoid any accident
p64
aVthat can physically be avoided.
p65
aa(lp66
VI must confess, there's kind of a third motivation as well.
p67
aVYou see, I have a passion for racing.
p68
aVIn the past, I've been a race car owner,
p69
aVa crew chief and a driving coach,
p70
aValthough maybe not at the level that you're currently expecting.
p71
aVOne of the things that we've developed in the lab \u2014
p72
aVwe've developed several vehicles \u2014
p73
aVis what we believe is the world's first
p74
aVautonomously drifting car.
p75
aVIt's another one of those categories
p76
aVwhere maybe there's not a lot of competition.
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
VBut this is P1. It's an entirely student-built electric vehicle,
p81
aVwhich through using its rear-wheel drive
p82
aVand front-wheel steer-by-wire
p83
aVcan drift around corners.
p84
aVIt can get sideways like a rally car driver,
p85
aValways able to take the tightest curve,
p86
aVeven on slippery, changing surfaces,
p87
aVnever spinning out.
p88
aa(lp89
VWe've also worked with Volkswagen Oracle,
p90
aVon Shelley, an autonomous race car that has raced
p91
aVat 150 miles an hour through the Bonneville Salt Flats,
p92
aVgone around Thunderhill Raceway Park in the sun,
p93
aVthe wind and the rain,
p94
aVand navigated the 153 turns and 12.4 miles
p95
aVof the Pikes Peak Hill Climb route
p96
aVin Colorado with nobody at the wheel.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
V(Applause)
p101
aa(lp102
VI guess it goes without saying that we've had a lot of fun
p103
aVdoing this.
p104
aVBut in fact, there's something else that we've developed
p105
aVin the process of developing these autonomous cars.
p106
aVWe have developed a tremendous appreciation
p107
aVfor the capabilities of human race car drivers.
p108
aVAs we've looked at the question of how well do these cars perform,
p109
aVwe wanted to compare them to our human counterparts.
p110
aVAnd we discovered their human counterparts are amazing.
p111
aVNow, we can take a map of a race track,
p112
aVwe can take a mathematical model of a car,
p113
aVand with some iteration, we can actually find
p114
aVthe fastest way around that track.
p115
aVWe line that up with data that we record
p116
aVfrom a professional driver,
p117
aVand the resemblance is absolutely remarkable.
p118
aa(lp119
VYes, there are subtle differences here,
p120
aVbut the human race car driver is able to go out
p121
aVand drive an amazingly fast line,
p122
aVwithout the benefit of an algorithm that compares
p123
aVthe trade-off between going as fast as possible
p124
aVin this corner, and shaving a little bit of time
p125
aVoff of the straight over here.
p126
aVNot only that, they're able to do it lap
p127
aVafter lap after lap.
p128
aVThey're able to go out and consistently do this,
p129
aVpushing the car to the limits every single time.
p130
aVIt's extraordinary to watch.
p131
aVYou put them in a new car,
p132
aVand after a few laps, they've found the fastest line in that car,
p133
aVand they're off to the races.
p134
aa(lp135
VIt really makes you think,
p136
aVwe'd love to know what's going on inside their brain.
p137
aVSo as researchers, that's what we decided to find out.
p138
aVWe decided to instrument not only the car,
p139
aVbut also the race car driver,
p140
aVto try to get a glimpse into what was going on
p141
aVin their head as they were doing this.
p142
aVNow, this is Dr. Lene Harbott applying electrodes
p143
aVto the head of John Morton.
p144
aVJohn Morton is a former Can-Am and IMSA driver,
p145
aVwho's also a class champion at Le Mans.
p146
aVFantastic driver, and very willing to put up with graduate students
p147
aVand this sort of research.
p148
aVShe's putting electrodes on his head
p149
aVso that we can monitor the electrical activity
p150
aVin John's brain as he races around the track.
p151
aa(lp152
VNow, clearly we're not going to put a couple of electrodes on his head
p153
aVand understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track.
p154
aVHowever, neuroscientists have identified certain patterns
p155
aVthat let us tease out some very important aspects of this.
p156
aVFor instance, the resting brain
p157
aVtends to generate a lot of alpha waves.
p158
aVIn contrast, theta waves are associated with
p159
aVa lot of cognitive activity, like visual processing,
p160
aVthings where the driver is thinking quite a bit.
p161
aVNow, we can measure this,
p162
aVand we can look at the relative power
p163
aVbetween the theta waves and the alpha waves.
p164
aVThis gives us a measure of mental workload,
p165
aVhow much the driver is actually challenged cognitively
p166
aVat any point along the track.
p167
aa(lp168
VNow, we wanted to see if we could actually record this
p169
aVon the track, so we headed down south to Laguna Seca.
p170
aVLaguna Seca is a legendary raceway
p171
aVabout halfway between Salinas and Monterey.
p172
aVIt has a curve there called the Corkscrew.
p173
aVNow, the Corkscrew is a chicane, followed by a quick
p174
aVright-handed turn as the road drops three stories.
p175
aVNow, the strategy for driving this as explained to me was,
p176
aVyou aim for the bush in the distance,
p177
aVand as the road falls away, you realize it was actually the top of a tree.
p178
aa(lp179
VAll right, so thanks to the Revs Program at Stanford,
p180
aVwe were able to take John there
p181
aVand put him behind the wheel
p182
aVof a 1960 Porsche Abarth Carrera.
p183
aVLife is way too short for boring cars.
p184
aVSo, here you see John on the track,
p185
aVhe's going up the hill \u2014 Oh! Somebody liked that \u2014
p186
aVand you can see, actually, his mental workload
p187
aV\u2014 measuring here in the red bar \u2014
p188
aVyou can see his actions as he approaches.
p189
aVNow watch, he has to downshift.
p190
aVAnd then he has to turn left.
p191
aVLook for the tree, and down.
p192
aa(lp193
VNot surprisingly, you can see this is a pretty challenging task.
p194
aVYou can see his mental workload spike as he goes through this,
p195
aVas you would expect with something that requires
p196
aVthis level of complexity.
p197
aVBut what's really interesting is to look at areas of the track
p198
aVwhere his mental workload doesn't increase.
p199
aVI'm going to take you around now
p200
aVto the other side of the track.
p201
aVTurn three. And John's going to go into that corner
p202
aVand the rear end of the car is going to begin to slide out.
p203
aVHe's going to have to correct for that with steering.
p204
aVSo watch as John does this here.
p205
aVWatch the mental workload, and watch the steering.
p206
aVThe car begins to slide out, dramatic maneuver to correct it,
p207
aVand no change whatsoever in the mental workload.
p208
aVNot a challenging task.
p209
aVIn fact, entirely reflexive.
p210
aa(lp211
VNow, our data processing on this is still preliminary,
p212
aVbut it really seems that these phenomenal feats
p213
aVthat the race car drivers are performing
p214
aVare instinctive.
p215
aVThey are things that they have simply learned to do.
p216
aVIt requires very little mental workload
p217
aVfor them to perform these amazing feats.
p218
aVAnd their actions are fantastic.
p219
aVThis is exactly what you want to do on the steering wheel
p220
aVto catch the car in this situation.
p221
aa(lp222
VNow, this has given us tremendous insight
p223
aVand inspiration for our own autonomous vehicles.
p224
aVWe've started to ask the question:
p225
aVCan we make them a little less algorithmic
p226
aVand a little more intuitive?
p227
aVCan we take this reflexive action
p228
aVthat we see from the very best race car drivers,
p229
aVintroduce it to our cars,
p230
aVand maybe even into a system that could
p231
aVget onto your car in the future?
p232
aVThat would take us a long step
p233
aValong the road to autonomous vehicles
p234
aVthat drive as well as the best humans.
p235
aa(lp236
VBut it's made us think a little bit more deeply as well.
p237
aVDo we want something more from our car
p238
aVthan to simply be a chauffeur?
p239
aVDo we want our car to perhaps be a partner, a coach,
p240
aVsomeone that can use their understanding of the situation
p241
aVto help us reach our potential?
p242
aVCan, in fact, the technology not simply replace humans,
p243
aVbut allow us to reach the level of reflex and intuition
p244
aVthat we're all capable of?
p245
aa(lp246
VSo, as we move forward into this technological future,
p247
aVI want you to just pause and think of that for a moment.
p248
aVWhat is the ideal balance of human and machine?
p249
aVAnd as we think about that,
p250
aVlet's take inspiration
p251
aVfrom the absolutely amazing capabilities
p252
aVof the human body and the human mind.
p253
aa(lp254
VThank you.
p255

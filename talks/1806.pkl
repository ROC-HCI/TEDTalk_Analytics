VIn an age of global strife and climate change,
p5
aVI'm here to answer the all important question:
p6
aVWhy is sex so damn good?
p7
aVIf you're laughing, you know what I mean.
p8
aa(lp9
VNow, before we get to that answer,
p10
aVlet me tell you about Chris Hosmer.
p11
aVChris is a great friend of mine from my university days,
p12
aVbut secretly, I hate him.
p13
aa(lp14
VHere's why. Back in university, we had a quick project
p15
aVto design some solar-powered clocks.
p16
aVHere's my clock.
p17
aVIt uses something called the dwarf sunflower,
p18
aVwhich grows to about 12 inches in height.
p19
aVNow, as you know, sunflowers
p20
aVtrack the sun during the course of the day.
p21
aVSo in the morning, you see which direction the sunflower is facing,
p22
aVand you mark it on the blank area in the base.
p23
aVAt noon, you mark the changed position of the sunflower,
p24
aVand in the evening again, and that's your clock.
p25
aVNow, I know my clock doesn't tell you the exact time,
p26
aVbut it does give you a general idea using a flower.
p27
aVSo, in my completely unbiased, subjective opinion,
p28
aVit's brilliant.
p29
aa(lp30
VHowever, here's Chris's clock.
p31
aVIt's five magnifying glasses with a shot glass under each one.
p32
aVIn each shot glass is a different scented oil.
p33
aVIn the morning, the sunlight will shine down
p34
aVon the first magnifying glass,
p35
aVfocusing a beam of light on the shot glass underneath.
p36
aVThis will warm up the scented oil inside,
p37
aVand a particular smell will be emitted.
p38
aVA couple of hours later, the sun will shine
p39
aVon the next magnifying glass, and a different smell will be emitted.
p40
aVSo during the course of the day, five different smells
p41
aVare dispersed throughout that environment.
p42
aVAnyone living in that house can tell the time
p43
aVjust by the smell.
p44
aVYou can see why I hate Chris.
p45
aVI thought my idea was pretty good,
p46
aVbut his idea is genius,
p47
aVand at the time, I knew his idea was better than mine,
p48
aVbut I just couldn't explain why.
p49
aa(lp50
VOne thing you have to know about me is I hate to lose.
p51
aVThis problem's been bugging me for well over a decade.
p52
aVAll right, let's get back to the question of why sex is so good.
p53
aVMany years after the solar powered clocks project,
p54
aVa young lady I knew suggested maybe sex is so good
p55
aVbecause of the five senses.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd when she said this, I had an epiphany.
p58
aVSo I decided to evaluate different experiences I had in my life
p59
aVfrom the point of view of the five senses.
p60
aVTo do this, I devised something called the five senses graph.
p61
aVAlong the y-axis, you have a scale from zero to 10,
p62
aVand along the x-axis, you have, of course, the five senses.
p63
aVAnytime I had a memorable experience in my life,
p64
aVI would record it on this graph like a five senses diary.
p65
aVHere's a quick video to show you how it works.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Video) Jinsop Lee: Hey, my name's Jinsop,
p68
aVand today, I'm going to show you what riding motorbikes
p69
aVis like from the point of view of the five senses. Hey!
p70
aa(lp71
VBike designer: This is [unclear], custom bike designer.

p82
aa(lp83
V[Taste]
p84
aa(lp85
VJL: And that's how the five senses graph works.
p86
aa(lp87
VNow, for a period of three years, I gathered data,
p88
aVnot just me but also some of my friends,
p89
aVand I used to teach in university, so I forced my \u2014
p90
aVI mean, I asked my students to do this as well.
p91
aVSo here are some other results.
p92
aVThe first is for instant noodles.
p93
aVNow obviously, taste and smell are quite high,
p94
aVbut notice sound is at three.
p95
aVMany people told me a big part
p96
aVof the noodle-eating experience is the slurping noise.
p97
aVYou know. (Slurps)
p98
aVNeedless to say, I no longer dine with these people.
p99
aa(lp100
VOK, next, clubbing.
p101
aVOK, here what I found interesting was
p102
aVthat taste is at four, and many respondents told me
p103
aVit's because of the taste of drinks,
p104
aVbut also, in some cases, kissing is a big part of the clubbing experience.
p105
aVThese people I still do hang out with.
p106
aa(lp107
VAll right, and smoking.
p108
aVHere I found touch is at [six], and one of the reasons
p109
aVis that smokers told me the sensation of holding a cigarette
p110
aVand bringing it up to your lips is a big part of the smoking experience,
p111
aVwhich shows, it's kind of scary to think
p112
aVhow well cigarettes are designed by the manufacturers.
p113
aa(lp114
VOK. Now, what would the perfect experience
p115
aVlook like on the five senses graph?
p116
aVIt would, of course, be a horizontal line along the top.
p117
aVNow you can see, not even as intense an experience
p118
aVas riding a motorbike comes close.
p119
aa(lp120
VIn fact, in the years that I gathered data,
p121
aVonly one experience came close to being the perfect one.
p122
aVThat is, of course, sex. Great sex.
p123
aVRespondents said that great sex
p124
aVhits all of the five senses at an extreme level.
p125
aa(lp126
VHere I'll quote one of my students who said,
p127
aV"Sex is so good, it's good even when it's bad."
p128
aa(lp129
VSo the five senses theory does help explain
p130
aVwhy sex is so good.
p131
aVNow in the middle of all this five senses work,
p132
aVI suddenly remembered the solar-powered clocks project
p133
aVfrom my youth.
p134
aVAnd I realized this theory also explains why Chris's clock
p135
aVis so much better than mine.
p136
aVYou see, my clock only focuses on sight,
p137
aVand a little bit of touch.
p138
aVHere's Chris's clock.
p139
aVIt's the first clock ever that uses smell to tell the time.
p140
aVIn fact, in terms of the five senses,
p141
aVChris's clock is a revolution.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd that's what this theory taught me about my field.
p144
aVYou see, up till now, us designers,
p145
aVwe've mainly focused on making things look very pretty,
p146
aVand a little bit of touch,
p147
aVwhich means we've ignored the other three senses.
p148
aVChris's clock shows us that even raising just one
p149
aVof those other senses can make for a brilliant product.
p150
aVSo what if we started using the five senses theory
p151
aVin all of our designs?
p152
aa(lp153
VHere's three quick ideas I came up with.
p154
aVThis is an iron, you know, for your clothes,
p155
aVto which I added a spraying mechanism,
p156
aVso you fill up the vial with your favorite scent,
p157
aVand your clothes will smell nicer,
p158
aVbut hopefully it should also make
p159
aVthe ironing experience more enjoyable.
p160
aVWe could call this "the perfumator."
p161
aa(lp162
VAll right, next.
p163
aVSo I brush my teeth twice a day,
p164
aVand what if we had a toothbrush
p165
aVthat tastes like candy,
p166
aVand when the taste of candy ran out,
p167
aVyou'd know it's time to change your toothbrush?
p168
aa(lp169
VFinally, I have a thing for the keys on a flute or a clarinet.
p170
aVIt's not just the way they look, but I love the way they feel
p171
aVwhen you press down on them.
p172
aVNow, I don't play the flute or the clarinet,
p173
aVso I decided to combine these keys with an instrument I do play:
p174
aVthe television remote control.
p175
aa(lp176
VNow, when we look at these three ideas together,
p177
aVyou'll notice that the five senses theory
p178
aVdoesn't only change the way we use these products
p179
aVbut also the way they look.
p180
aVSo in conclusion, I've found the five senses theory
p181
aVto be a very useful tool in evaluating
p182
aVdifferent experiences in my life,
p183
aVand then taking those best experiences
p184
aVand hopefully incorporating them into my designs.
p185
aa(lp186
VNow, I realize the five senses isn't the only thing
p187
aVthat makes life interesting.
p188
aVThere's also the six emotions
p189
aVand that elusive x-factor.
p190
aVMaybe that could be the topic of my next talk.
p191
aa(lp192
VUntil then, please have fun
p193
aVusing the five senses in your own lives
p194
aVand your own designs.
p195
aa(lp196
VOh, one last thing before I leave.
p197
aVHere's the experience you all had while listening
p198
aVto the TED Talks.
p199
aVHowever, it would be better if we could boost up
p200
aVa couple of the other senses like smell and taste.
p201
aVAnd the best way to do that is with
p202
aVfree candy.
p203
aVYou guys ready?
p204
aVAll right.

And we&#39;ll let him take it from here:<br /><br />&quot;My design background began when I was 5 years old. My mother cruelly refused to buy me a Star Wars X-wing fighter, so I built my own from Lego. Yes, I was the traumatized little boy in the corner of the playground holding the multi-coloured Lego X-wing fighter. However, this did teach me an important lesson: You don&#39;t have to follow the instructions that come with the box. <br /><br />As an adult, I started my career as a suit-wearing design consultant, designing stuff and strategies for large companies. I then spent a mandatory two years in the Korean Army without killing anybody. Then I began teaching English, which eventually led to a job as an associate professor of industrial design. Being a professor means you&#39;re designing the most important thing of all: students and the type of designers they will later become.<br /><br />&quot;Now I am working on a series of short videos about industrial design. Each video follows a simple formula: the viewer must learn something new about design while laughing (or snickering) an average of two times per minute.

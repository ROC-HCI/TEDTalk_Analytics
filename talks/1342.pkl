VAs the highest military commander of the Netherlands,
p5
aVwith troops stationed around the world,
p6
aVI'm really honored to be here today.
p7
aa(lp8
VWhen I look around this TEDxAmsterdam venue,
p9
aVI see a very special audience.
p10
aVYou are the reason why I said yes
p11
aVto the invitation to come here today.
p12
aVWhen I look around, I see people who want to make a contribution.
p13
aVI see people who want to make a better world,
p14
aVby doing groundbreaking scientific work,
p15
aVby creating impressive works of art,
p16
aVby writing critical articles or inspiring books,
p17
aVby starting up sustainable businesses.
p18
aVAnd you all have chosen your own instruments
p19
aVto fulfill this mission of creating a better world.
p20
aVSome chose the microscope as their instrument.
p21
aVOthers chose dancing or painting,
p22
aVor making music like we just heard.
p23
aVSome chose the pen.
p24
aVOthers work through the instrument of money.
p25
aa(lp26
VLadies and gentlemen, I made a different choice.
p27
aa(lp28
VThanks.
p29
aa(lp30
VLadies and gentlemen ...
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
V(Applause)
p35
aa(lp36
VI share your goals.
p37
aVI share the goals of the speakers you heard before.
p38
aVI did not choose to take up the pen,
p39
aVthe brush,
p40
aVthe camera.
p41
aVI chose this instrument.
p42
aVI chose the gun.
p43
aa(lp44
VFor you, and you heard already,
p45
aVbeing so close to this gun may make you feel uneasy.
p46
aVIt may even feel scary.
p47
aVA real gun at a few feet's distance.
p48
aVLet us stop for a moment and feel this uneasiness.
p49
aVYou could even hear it.
p50
aVLet us cherish the fact
p51
aVthat probably most of you have never been close to a gun.
p52
aVIt means the Netherlands is a peaceful country.
p53
aVThe Netherlands is not at war.
p54
aVIt means soldiers are not needed to patrol our streets.
p55
aVGuns are not a part of our lives.
p56
aVIn many countries, it is a different story.
p57
aVIn many countries, people are confronted with guns.
p58
aVThey are oppressed.
p59
aVThey are intimidated \u2014
p60
aVby warlords,
p61
aVby terrorists,
p62
aVby criminals.
p63
aVWeapons can do a lot of harm.
p64
aVThey are the cause of much distress.
p65
aa(lp66
VWhy then am I standing before you with this weapon?
p67
aVWhy did I choose the gun as my instrument?
p68
aVToday I want to tell you why.
p69
aVToday I want to tell you
p70
aVwhy I chose the gun to create a better world.
p71
aVAnd I want to tell you how this gun can help.
p72
aa(lp73
VMy story starts in the city of Nijmegen
p74
aVin the east of the Netherlands,
p75
aVthe city where I was born.
p76
aVMy father was a hardworking baker,
p77
aVbut when he had finished work in the bakery,
p78
aVhe often told me and my brother stories.
p79
aVAnd most of the time,
p80
aVhe told me this story I'm going to share with you now.
p81
aVThe story of what happened
p82
aVwhen he was a conscripted soldier in the Dutch armed forces
p83
aVat the beginning of the Second World War.
p84
aVThe Nazis invaded the Netherlands.
p85
aVTheir grim plans were evident.
p86
aVThey meant to rule by means of repression.
p87
aVDiplomacy had failed to stop the Germans.
p88
aVOnly brute force remained.
p89
aVIt was our last resort.
p90
aVMy father was there to provide it.
p91
aa(lp92
VAs the son of a farmer who knew how to hunt,
p93
aVmy father was an excellent marksman.
p94
aVWhen he aimed, he never missed.
p95
aVAt this decisive moment in Dutch history
p96
aVmy father was positioned on the bank of the river Waal
p97
aVnear the city of Nijmegen.
p98
aVHe had a clear shot at the German soldiers who came to occupy a free country,
p99
aVhis country,
p100
aVour country.
p101
aVHe fired. Nothing happened.
p102
aVHe fired again.
p103
aVNo German soldier fell to the ground.
p104
aVMy father had been given an old gun
p105
aVthat could not even reach the opposite riverbank.
p106
aVHitler's troops marched on,
p107
aVand there was nothing my father could do about it.
p108
aa(lp109
VUntil the day my father died,
p110
aVhe was frustrated about missing these shots.
p111
aVHe could have done something.
p112
aVBut with an old gun,
p113
aVnot even the best marksman in the armed forces
p114
aVcould have hit the mark.
p115
aVSo this story stayed with me.
p116
aa(lp117
VThen in high school,
p118
aVI was gripped by the stories of the Allied soldiers \u2014
p119
aVsoldiers who left the safety of their own homes and risked their lives
p120
aVto liberate a country
p121
aVand a people that they didn't know.
p122
aVThey liberated my birth town.
p123
aVIt was then that I decided I would take up the gun \u2014
p124
aVout of respect and gratitude for those men and women
p125
aVwho came to liberate us.
p126
aVFrom the awareness that sometimes only the gun
p127
aVcan stand between good and evil.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd that is why I took up the gun \u2014
p130
aVnot to shoot,
p131
aVnot to kill,
p132
aVnot to destroy,
p133
aVbut to stop those who would do evil,
p134
aVto protect the vulnerable,
p135
aVto defend democratic values,
p136
aVto stand up for the freedom we have to talk here today in Amsterdam
p137
aVabout how we can make the world a better place.
p138
aa(lp139
VLadies and gentlemen,
p140
aVI do not stand here today to tell you about the glory of weapons.
p141
aVI do not like guns.
p142
aVAnd once you have been under fire yourself,
p143
aVit brings home even more clearly
p144
aVthat a gun is not some macho instrument to brag about.
p145
aVI stand here today
p146
aVto tell you about the use of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability.
p147
aVThe gun may be one of the most important instruments of peace and stability
p148
aVthat we have in this world.
p149
aa(lp150
VNow this may sound contradictory to you.
p151
aVBut not only have I seen with my own eyes
p152
aVduring my deployments in Lebanon, Sarajevo
p153
aVand as the Netherlands' Chief of Defence,
p154
aVthis is also supported by cold, hard statistics.
p155
aVViolence has declined dramatically over the last 500 years.
p156
aVDespite the pictures we are shown daily in the news,
p157
aVwars between developed countries are no longer commonplace.
p158
aVThe murder rate in Europe
p159
aVhas dropped by a factor of 30 since the Middle Ages.
p160
aVAnd occurrences of civil war and repression
p161
aVhave declined since the end of the Cold War.
p162
aVStatistics show that we are living in a relatively peaceful era.
p163
aa(lp164
VWhy?
p165
aVWhy has violence decreased?
p166
aVHas the human mind changed?
p167
aVWell, we were talking about the human mind this morning.
p168
aVDid we simply lose our beastly impulses for revenge,
p169
aVfor violent rituals,
p170
aVfor pure rage?
p171
aVOr is there something else?
p172
aVIn his latest book, Harvard professor Steven Pinker \u2014
p173
aVand many other thinkers before him \u2014
p174
aVconcludes that one of the main drivers
p175
aVbehind less violent societies
p176
aVis the spread of the constitutional state
p177
aVand the introduction, on a large scale,
p178
aVof the state monopoly on the legitimized use of violence \u2014
p179
aVlegitimized by a democratically elected government,
p180
aVlegitimized by checks and balances and an independent judicial system.
p181
aVIn other words, a state monopoly
p182
aVthat has the use of violence well under control.
p183
aa(lp184
VSuch a state monopoly on violence, first of all, serves as a reassurance.
p185
aVIt removes the incentive for an arms race
p186
aVbetween potentially hostile groups in our societies.
p187
aVSecondly, the presence of penalties
p188
aVthat outweigh the benefits of using violence
p189
aVtips the balance even further.
p190
aVAbstaining from violence
p191
aVbecomes more profitable than starting a war.
p192
aVNow nonviolence starts to work like a flywheel.
p193
aVIt enhances peace even further.
p194
aVWhere there is no conflict, trade flourishes.
p195
aVAnd trade is another important incentive against violence.
p196
aVWith trade, there's mutual interdependency and mutual gain between parties.
p197
aVAnd when there is mutual gain, both sides stand to lose more
p198
aVthan they would gain if they started a war.
p199
aVWar is simply no longer the best option,
p200
aVand that is why violence has decreased.
p201
aa(lp202
VThis, ladies and gentlemen,
p203
aVis the rationale behind the existence of my armed forces.
p204
aVThe armed forces implement the state monopoly on violence.
p205
aVWe do this in a legitimized way
p206
aVonly after our democracy has asked us to do so.
p207
aVIt is this legitimate, controlled use of the gun
p208
aVthat has contributed greatly
p209
aVto reducing the statistics of war, conflict and violence around the globe.
p210
aVIt is this participation in peacekeeping missions
p211
aVthat has led to the resolution of many civil wars.
p212
aVMy soldiers use the gun as an instrument of peace.
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd this is exactly why failed states are so dangerous.
p215
aVFailed states have no legitimized, democratically controlled use of force.
p216
aVFailed states do not know of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability.
p217
aVThat is why failed states can drag down a whole region into chaos and conflict.
p218
aVThat is why spreading the concept of the constitutional state
p219
aVis such an important aspect of our foreign missions.
p220
aVThat is why we are trying to build a judicial system
p221
aVright now in Afghanistan.
p222
aVThat is why we train police officers, we train judges,
p223
aVwe train public prosecutors around the world.
p224
aVAnd that is why \u2014
p225
aVand in the Netherlands, we are very unique in that \u2014
p226
aVthat is why the Dutch constitution states
p227
aVthat one of the main tasks of the armed forces
p228
aVis to uphold and promote the international rule of law.
p229
aa(lp230
VLadies and gentlemen,
p231
aVlooking at this gun, we are confronted with the ugly side of the human mind.
p232
aVEvery day I hope that politicians, diplomats, development workers
p233
aVcan turn conflict into peace
p234
aVand threat
p235
aVinto hope.
p236
aVAnd I hope that one day armies can be disbanded
p237
aVand humans will find a way of living together
p238
aVwithout violence and oppression.
p239
aVBut until that day comes,
p240
aVwe will have to make ideals and human failure
p241
aVmeet somewhere in the middle.
p242
aVUntil that day comes, I stand for my father
p243
aVwho tried to shoot the Nazis with an old gun.
p244
aVI stand for my men and women who are prepared to risk their lives
p245
aVfor a less violent world for all of us.
p246
aVI stand for this soldier who suffered partial hearing loss
p247
aVand sustained permanent injuries to her leg,
p248
aVwhen she was hit by a rocket on a mission in Afghanistan.
p249
aa(lp250
VLadies and gentlemen,
p251
aVuntil the day comes when we can do away with the gun,
p252
aVI hope we all agree
p253
aVthat peace and stability do not come free of charge.
p254
aVIt takes hard work, often behind the scenes.
p255
aVIt takes good equipment and well-trained, dedicated soldiers.
p256
aVI hope you will support the efforts of our armed forces
p257
aVto train soldiers like this young captain
p258
aVand provide her with a good gun,
p259
aVinstead of the bad gun my father was given.
p260
aVI hope you will support our soldiers when they are out there,
p261
aVwhen they come home
p262
aVand when they are injured and need our care.
p263
aVThey put their lives on the line, for us, for you,
p264
aVand we cannot let them down.
p265
aa(lp266
VI hope you will respect my soldiers,
p267
aVthis soldier with this gun.
p268
aVBecause she wants a better world.
p269
aVBecause she makes an active contribution to a better world,
p270
aVjust like all of us here today.
p271
aa(lp272
VThank you very much.

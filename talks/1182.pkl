VThe Highline
p5
aVis an old, elevated rail line
p6
aVthat runs for a mile and a half right through Manhattan.
p7
aVAnd it was originally a freight line
p8
aVthat ran down 10th Ave.
p9
aVAnd it became known as "Death Avenue"
p10
aVbecause so many people were run over by the trains
p11
aVthat the railroad hired a guy on horseback to run in front,
p12
aVand he became known as the "West Side Cowboy."
p13
aVBut even with a cowboy,
p14
aVabout one person a month
p15
aVwas killed and run over.
p16
aVSo they elevated it.
p17
aVThey built it 30 ft. in the air, right through the middle of the city.
p18
aVBut with the rise of interstate trucking,
p19
aVit was used less and less.
p20
aVAnd by 1980, the last train rode.
p21
aVIt was a train loaded with frozen turkeys \u2014 they say, at Thanksgiving \u2014
p22
aVfrom the meatpacking district.
p23
aVAnd then it was abandoned.
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd I live in the neighborhood,
p26
aVand I first read about it in the New York Times,
p27
aVin an article that said it was going to be demolished.
p28
aVAnd I assumed someone was working
p29
aVto preserve it or save it
p30
aVand I could volunteer,
p31
aVbut I realized no one was doing anything.
p32
aVI went to my first community board meeting \u2014
p33
aVwhich I'd never been to one before \u2014
p34
aVand sat next to another guy named Joshua David,
p35
aVwho's a travel writer.
p36
aVAnd at the end of the meeting, we realized
p37
aVwe were the only two people that were sort of interested in the project;
p38
aVmost people wanted to tear it down.
p39
aVSo we exchanged business cards,
p40
aVand we kept calling each other
p41
aVand decided to start this organization,
p42
aVFriends of the High Line.
p43
aVAnd the goal at first
p44
aVwas just saving it from demolition,
p45
aVbut then we also wanted to figure out what we could do with it.
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd what first attracted me, or interested me,
p48
aVwas this view from the street \u2014
p49
aVwhich is this steel structure,
p50
aVsort of rusty,
p51
aVthis industrial relic.
p52
aVBut when I went up on top,
p53
aVit was a mile and a half of wildflowers
p54
aVrunning right through the middle of Manhattan
p55
aVwith views of the Empire State Building
p56
aVand the Statue of Liberty and the Hudson River.
p57
aVAnd that's really where we started,
p58
aVthe idea coalesced around, let's make this a park,
p59
aVand let's have it be sort of inspired
p60
aVby this wildscape.
p61
aa(lp62
VAt the time, there was a lot of opposition.
p63
aVMayor Giuliani wanted to tear it down.
p64
aVI'm going to fast-forward through a lot of lawsuits
p65
aVand a lot of community engagement.
p66
aVMayor Bloomberg came in office, he was very supportive,
p67
aVbut we still had to make the economic case.
p68
aVThis was after 9/11;
p69
aVthe city was in tough times.
p70
aVSo we commissioned an economic feasibility study
p71
aVto try to make the case.
p72
aVAnd it turns out, we got those numbers wrong.
p73
aVWe thought it would cost 100 million dollars to build.
p74
aVSo far it's cost about 150 million.
p75
aVAnd the main case was,
p76
aVthis is going to make good economic sense for the city.
p77
aVSo we said over a 20-year time period,
p78
aVthe value to the city in increased property values
p79
aVand increased taxes
p80
aVwould be about 250 million.
p81
aVThat was enough. It really got the city behind it.
p82
aVIt turns out we were wrong on that.
p83
aVNow people estimate it's created about a half a billion dollars,
p84
aVor will create about a half a billion dollars,
p85
aVin tax revenues for the city.
p86
aVWe did a design competition,
p87
aVselected a design team.
p88
aVWe worked with them to really create a design
p89
aVthat was inspired by that wildscape.
p90
aVThere's three sections.
p91
aa(lp92
VWe opened the fist section in 2009.
p93
aVIt's been successful beyond our dreams.
p94
aVLast year we had about two million people,
p95
aVwhich is about 10 times what we ever estimated.
p96
aVThis is one of my favorite features in section one.
p97
aVIt's this amphitheater right over 10th Ave.
p98
aVAnd the first section ends at 20th St. right now.
p99
aVThe other thing, it's generated, obviously, a lot of economic value;
p100
aVit's also inspired, I think, a lot of great architecture.
p101
aVThere's a point, you can stand here
p102
aVand see buildings by Frank Gehry,
p103
aVJean Nouvel, Shigeru Ban,
p104
aVNeil Denari.
p105
aVAnd the Whitney is moving downtown
p106
aVand is building their new museum right at the base of the High Line.
p107
aVAnd this has been designed by Renzo Piano.
p108
aVAnd they're going to break ground in May.
p109
aa(lp110
VAnd we've already started construction on section two.
p111
aVThis is one of my favorite features,
p112
aVthis flyover where you're eight feet
p113
aVoff the surface of the High Line,
p114
aVrunning through a canopy of trees.
p115
aVThe High Line used to be covered in billboards,
p116
aVand so we've taken a playful take
p117
aVwhere, instead of framing advertisements,
p118
aVit's going to frame people in views of the city.
p119
aVThis was just installed last month.
p120
aVAnd then the last section was going to go around the rail yards,
p121
aVwhich is the largest undeveloped site
p122
aVin Manhattan.
p123
aVAnd the city has planned \u2014 for better or for worse \u2014
p124
aV12 million square-feet of development
p125
aVthat the High Line is going to ring around.
p126
aa(lp127
VBut what really, I think, makes the High Line special
p128
aVis the people.
p129
aVAnd honestly, even though I love the designs that we were building,
p130
aVI was always frightened that I wouldn't really love it,
p131
aVbecause I fell in love with that wildscape \u2014
p132
aVand how could you recreate that magic?
p133
aVBut what I found
p134
aVis it's in the people and how they use it
p135
aVthat, to me, makes it so special.
p136
aVJust one quick example
p137
aVis I realized right after we opened
p138
aVthat there were all these people holding hands on the High Line.
p139
aVAnd I realized New Yorkers don't hold hands;
p140
aVwe just don't do that outside.
p141
aVBut you see that happening on the High Line,
p142
aVand I think that's the power
p143
aVthat public space can have
p144
aVto transform how people experience their city
p145
aVand interact with each other.
p146
aa(lp147
VThanks.

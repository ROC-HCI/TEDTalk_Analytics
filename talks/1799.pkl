VThis is an ambucycle.
p5
aVThis is the fastest way to reach any medical emergency.
p6
aVIt has everything an ambulance has except for a bed.
p7
aVYou see the defibrillator. You see the equipment.
p8
aVWe all saw the tragedy that happened in Boston.
p9
aVWhen I was looking at these pictures,
p10
aVit brought me back many years to my past
p11
aVwhen I was a child.
p12
aVI grew up in a small neighborhood in Jerusalem.
p13
aVWhen I was six years old, I was walking back from school
p14
aVon a Friday afternoon with my older brother.
p15
aVWe were passing by a bus stop.
p16
aVWe saw a bus blow up in front of our eyes.
p17
aVThe bus was on fire, and many people were hurt and killed.
p18
aVI remembered an old man
p19
aVyelling to us and crying to help us get him up.
p20
aVHe just needed someone helping him.
p21
aVWe were so scared and we just ran away.
p22
aVGrowing up, I decided I wanted to become a doctor and save lives.
p23
aVMaybe that was because of what I saw when I was a child.
p24
aVWhen I was 15, I took an EMT course,
p25
aVand I went to volunteer on an ambulance.
p26
aVFor two years, I volunteered on an ambulance in Jerusalem.
p27
aVI helped many people,
p28
aVbut whenever someone really needed help,
p29
aVI never got there in time. We never got there.
p30
aVThe traffic is so bad. The distance, and everything.
p31
aVWe never got there when somebody really needed us.
p32
aVOne day, we received a call about a seven-year-old child
p33
aVchoking from a hot dog.
p34
aVTraffic was horrific, and we were coming from
p35
aVthe other side of town in the north part of Jerusalem.
p36
aVWhen we got there, 20 minutes later,
p37
aVwe started CPR on the kid.
p38
aVA doctor comes in from a block away,
p39
aVstop us, checks the kid, and tells us to stop CPR.
p40
aVThat second he declared this child dead.
p41
aVAt that moment, I understood
p42
aVthat this child died for nothing.
p43
aVIf this doctor, who lived one block away from there,
p44
aVwould have come 20 minutes earlier,
p45
aVnot have to wait until that siren he heard before
p46
aVcoming from the ambulance,
p47
aVif he would have heard about it way before,
p48
aVhe would have saved this child.
p49
aVHe could have run from a block away.
p50
aVHe could have saved this child.
p51
aVI said to myself, there must be a better way.
p52
aVTogether with 15 of my friends \u2014
p53
aVwe were all EMTs \u2014
p54
aVwe decided, let's protect our neighborhood,
p55
aVso when something like that happens again,
p56
aVwe will be there running to the scene a lot before the ambulance.
p57
aVSo I went over to the manager of the ambulance company
p58
aVand I told him, "Please, whenever you have a call
p59
aVcoming into our neighborhood,
p60
aVwe have 15 great guys who are willing
p61
aVto stop everything they're doing and run and save lives.
p62
aVJust alert us by beeper.
p63
aVWe'll buy these beepers, just tell your dispatch
p64
aVto send us the beeper, and we will run and save lives."
p65
aVWell, he was laughing. I was 17 years old. I was a kid.
p66
aVAnd he said to me \u2014 I remember this like yesterday \u2014
p67
aVhe was a great guy, but he said to me,
p68
aV"Kid, go to school, or go open a falafel stand.
p69
aVWe're not really interested in these kinds of new adventures.
p70
aVWe're not interested in your help." And he threw me out of the room.
p71
aV"I don't need your help," he said.
p72
aVI was a very stubborn kid.
p73
aVAs you see now, I'm walking around like crazy, meshugenah.
p74
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p75
aVSo I decided to use the Israeli very famous technique
p76
aVyou've probably all heard of, chutzpah. (Laughter)
p77
aVAnd the next day, I went and I bought two police scanners,
p78
aVand I said, "The hell with you, if you don't want
p79
aVto give me information, I'll get the information myself."
p80
aVAnd we did turns, who's going to listen to the radio scanners.
p81
aVThe next day, while I was listening to the scanners,
p82
aVI heard about a call coming in of a 70-year-old man
p83
aVhurt by a car only one block away from me
p84
aVon the main street of my neighborhood.
p85
aVI ran there by foot. I had no medical equipment.
p86
aVWhen I got there, the 70-year-old man
p87
aVwas lying on the floor, blood was gushing out of his neck.
p88
aVHe was on Coumadin.
p89
aVI knew I had to stop his bleeding or else he would die.
p90
aVI took off my yarmulke, because I had no medical equipment,
p91
aVand with a lot of pressure, I stopped his bleeding.
p92
aVHe was bleeding from his neck.
p93
aVWhen the ambulance arrived 15 minutes later,
p94
aVI gave them over a patient who was alive.
p95
aV(Applause)
p96
aVWhen I went to visit him two days later,
p97
aVhe gave me a hug and was crying
p98
aVand thanking me for saving his life.
p99
aVAt that moment, when I realized this is the first person
p100
aVI ever saved in my life after two years volunteering in an ambulance,
p101
aVI knew this is my life's mission.
p102
aVSo today, 22 years later, we have United Hatzalah.
p103
aV(Applause)
p104
aV"Hatzalah" means "rescue," for all of you who don't know Hebrew.
p105
aVI forgot I'm not in Israel.
p106
aVSo we have thousands of volunteers
p107
aVwho are passionate about saving lives,
p108
aVand they're spread all around, so whenever a call comes in,
p109
aVthey just stop everything and go and run and save a life.
p110
aVOur average response time today
p111
aVwent down to less than three minutes in Israel.
p112
aV(Applause)
p113
aVI'm talking about heart attacks,
p114
aVI'm talking about car accidents,
p115
aVGod forbid bomb attacks, shootings, whatever it is,
p116
aVeven a woman 3 o'clock in the morning
p117
aVfalling in her home and needs someone to help her.
p118
aVThree minutes, we'll have a guy with his pajamas
p119
aVrunning to her house and helping her get up.
p120
aVThe reasons why we're so successful are because of three things.
p121
aVThousands of passionate volunteers
p122
aVwho will leave everything they do
p123
aVand run to help people they don't even know.
p124
aVWe're not there to replace ambulances.
p125
aVWe're just there
p126
aVto get the gap between the ambulance call until they arrive.
p127
aVAnd we save people that otherwise would not be saved.
p128
aVThe second reason is because of our technology.
p129
aVYou know, Israelis are good in technology.
p130
aVEvery one of us has on his phone, no matter what kind of phone,
p131
aVa GPS technology done by NowForce,
p132
aVand whenever a call comes in,
p133
aVthe closest five volunteers get the call,
p134
aVand they actually get there really quick,
p135
aVand navigated by a traffic navigator to get there and not waste time.
p136
aVAnd this is a great technology we use all over the country
p137
aVand reduce the response time.
p138
aVAnd the third thing are these ambucycles.
p139
aVThese ambucycles are an ambulance on two wheels.
p140
aVWe don't transfer people, but we stabilize them,
p141
aVand we save their lives.
p142
aVThey never get stuck in traffic. They could even go on a sidewalk.
p143
aVThey never, literally, get stuck in traffic.
p144
aVThat's why we get there so fast.
p145
aVA few years after I started this organization,
p146
aVin a Jewish community,
p147
aVtwo Muslims from east Jerusalem called me up.
p148
aVThey ask me to meet. They wanted to meet with me.
p149
aVMuhammad Asli and Murad Alyan.
p150
aVWhen Muhammad told me his personal story,
p151
aVhow his father, 55 years old, collapsed at home,
p152
aVhad a cardiac arrest,
p153
aVand it took over an hour for an ambulance arrive,
p154
aVand he saw his father die in front of his eyes,
p155
aVhe asked me, "Please start this in east Jerusalem."
p156
aVI said to myself, I saw so much tragedy, so much hate,
p157
aVand it's not about saving Jews. It's not about saving Muslims.
p158
aVIt's not about saving Christians. It's about saving people.
p159
aVSo I went ahead, full force \u2014
p160
aV(Applause) \u2014
p161
aVand I started United Hatzalah in east Jerusalem,
p162
aVand that's why the names United
p163
aVand Hatzalah match so well.
p164
aVWe started hand in hand saving Jews and Arabs.
p165
aVArabs were saving Jews. Jews were saving Arabs.
p166
aVSomething special happened.
p167
aVArabs and Jews, they don't always get along together,
p168
aVbut here in this situation,
p169
aVthe communities, literally,
p170
aVit's an unbelievable situation that happened,
p171
aVthe diversities, all of a sudden they had a common interest:
p172
aVLet's save lives together.
p173
aVSettlers were saving Arabs and Arabs were saving settlers.
p174
aVIt's an unbelievable concept that could work
p175
aVonly when you have such a great cause.
p176
aVAnd these are all volunteers.
p177
aVNo one is getting money.
p178
aVThey're all doing it for the purpose of saving lives.
p179
aVWhen my own father collapsed a few years ago
p180
aVfrom a cardiac arrest, one of the first volunteers
p181
aVto arrive to save my father
p182
aVwas one of these Muslim volunteers from east Jerusalem
p183
aVwho was in the first course to join Hatzalah.
p184
aVAnd he saved my father.
p185
aVCould you imagine how I felt in that moment?
p186
aVWhen I started this organization, I was 17 years old.
p187
aVI never imagined that one day I'd be speaking at TEDMED.
p188
aVI never even knew what TEDMED was then.
p189
aVI don't think it existed, but I never imagined,
p190
aVI never imagined that it's going to go all around,
p191
aVit's going to spread around,
p192
aVand this last year we started in Panama and Brazil.
p193
aVAll I need is a partner who is a little meshugenah like me,
p194
aVpassionate about saving lives, and willing to do it.
p195
aVAnd I'm actually starting it in India very soon
p196
aVwith a friend who I met in Harvard just a while back.
p197
aVHatzalah actually started in Brooklyn by a Hasidic Jew
p198
aVyears before us in Williamsburg,
p199
aVand now it's all over the Jewish community in New York,
p200
aVeven Australia and Mexico and many other Jewish communities.
p201
aVBut it could spread everywhere.
p202
aVIt's very easy to adopt.
p203
aVYou even saw these volunteers in New York
p204
aVsaving lives in the World Trade Center.
p205
aVLast year alone, we treated in Israel 207,000 people.
p206
aVForty-two thousand of them were life-threatening situations.
p207
aVAnd we made a difference.
p208
aVI guess you could call this a lifesaving flash mob,
p209
aVand it works.
p210
aVWhen I look all around here,
p211
aVI see lots of people who would go an extra mile,
p212
aVrun an extra mile to save other people,
p213
aVno matter who they are, no matter what religion,
p214
aVno matter who, where they come from.
p215
aVWe all want to be heroes.
p216
aVWe just need a good idea, motivation
p217
aVand lots of chutzpah,
p218
aVand we could save millions of people
p219
aVthat otherwise would not be saved.
p220
aVThank you very much.
p221
aV(Applause)

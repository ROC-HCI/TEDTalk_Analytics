VIs there anything unique about human beings?
p5
aVThere is.
p6
aVWe're the only creatures
p7
aVwith fully developed moral sentiments.
p8
aVWe're obsessed with morality as social creatures.
p9
aVWe need to know why people are doing what they're doing.
p10
aVAnd I personally am obsessed with morality.
p11
aVIt was all due to this woman,
p12
aVSister Mary Marastela,
p13
aValso known as my mom.
p14
aVAs an altar boy, I breathed in a lot of incense,
p15
aVand I learned to say phrases in Latin,
p16
aVbut I also had time to think
p17
aVabout whether my mother's top-down morality
p18
aVapplied to everybody.
p19
aVI saw that people who were religious and non-religious
p20
aVwere equally obsessed with morality.
p21
aVI thought, maybe there's some earthly basis
p22
aVfor moral decisions.
p23
aVBut I wanted to go further
p24
aVthan to say our brains make us moral.
p25
aVI want to know if there's a chemistry of morality.
p26
aVI want to know
p27
aVif there was a moral molecule.
p28
aa(lp29
VAfter 10 years of experiments,
p30
aVI found it.
p31
aVWould you like to see it? I brought some with me.
p32
aVThis little syringe
p33
aVcontains the moral molecule.
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aVIt's called oxytocin.
p36
aVSo oxytocin is a simple and ancient molecule
p37
aVfound only in mammals.
p38
aVIn rodents, it was known
p39
aVto make mothers care for their offspring,
p40
aVand in some creatures,
p41
aVallowed for toleration of burrowmates.
p42
aVBut in humans, it was only known
p43
aVto facilitate birth and breastfeeding in women,
p44
aVand is released by both sexes during sex.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo I had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral molecule.
p47
aVI did what most of us do \u2014 I tried it on some colleagues.
p48
aVOne of them told me,
p49
aV"Paul, that is the world's stupidist idea.
p50
aVIt is," he said, "only a female molecule.
p51
aVIt can't be that important."
p52
aVBut I countered, "Well men's brains make this too.
p53
aVThere must be a reason why."
p54
aVBut he was right, it was a stupid idea.
p55
aVBut it was testably stupid.
p56
aVIn other words, I thought I could design an experiment
p57
aVto see if oxytocin made people moral.
p58
aa(lp59
VTurns out it wasn't so easy.
p60
aVFirst of all, oxytocin is a shy molecule.
p61
aVBaseline levels are near zero,
p62
aVwithout some stimulus to cause its release.
p63
aVAnd when it's produced, it has a three-minute half-life,
p64
aVand degrades rapidly at room temperature.
p65
aVSo this experiment would have to cause a surge of oxytocin,
p66
aVhave to grab it fast and keep it cold.
p67
aVI think I can do that.
p68
aVNow luckily, oxytocin is produced
p69
aVboth in the brain and in the blood,
p70
aVso I could do this experiment without learning neurosurgery.
p71
aVThen I had to measure morality.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo taking on Morality with a capital M is a huge project.
p74
aVSo I started smaller.
p75
aVI studied one single virtue:
p76
aVtrustworthiness.
p77
aVWhy? I had shown in the early 2000s
p78
aVthat countries with a higher proportion of trustworthy people
p79
aVare more prosperous.
p80
aVSo in these countries, more economic transactions occur
p81
aVand more wealth is created,
p82
aValleviating poverty.
p83
aVSo poor countries are by and large low trust countries.
p84
aVSo if I understood the chemistry of trustworthiness,
p85
aVI might help alleviate poverty.
p86
aa(lp87
VBut I'm also a skeptic.
p88
aVI don't want to just ask people, "Are you trustworthy?"
p89
aVSo instead I use
p90
aVthe Jerry Maguire approach to research.
p91
aVIf you're so virtuous,
p92
aVshow me the money.
p93
aVSo what we do in my lab
p94
aVis we tempt people with virtue and vice by using money.
p95
aVLet me show you how we do that.
p96
aVSo we recruit some people for an experiment.
p97
aVThey all get $10 if they agree to show up.
p98
aVWe give them lots of instruction, and we never ever deceive them.
p99
aVThen we match them in pairs by computer.
p100
aVAnd in that pair, one person gets a message saying,
p101
aV"Do you want to give up some of your $10
p102
aVyou earned for being here
p103
aVand ship it to someone else in the lab?"
p104
aVThe trick is you can't see them,
p105
aVyou can't talk to them.
p106
aVYou only do it one time.
p107
aVNow whatever you give up
p108
aVgets tripled in the other person's account.
p109
aVYou're going to make them a lot wealthier.
p110
aVAnd they get a message by computer saying
p111
aVperson one sent you this amount of money.
p112
aVDo you want to keep it all,
p113
aVor do you want to send some amount back?
p114
aa(lp115
VSo think about this experiment for minute.
p116
aVYou're going to sit on these hard chairs for an hour and a half.
p117
aVSome mad scientist is going to jab your arm with a needle
p118
aVand take four tubes of blood.
p119
aVAnd now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a stranger?
p120
aVSo this was the birth of vampire economics.
p121
aVMake a decision and give me some blood.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo in fact, experimental economists
p124
aVhad run this test around the world,
p125
aVand for much higher stakes,
p126
aVand the consensus view
p127
aVwas that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust,
p128
aVand the transfer from the second person back to the first
p129
aVmeasured trustworthiness.
p130
aVBut in fact, economists were flummoxed
p131
aVon why the second person would ever return any money.
p132
aVThey assumed money is good,
p133
aVwhy not keep it all?
p134
aa(lp135
VThat's not what we found.
p136
aVWe found 90 percent of the first decision-makers sent money,
p137
aVand of those who received money,
p138
aV95 percent returned some of it.
p139
aVBut why?
p140
aVWell by measuring oxytocin
p141
aVwe found that the more money the second person received,
p142
aVthe more their brain produced oxytocin,
p143
aVand the more oxytocin on board,
p144
aVthe more money they returned.
p145
aVSo we have a biology of trustworthiness.
p146
aa(lp147
VBut wait. What's wrong with this experiment?
p148
aVTwo things.
p149
aVOne is that nothing in the body happens in isolation.
p150
aVSo we measured nine other molecules that interact with oxytocin,
p151
aVbut they didn't have any effect.
p152
aVBut the second is
p153
aVthat I still only had this indirect relationship
p154
aVbetween oxytocin and trustworthiness.
p155
aVI didn't know for sure
p156
aVoxytocin caused trustworthiness.
p157
aVSo to make the experiment,
p158
aVI knew I'd have to go into the brain
p159
aVand manipulate oxytocin directly.
p160
aVI used everything short of a drill
p161
aVto get oxytocin into my own brain.
p162
aVAnd I found I could do it
p163
aVwith a nasal inhaler.
p164
aVSo along with colleagues in Zurich,
p165
aVwe put 200 men on oxytocin or placebo,
p166
aVhad that same trust test with money,
p167
aVand we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust,
p168
aVwe can more than double the number of people
p169
aVwho sent all their money to a stranger \u2014
p170
aVall without altering mood or cognition.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo oxytocin is the trust molecule,
p173
aVbut is it the moral molecule?
p174
aVUsing the oxytocin inhaler,
p175
aVwe ran more studies.
p176
aVWe showed that oxytocin infusion
p177
aVincreases generosity
p178
aVin unilateral monetary transfers
p179
aVby 80 percent.
p180
aVWe showed it increases donations to charity
p181
aVby 50 percent.
p182
aVWe've also investigated
p183
aVnon-pharmacologic ways to raise oxytocin.
p184
aVThese include massage,
p185
aVdancing and praying.
p186
aVYes, my mom was happy about that last one.
p187
aVAnd whenever we raise oxytocin,
p188
aVpeople willingly open up their wallets
p189
aVand share money with strangers.
p190
aa(lp191
VBut why do they do this?
p192
aVWhat does it feel like
p193
aVwhen your brain is flooded with oxytocin?
p194
aVTo investigate this question, we ran an experiment
p195
aVwhere we had people watch a video
p196
aVof a father and his four year-old son,
p197
aVand his son has terminal brain cancer.
p198
aVAfter they watched the video, we had them rate their feelings
p199
aVand took blood before and after to measure oxytocin.
p200
aVThe change in oxytocin
p201
aVpredicted their feelings of empathy.
p202
aVSo it's empathy
p203
aVthat makes us connect to other people.
p204
aVIt's empathy that makes us help other people.
p205
aVIt's empathy that makes us moral.
p206
aa(lp207
VNow this idea is not new.
p208
aVA then unknown philosopher named Adam Smith
p209
aVwrote a book in 1759
p210
aVcalled "The Theory of Moral Sentiments."
p211
aVIn this book, Smith argued
p212
aVthat we are moral creatures, not because of a top-down reason,
p213
aVbut for a bottom-up reason.
p214
aVHe said we're social creatures,
p215
aVso we share the emotions of others.
p216
aVSo if I do something that hurts you, I feel that pain.
p217
aVSo I tend to avoid that.
p218
aVIf I do something that makes you happy, I get to share your joy.
p219
aVSo I tend to do those things.
p220
aVNow this is the same Adam Smith who, 17 years later,
p221
aVwould write a little book called "The Wealth of Nations" \u2014
p222
aVthe founding document of economics.
p223
aVBut he was, in fact, a moral philosopher,
p224
aVand he was right on why we're moral.
p225
aVI just found the molecule behind it.
p226
aVBut knowing that molecule is valuable,
p227
aVbecause it tells us how to turn up this behavior
p228
aVand what turns it off.
p229
aVIn particular, it tells us
p230
aVwhy we see immorality.
p231
aa(lp232
VSo to investigate immorality,
p233
aVlet me bring you back now to 1980.
p234
aVI'm working at a gas station
p235
aVon the outskirts of Santa Barbara, California.
p236
aVYou sit in a gas station all day,
p237
aVyou see lots of morality and immorality, let me tell you.
p238
aVSo one Sunday afternoon, a man walks into my cashier's booth
p239
aVwith this beautiful jewelry box.
p240
aVOpens it up and there's a pearl necklace inside.
p241
aVAnd he said, "Hey, I was in the men's room.
p242
aVI just found this. What do you think we should do with it?"
p243
aV"I don't know, put it in the lost and found."
p244
aV"Well this is very valuable.
p245
aVWe have to find the owner for this." I said, "Yea."
p246
aa(lp247
VSo we're trying to decide what to do with this,
p248
aVand the phone rings.
p249
aVAnd a man says very excitedly,
p250
aV"I was in your gas station a while ago,
p251
aVand I bought this jewelry for my wife, and I can't find it."
p252
aVI said, "Pearl necklace?" "Yeah."
p253
aV"Hey, a guy just found it."
p254
aV"Oh, you're saving my life. Here's my phone number.
p255
aVTell that guy to wait half an hour.
p256
aVI'll be there and I'll give him a $200 reward."
p257
aVGreat, so I tell the guy, "Look, relax.
p258
aVGet yourself a fat reward. Life's good."
p259
aVHe said, "I can't do it.
p260
aVI have this job interview in Galena in 15 minutes,
p261
aVand I need this job, I've got to go."
p262
aVAgain he asked me, "What do you think we should do?"
p263
aVI'm in high school. I have no idea.
p264
aVSo I said, "I'll hold it for you."
p265
aVHe said, "You know, you've been so nice, let's split the reward."
p266
aVI'll give you the jewelry, you give me a hundred dollars,
p267
aVand when the guy comes ... "
p268
aa(lp269
VYou see it. I was conned.
p270
aVSo this is a classic con called the pigeon drop,
p271
aVand I was the pigeon.
p272
aVSo the way many cons work
p273
aVis not that the conman gets the victim to trust him,
p274
aVit's that he shows he trusts the victim.
p275
aVNow we know what happens.
p276
aVThe victim's brain releases oxytocin,
p277
aVand you're opening up your wallet or purse, giving away the money.
p278
aa(lp279
VSo who are these people
p280
aVwho manipulate our oxytocin systems?
p281
aVWe found, testing thousands of individuals,
p282
aVthat five percent of the population
p283
aVdon't release oxytocin on stimulus.
p284
aVSo if you trust them, their brains don't release oxytocin.
p285
aVIf there's money on the table, they keep it all.
p286
aVSo there's a technical word for these people in my lab.
p287
aVWe call them bastards.
p288
aV(Laughter)
p289
aVThese are not people you want to have a beer with.
p290
aVThey have many of the attributes of psychopaths.
p291
aa(lp292
VNow there are other ways the system can be inhibited.
p293
aVOne is through improper nurturing.
p294
aVSo we've studied sexually abused women,
p295
aVand about half those don't release oxytocin on stimulus.
p296
aVYou need enough nurturing
p297
aVfor this system to develop properly.
p298
aVAlso, high stress inhibits oxytocin.
p299
aVSo we all know this, when we're really stressed out,
p300
aVwe're not acting our best.
p301
aa(lp302
VThere's another way oxytocin is inhibited, which is interesting \u2014
p303
aVthrough the action of testosterone.
p304
aVSo we, in experiments, have administered testosterone to men.
p305
aVAnd instead of sharing money,
p306
aVthey become selfish.
p307
aVBut interestingly,
p308
aVhigh testosterone males are also more likely
p309
aVto use their own money to punish others for being selfish.
p310
aV(Laughter)
p311
aVNow think about this. It means, within our own biology,
p312
aVwe have the yin and yang of morality.
p313
aVWe have oxytocin that connects us to others,
p314
aVmakes us feel what they feel.
p315
aVAnd we have testosterone.
p316
aVAnd men have 10 times the testosterone as women,
p317
aVso men do this more than women \u2014
p318
aVwe have testosterone that makes us want to punish
p319
aVpeople who behave immorally.
p320
aVWe don't need God or government telling us what to do.
p321
aVIt's all inside of us.
p322
aa(lp323
VSo you may be wondering:
p324
aVthese are beautiful laboratory experiments,
p325
aVdo they really apply to real life?
p326
aVYeah, I've been worrying about that too.
p327
aVSo I've gone out of the lab
p328
aVto see if this really holds in our daily lives.
p329
aVSo last summer, I attended a wedding in Southern England.
p330
aV200 people in this beautiful Victorian mansion.
p331
aVI didn't know a single person.
p332
aVAnd I drove up in my rented Vauxhall.
p333
aVAnd I took out a centrifuge and dry ice
p334
aVand needles and tubes.
p335
aVAnd I took blood from the bride and the groom
p336
aVand the wedding party and the family and the friends
p337
aVbefore and immediately after the vows.
p338
aa(lp339
V(Laughter)
p340
aa(lp341
VAnd guess what?
p342
aVWeddings cause a release of oxytocin,
p343
aVbut they do so in a very particular way.
p344
aVWho is the center of the wedding solar system?
p345
aVThe bride.
p346
aVShe had the biggest increase in oxytocin.
p347
aVWho loves the wedding almost as much as the bride?
p348
aVHer mother, that's right.
p349
aVHer mother was number two.
p350
aVThen the groom's father, then the groom,
p351
aVthen the family, then the friends \u2014
p352
aVarrayed around the bride
p353
aVlike planets around the Sun.
p354
aVSo I think it tells us that we've designed this ritual
p355
aVto connect us to this new couple,
p356
aVconnect us emotionally.
p357
aVWhy? Because we need them to be successful at reproducing
p358
aVto perpetuate the species.
p359
aa(lp360
VI also worried that my trust experiments with small amounts of money
p361
aVdidn't really capture how often we actually trust our lives to strangers.
p362
aVSo even though I have a fear of heights,
p363
aVI recently strapped myself to another human being
p364
aVand stepped out of an airplane at 12,000 ft.
p365
aVI took my blood before and after,
p366
aVand I had a huge spike of oxytocin.
p367
aVAnd there are so many ways we can connect to people.
p368
aVFor example, through social media.
p369
aVMany people are Tweeting right now.
p370
aVSo we investigated the role of social media
p371
aVand found the using social media
p372
aVproduced a solid double-digit increase in oxytocin.
p373
aa(lp374
VSo I ran this experiment recently for the Korean Broadcasting System.
p375
aVAnd they had the reporters and their producers participate.
p376
aVAnd one of these guys, he must have been 22,
p377
aVhe had 150 percent spike in oxytocin.
p378
aVI mean, astounding; no one has this.
p379
aVSo he was using social media in private.
p380
aVWhen I wrote my report to the Koreans,
p381
aVI said, "Look, I don't know what this guy was doing,"
p382
aVbut my guess was interacting with his mother or his girlfriend.
p383
aVThey checked.
p384
aVHe was interacting on his girlfriend's Facebook page.
p385
aVThere you go. That's connection.
p386
aVSo there's tons of ways that we can connect to other people,
p387
aVand it seems to be universal.
p388
aa(lp389
VTwo weeks ago,
p390
aVI just got back from Papua New Guinea
p391
aVwhere I went up to the highlands \u2014
p392
aVvery isolated tribes of subsistence farmers
p393
aVliving as they have lived for millenia.
p394
aVThere are 800 different languages in the highlands.
p395
aVThese are the most primitive people in the world.
p396
aVAnd they indeed also release oxytocin.
p397
aa(lp398
VSo oxytocin connects us to other people.
p399
aVOxytocin makes us feel what other people feel.
p400
aVAnd it's so easy to cause people's brains
p401
aVto release oxytocin.
p402
aVI know how to do it,
p403
aVand my favorite way to do it is, in fact, the easiest.
p404
aVLet me show it to you.
p405
aVCome here. Give me a hug.
p406
aV(Laughter)
p407
aVThere you go.
p408
aa(lp409
V(Applause)
p410
aa(lp411
VSo my penchant for hugging other people
p412
aVhas earned me the nickname Dr. Love.
p413
aVI'm happy to share a little more love in the world,
p414
aVit's great,
p415
aVbut here's your prescription from Dr. Love:
p416
aVeight hugs a day.
p417
aVWe have found that people who release more oxytocin
p418
aVare happier.
p419
aVAnd they're happier
p420
aVbecause they have better relationships of all types.
p421
aVDr. Love says eight hugs a day.
p422
aVEight hugs a day \u2014 you'll be happier
p423
aVand the world will be a better place.
p424
aVOf course, if you don't like to touch people, I can always shove this up your nose.
p425
aa(lp426
V(Laughter)
p427
aa(lp428
VThank you.

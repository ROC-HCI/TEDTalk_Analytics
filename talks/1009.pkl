VMountain biking in Israel
p5
aVis something that I do with great passion
p6
aVand commitment.
p7
aVAnd when I'm on my bike,
p8
aVI feel that I connect
p9
aVwith the profound beauty of Israel,
p10
aVand I feel that I'm united
p11
aVwith this country's history
p12
aVand biblical law.
p13
aVAnd also, for me,
p14
aVbiking is a matter of empowerment.
p15
aVWhen I reach the summit
p16
aVof a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere,
p17
aVI feel young,
p18
aVinvincible, eternal.
p19
aVIt's as if I'm connecting with some legacy
p20
aVor with some energy
p21
aVfar greater than myself.
p22
aVYou can see my fellow riders
p23
aVat the end of the picture,
p24
aVlooking at me with some concern.
p25
aVAnd here is another picture of them.
p26
aVUnfortunately, I cannot show their faces,
p27
aVneither can I disclose their true names,
p28
aVand that's because my fellow riders
p29
aVare juvenile inmates,
p30
aVoffenders
p31
aVspending time in a correction facility
p32
aVabout 20 minutes' ride from here \u2014
p33
aVwell, like everything in Israel.
p34
aVAnd I've been riding with these kids once a week,
p35
aVevery Tuesday, rain or shine, for the last four years
p36
aVand by now, they've become a very big part of my life.
p37
aa(lp38
VThis story began four years ago.
p39
aVThe correction facility where they are locked up
p40
aVhappens to be right in the middle
p41
aVof one of my usual trips,
p42
aVand it's surrounded by barbed wires
p43
aVand electric gates and armed guards.
p44
aVSo on one of these rides,
p45
aVI talked my way into the compound
p46
aVand went to see the warden.
p47
aVI told the warden
p48
aVthat I wanted to start a mountain biking club in this place
p49
aVand that basically I wanted to take the kids
p50
aVfrom here to there.
p51
aVAnd I told him, "Let's find a way
p52
aVin which I'll be able to take out 10 kids once a week
p53
aVto ride with in the summer in the country."
p54
aVAnd the warden was quite amused,
p55
aVand he told me he thought that I was a nut
p56
aVand he told me,
p57
aV"This place is a correction facility. These guys are serious offenders.
p58
aVThey are supposed to be locked up.
p59
aVThey aren't supposed to be out at large."
p60
aVAnd yet, we began to talk about it,
p61
aVand one thing led to another.
p62
aVAnd I can't see myself
p63
aVgoing into a state prison in New Jersey
p64
aVand making such a proposition,
p65
aVbut this being Israel,
p66
aVthe warden somehow made it happen.
p67
aVAnd so two months later,
p68
aVwe found ourselves "at large" \u2014
p69
aVmyself,
p70
aV10 juvenile inmates
p71
aVand a wonderful fellow named Russ,
p72
aVwho became a very good friend of mine
p73
aVand my partner in this project.
p74
aa(lp75
VAnd in the next few weeks, I had the tremendous pleasure
p76
aVof introducing these kids
p77
aVto the world of total freedom,
p78
aVa world consisting of magnificent vistas
p79
aVlike these \u2014
p80
aVeverything you see here is obviously in Israel \u2014
p81
aVas well as close encounters
p82
aVwith all sorts of small creatures
p83
aVcoming in all sorts of sizes,
p84
aVcolors, shapes, forms
p85
aVand so on.
p86
aVIn spite of all this splendor,
p87
aVthe beginning was extremely frustrating.
p88
aVEvery small obstacle,
p89
aVevery slight uphill,
p90
aVwould cause these fellows
p91
aVto stop in their tracks and give up.
p92
aVSo we had a lot of this going on.
p93
aVI found out that they had a very hard time
p94
aVdealing with frustration and difficulties \u2014
p95
aVnot because they were physically unfit.
p96
aVBut that's one reason why they ended up where they were.
p97
aVAnd I became increasingly more and more agitated,
p98
aVbecause I was there
p99
aVnot only to be with them,
p100
aVbut also to ride and create a team
p101
aVand I didn't know what to do.
p102
aa(lp103
VNow, let me give you an example.
p104
aVWe're going downhill in some rocky terrain,
p105
aVand the front tire of Alex
p106
aVgets caught in one of these crevasses here.
p107
aVSo he crashes down,
p108
aVand he gets slightly injured,
p109
aVbut this does not prevent him from jumping up
p110
aVand then starting to jump up and down on his bike
p111
aVand curse violently.
p112
aVThen he throws his helmet in the air.
p113
aVHis backpack goes ballistic in some other direction.
p114
aVAnd then he runs to the nearest tree
p115
aVand starts to break branches and throw rocks
p116
aVand curse like I've never heard.
p117
aVAnd I'm just standing there,
p118
aVwatching this scene
p119
aVwith a complete disbelief,
p120
aVnot knowing what to do.
p121
aVI'm used to algorithms
p122
aVand data structures
p123
aVand super motivated students,
p124
aVand nothing in my background
p125
aVprepared me to deal
p126
aVwith a raging, violent adolescent
p127
aVin the middle of nowhere.
p128
aVAnd you have to realize that these incidents
p129
aVdid not happen in convenient locations.
p130
aVThey happened in places like this,
p131
aVin the Judean Desert,
p132
aV20 kilometers away from the nearest road.
p133
aVAnd what you don't see in this picture
p134
aVis that somewhere between these riders there,
p135
aVthere's a teenager sitting on a rock,
p136
aVsaying, "I'm not moving from here. Forget it.
p137
aVI've had it."
p138
aVWell, that's a problem
p139
aVbecause one way or another, you have to get this guy moving
p140
aVbecause it's getting dark soon and dangerous.
p141
aa(lp142
VIt took me several such incidents to figure out what I was supposed to do.
p143
aVAt the beginning, it was a disaster.
p144
aVI tried harsh words and threats
p145
aVand they took me nowhere.
p146
aVThat's what they had all their lives.
p147
aVAnd at some point I found out,
p148
aVwhen a kid like this gets into a fit,
p149
aVthe best thing that you can possibly do
p150
aVis stay as close as possible to this kid,
p151
aVwhich is difficult,
p152
aVbecause what you really want to do is go away.
p153
aVBut that's what he had all his life,
p154
aVpeople walking away from him.
p155
aVSo what you have to do is stay close
p156
aVand try to reach in
p157
aVand pet his shoulder
p158
aVor give him a piece of chocolate.
p159
aVSo I would say, "Alex, I know that it's terribly difficult.
p160
aVWhy don't you rest for a few minutes
p161
aVand then we'll go on."
p162
aV"Go away you maniac-psychopath.
p163
aVWhy would you bring us to this goddamn place?"
p164
aVAnd I would say, "Relax, Alex.
p165
aVHere's a piece of chocolate."
p166
aVAnd Alex would go, "Arrrrggg!"
p167
aVBecause you have to understand
p168
aVthat on these rides we are constantly hungry \u2014
p169
aVand after the rides also.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd who is this guy, Alex, to begin with?
p172
aVHe's a 17-year-old.
p173
aVWhen he was eight,
p174
aVsomeone put him on a boat in Odessa
p175
aVand sent him, shipped him to Israel
p176
aVon his own.
p177
aVAnd he ended up in south Tel Aviv
p178
aVand did not have the good luck
p179
aVto be picked up by a [unclear]
p180
aVand roamed the streets
p181
aVand became a prominent gang member.
p182
aVAnd he spent the last 10 years of his life
p183
aVin two places only,
p184
aVthe slums and the state prison,
p185
aVwhere he spent the last two years
p186
aVbefore he ended up sitting on this rock there.
p187
aVAnd so this kid
p188
aVwas probably abused,
p189
aVabandoned, ignored, betrayed
p190
aVby almost every adult along the way.
p191
aVSo, for such a kid,
p192
aVwhen an adult that he learns to respect stays close to him
p193
aVand doesn't walk away from him
p194
aVin any situation,
p195
aVirrespective of how he behaves,
p196
aVit's a tremendous healing experience.
p197
aVIt's an act of unconditional acceptance,
p198
aVsomething that he never had.
p199
aa(lp200
VI want to say a few words about vision.
p201
aVWhen I started this program four years ago,
p202
aVI had this original plan
p203
aVof creating a team
p204
aVof winning underdogs.
p205
aVI had an image of Lance Armstrong
p206
aVin my mind.
p207
aVAnd it took me exactly two months
p208
aVof complete frustration
p209
aVto realize that this vision
p210
aVwas misplaced,
p211
aVand that there was another vision
p212
aVsupremely more important
p213
aVand more readily available.
p214
aVIt all of a sudden dawned on me, in this project,
p215
aVthat the purpose of these rides
p216
aVshould actually be
p217
aVto expose the kids
p218
aVto one thing only: love.
p219
aVLove to the country, to the uphill
p220
aVand the downhill,
p221
aVto all the incredible creatures that surround us \u2014
p222
aVthe animals, the plants,
p223
aVthe insects \u2014
p224
aVlove and respect
p225
aVto other fellow members in your team,
p226
aVin your biking team,
p227
aVand most importantly,
p228
aVlove and respect to yourself,
p229
aVwhich is something
p230
aVthat they badly miss.
p231
aa(lp232
VTogether with the kids,
p233
aVI also went through a remarkable transformation.
p234
aVNow, I come from a cutthroat world
p235
aVof science and high technology.
p236
aVI used to think that reason and logic
p237
aVand relentless drive
p238
aVwere the only ways to make things happen.
p239
aVAnd before I worked with the kids,
p240
aVanything that I did with them,
p241
aVor anything that I did with myself,
p242
aVwas supposed to be perfect,
p243
aVideal, optimal,
p244
aVbut after working with them for some time,
p245
aVI discovered the great virtues of empathy
p246
aVand flexibility
p247
aVand being able to start with some vision,
p248
aVand if the vision doesn't work, well nothing happened.
p249
aVAll you have to do is play with it, change it a little bit,
p250
aVand come up with something that does help, that does work.
p251
aVSo right now, I feel more
p252
aVlike these are my principles,
p253
aVand if you don't like them,
p254
aVI have others.
p255
aa(lp256
V(Laughter)
p257
aa(lp258
V(Applause)
p259
aa(lp260
VAnd one of these principles
p261
aVis focus.
p262
aVBefore each ride
p263
aVwe sit together with the kids,
p264
aVand we give them one word
p265
aVto think about during the ride.
p266
aVYou have to focus their attention on something
p267
aVbecause so many things happen.
p268
aVSo these are words like "teamwork"
p269
aVor "endurance"
p270
aVor even complicated concepts
p271
aVlike "resource allocation"
p272
aVor "perspective," a word that they don't understand.
p273
aVYou know, perspective
p274
aVis one of these critically important
p275
aVlife-coping strategies
p276
aVthat mountain biking can really teach you.
p277
aVI tell kids
p278
aVwhen they struggle through some uphill
p279
aVand feel like they cannot take it anymore,
p280
aVit really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles
p281
aVand raise your head and look around
p282
aVand see how the vista around you grows.
p283
aVIt literally propels you upwards.
p284
aVThat's what perspective is all about.
p285
aVOr you can also look back in time
p286
aVand realize that you've already conquered
p287
aVsteeper mountains before.
p288
aVAnd that's how they develop self-esteem.
p289
aa(lp290
VNow, let me give you an example of how it works.
p291
aVYou stand with your bike at the beginning of February.
p292
aVIt's very cold, and you're standing in one of these rainy days,
p293
aVand it's drizzling
p294
aVand cold and chilly,
p295
aVand you're standing in, let's say, Yokneam.
p296
aVAnd you look up at the sky through a hole in the clouds
p297
aVyou see the monastery at the top of the Muhraka \u2014
p298
aVthat's where you're supposed to climb now \u2014
p299
aVand you say, "There's no way that I could possibly get there."
p300
aVAnd yet, two hours later
p301
aVyou find yourself standing on the roof of this monastery,
p302
aVsmeared with mud,
p303
aVblood and sweat.
p304
aVAnd you look down at Yokneam;
p305
aVeverything is so small and tiny.
p306
aVAnd you say, "Hey, Alex. Look at this parking lot where we started.
p307
aVIt's that big.
p308
aVI can't believe that I did it."
p309
aVAnd that's the point
p310
aVwhen you start loving yourself.
p311
aa(lp312
VAnd so we talked about
p313
aVthese special words that we teach them.
p314
aVAnd at the end of each ride, we sit together
p315
aVand share moments
p316
aVin which those special words of the day
p317
aVpopped up and made a difference,
p318
aVand these discussions
p319
aVcan be extremely inspiring.
p320
aVIn one of them, one of the kids once said,
p321
aV"When we were riding on this ridge
p322
aVoverlooking the Dead Sea \u2014
p323
aVand he's talking about this spot here \u2014
p324
aV"I was reminded
p325
aVof the day when I left my village in Ethiopia
p326
aVand went away together with my brother.
p327
aVWe walked 120 kilometers
p328
aVuntil we reached Sudan.
p329
aVThis was the first place where we got some water and supplies."
p330
aVAnd he goes on saying, and everyone looks at him like a hero,
p331
aVprobably for the first time in his life.
p332
aVAnd he says \u2014 because I also have volunteers riding with me,
p333
aVadults, who are sitting there
p334
aVlistening to him \u2014
p335
aVand he says, "And this was just the beginning
p336
aVof our ordeal
p337
aVuntil we ended up in Israel.
p338
aVAnd only now," he says,
p339
aV"I'm beginning to understand where I am,
p340
aVand I actually like it."
p341
aVNow I remember, when he said it,
p342
aVI felt goosebumps on my body,
p343
aVbecause he said it overlooking the Moab Mountains here in the background.
p344
aVThat's where Joshua descended
p345
aVand crossed the Jordan
p346
aVand led the people of Israel into the land of Canaan
p347
aV3,000 years ago
p348
aVin this final leg
p349
aVof the journey from Africa.
p350
aa(lp351
VAnd so, perspective
p352
aVand context and history
p353
aVplay key roles
p354
aVin the way I plan my rides
p355
aVwith the kids.
p356
aVWe visit Kibbutzim
p357
aVthat were established by Holocaust survivors.
p358
aVWe explore ruins
p359
aVof Palestinian villages,
p360
aVand we discuss how they became ruins.
p361
aVAnd we go through numerous remnants
p362
aVof Jewish settlements, Nabatic settlements,
p363
aVCanaanite settlements \u2014
p364
aVthree-, four, five-thousand years old.
p365
aVAnd through this tapestry,
p366
aVwhich is the history of this country,
p367
aVthe kids acquire
p368
aVwhat is probably the most important
p369
aVvalue in education,
p370
aVand that is the understanding that life is complex,
p371
aVand there's no black and white.
p372
aVAnd by appreciating complexity,
p373
aVthey become more tolerant,
p374
aVand tolerance leads to hope.
p375
aa(lp376
VI ride with these kids once a week,
p377
aVevery Tuesday.
p378
aVHere's a picture I took last Tuesday \u2014 less than a week ago \u2014
p379
aVand I ride with them tomorrow also.
p380
aVIn every one of these rides
p381
aVI always end up standing in one of these incredible locations,
p382
aVtaking in this incredible landscape around me,
p383
aVand I feel blessed and fortunate
p384
aVthat I'm alive,
p385
aVand that I sense every fiber
p386
aVin my aching body.
p387
aVAnd I feel blessed and fortunate
p388
aVthat 15 years ago
p389
aVI had the courage to resign
p390
aVmy tenured position at NYU
p391
aVand return to my home country
p392
aVwhere I can do these incredible rides
p393
aVwith this group of troubled kids
p394
aVcoming from Ethiopia
p395
aVand Morocco and Russia.
p396
aVAnd I feel blessed and fortunate
p397
aVthat every week, every Tuesday \u2014
p398
aVand actually every Friday also \u2014
p399
aVI can once again celebrate
p400
aVin the marrow of my bones
p401
aVthe very essence of living in Israel on the edge.
p402
aa(lp403
VThank you.

helped found in 1995. He&#39;s also taught at NYU, Harvard and Stanford. Together with Noam Nisan he developed a freely available, open-source, self-paced program for learning applied computer science: <a href=\\"http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The Elements of Computing Systems</a>. Offered in 2005, this led to one of the first successful open online courses. Now, courses based on the approach are offered by traditional universities as well as in crowd-sourced settings, and have been taken freely by thousands of self-learners over the web. Registration, lecture and project schedules are managed by volunteer course coordinators, and student questions are answered by the course alumni community. </p><p><br />His current project focuses on developing instructional materials for early-age math education, which he thinks can be transformed using low-cost tablet computers.

VFor the last 50 years,
p5
aVa lot of smart, well-resourced people \u2014 some of you, no doubt \u2014
p6
aVhave been trying to figure out how to reduce poverty
p7
aVin the United States.
p8
aVPeople have created and invested millions of dollars
p9
aVinto non-profit organizations
p10
aVwith the mission of helping people who are poor.
p11
aa(lp12
VThey've created think tanks
p13
aVthat study issues like education, job creation and asset-building,
p14
aVand then advocated for policies to support our most marginalized communities.
p15
aVThey've written books and columns and given passionate speeches,
p16
aVdecrying the wealth gap that is leaving more and more people
p17
aVentrenched at the bottom end of the income scale.
p18
aVAnd that effort has helped.
p19
aVBut it's not enough.
p20
aVOur poverty rates haven't changed that much in the last 50 years,
p21
aVsince the War on Poverty was launched.
p22
aVI'm here to tell you
p23
aVthat we have overlooked the most powerful and practical resource.
p24
aVHere it is:
p25
aVpeople who are poor.
p26
aa(lp27
VUp in the left-hand corner is Jobana, Sintia and Bertha.
p28
aVThey met when they all had small children,
p29
aVthrough a parenting class at a family resource center
p30
aVin San Francisco.
p31
aVAs they grew together as parents and friends,
p32
aVthey talked a lot about how hard it was
p33
aVto make money when your kids are little.
p34
aVChild care is expensive,
p35
aVmore than they'd earn in a job.
p36
aVTheir husbands worked,
p37
aVbut they wanted to contribute financially, too.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo they hatched a plan.
p40
aVThey started a cleaning business.
p41
aVThey plastered neighborhoods with flyers
p42
aVand handed business cards out to their families and friends,
p43
aVand soon, they had clients calling.
p44
aVTwo of them would clean the office or house
p45
aVand one of them would watch the kids.
p46
aVThey'd rotate who'd cleaned and who'd watch the kids.
p47
aV(Laughs) It's awesome, right?
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd they split the money three ways.
p52
aVIt was not a full-time gig,
p53
aVno one could watch the little ones all day.
p54
aVBut it made a difference for their families.
p55
aVExtra money to pay for bills when a husband's work hours were cut.
p56
aVMoney to buy the kids clothes as they were growing.
p57
aVA little extra money in their pockets
p58
aVto make them feel some independence.
p59
aa(lp60
VUp in the top-right corner is Theresa and her daughter, Brianna.
p61
aVBrianna is one of those kids
p62
aVwith this sparkly, infectious, outgoing personality.
p63
aVFor example, when Rosie,
p64
aVa little girl who spoke only Spanish, moved in next door,
p65
aVBrianna, who spoke only English,
p66
aVborrowed her mother's tablet and found a translation app
p67
aVso the two of them could communicate.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VI know, right?
p72
aVRosie's family credits Brianna with helping Rosie to learn English.
p73
aa(lp74
VA few years ago,
p75
aVBrianna started to struggle academically.
p76
aVShe was growing frustrated and kind of withdrawn
p77
aVand acting out in class.
p78
aVAnd her mother was heartbroken over what was happening.
p79
aVThen they found out that she was going to have to repeat second grade
p80
aVand Brianna was devastated.
p81
aVHer mother felt hopeless and overwhelmed and alone
p82
aVbecause she knew that her daughter was not getting the support she needed,
p83
aVand she did not know how to help her.
p84
aVOne afternoon, Theresa was catching up with a group of friends,
p85
aVand one of them said,
p86
aV"Theresa, how are you?"
p87
aVAnd she burst into tears.
p88
aVAfter she shared her story, one of her friends said,
p89
aV"I went through the exact same thing with my son about a year ago."
p90
aVAnd in that moment,
p91
aVTheresa realized that so much of her struggle
p92
aVwas not having anybody to talk with about it.
p93
aVSo she created a support group for parents like her.
p94
aVThe first meeting was her and two other people.
p95
aVBut word spread, and soon 20 people, 30 people
p96
aVwere showing up for these monthly meetings that she put together.
p97
aVShe went from feeling helpless
p98
aVto realizing how capable she was of supporting her daughter,
p99
aVwith the support of other people who were going through the same struggle.
p100
aVAnd Brianna is doing fantastic \u2014 she's doing great academically
p101
aVand socially.
p102
aa(lp103
VThat in the middle is my man Baakir,
p104
aVstanding in front of BlackStar Books and Caffe,
p105
aVwhich he runs out of part of his house.
p106
aVAs you walk in the door,
p107
aVBaakir greets you with a "Welcome black home."
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VOnce inside, you can order some Algiers jerk chicken,
p112
aVperhaps a vegan walnut burger,
p113
aVor jive turkey sammich.
p114
aVAnd that's sammich \u2014 not sandwich.
p115
aVYou must finish your meal with a buttermilk drop,
p116
aVwhich is several steps above a donut hole
p117
aVand made from a very secret family recipe.
p118
aVFor real, it's very secret, he won't tell you about it.
p119
aa(lp120
VBut BlackStar is much more than a café.
p121
aVFor the kids in the neighborhood,
p122
aVit's a place to go after school to get help with homework.
p123
aVFor the grown-ups, it's where they go
p124
aVto find out what's going on in the neighborhood
p125
aVand catch up with friends.
p126
aVIt's a performance venue.
p127
aVIt's a home for poets, musicians and artists.
p128
aVBaakir and his partner Nicole,
p129
aVwith their baby girl strapped to her back,
p130
aVare there in the mix of it all,
p131
aVserving up a cup of coffee,
p132
aVteaching a child how to play Mancala,
p133
aVor painting a sign for an upcoming community event.
p134
aa(lp135
VI have worked with and learned from people just like them
p136
aVfor more than 20 years.
p137
aVI have organized against the prison system,
p138
aVwhich impacts poor folks,
p139
aVespecially black, indigenous and Latino folks,
p140
aVat an alarming rate.
p141
aVI have worked with young people who manifest hope and promise,
p142
aVdespite being at the effect of racist discipline practices in their schools,
p143
aVand police violence in their communities.
p144
aVI have learned from families
p145
aVwho are unleashing their ingenuity and tenacity
p146
aVto collectively create their own solutions.
p147
aVAnd they're not just focused on money.
p148
aVThey're addressing education, housing, health, community \u2014
p149
aVthe things that we all care about.
p150
aVEverywhere I go,
p151
aVI see people who are broke but not broken.
p152
aVI see people who are struggling to realize their good ideas,
p153
aVso that they can create a better life for themselves,
p154
aVtheir families, their communities.
p155
aVJobana, Sintia, Bertha, Theresa and Baakir are the rule,
p156
aVnot the shiny exception.
p157
aVI am the exception.
p158
aa(lp159
VI was raised by a quietly fierce single mother in Rochester, New York.
p160
aVI was bussed to a school in the suburbs, from a neighborhood
p161
aVthat many of my classmates and their parents considered dangerous.
p162
aVAt eight, I was a latchkey kid.
p163
aVI'd get myself home after school every day and do homework and chores,
p164
aVand wait for my mother to come home.
p165
aVAfter school, I'd go to the corner store
p166
aVand buy a can of Chef Boyardee ravioli,
p167
aVwhich I'd heat up on the stove as my afternoon snack.
p168
aVIf I had a little extra money, I'd buy a Hostess Fruit Pie.
p169
aa(lp170
V(Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
VCherry.
p173
aVNot as good as a buttermilk drop.
p174
aa(lp175
V(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VWe were poor when I was a kid.
p178
aVBut now, I own a home in a quickly gentrifying neighborhood
p179
aVin Oakland, California.
p180
aVI've built a career.
p181
aVMy husband is a business owner.
p182
aVI have a retirement account.
p183
aVMy daughter is not even allowed to turn on the stove
p184
aVunless there's a grown-up at home
p185
aVand she doesn't have to,
p186
aVbecause she does not have to have the same kind of self-reliance
p187
aVthat I had to at her age.
p188
aVMy kids' raviolis are organic
p189
aVand full of things like spinach and ricotta,
p190
aVbecause I have the luxury of choice
p191
aVwhen it comes to what my children eat.
p192
aa(lp193
VI am the exception,
p194
aVnot because I'm more talented than Baakir
p195
aVor my mother worked any harder than Jobana, Sintia or Bertha,
p196
aVor cared any more than Theresa.
p197
aVMarginalized communities are full of smart, talented people,
p198
aVhustling and working and innovating,
p199
aVjust like our most revered and most rewarded CEOs.
p200
aVThey are full of people tapping into their resilience
p201
aVto get up every day, get the kids off to school
p202
aVand go to jobs that don't pay enough,
p203
aVor get educations that are putting them in debt.
p204
aVThey are full of people applying their savvy intelligence
p205
aVto stretch a minimum wage paycheck,
p206
aVor balance a job and a side hustle to make ends meet.
p207
aVThey are full of people doing for themselves and for others,
p208
aVwhether it's picking up medication for an elderly neighbor,
p209
aVor letting a sibling borrow some money to pay the phone bill,
p210
aVor just watching out for the neighborhood kids
p211
aVfrom the front stoop.
p212
aa(lp213
VI am the exception because of luck and privilege,
p214
aVnot hard work.
p215
aVAnd I'm not being modest or self-deprecating \u2014
p216
aVI am amazing.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VBut most people work hard.
p221
aVHard work is the common denominator in this equation,
p222
aVand I'm tired of the story we tell
p223
aVthat hard work leads to success,
p224
aVbecause that allows \u2014
p225
aa(lp226
VThank you.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Applause)
p229
aa(lp230
V... because that story allows those of us who make it to believe we deserve it,
p231
aVand by implication,
p232
aVthose who don't make it don't deserve it.
p233
aVWe tell ourselves, in the back of our minds,
p234
aVand sometimes in the front of our mouths,
p235
aV"There must be something a little wrong with those poor people."
p236
aVWe have a wide range of beliefs
p237
aVabout what that something wrong is.
p238
aVSome people tell the story that poor folks are lazy freeloaders
p239
aVwho would cheat and lie to get out of an honest day's work.
p240
aVOthers prefer the story that poor people are helpless
p241
aVand probably had neglectful parents that didn't read to them enough,
p242
aVand if they were just told what to do
p243
aVand shown the right path,
p244
aVthey could make it.
p245
aa(lp246
VFor every story I hear demonizing low-income single mothers
p247
aVor absentee fathers,
p248
aVwhich is how people might think of my parents,
p249
aVI've got 50 that tell a different story about the same people,
p250
aVshowing up every day and doing their best.
p251
aVI'm not saying that some of the negative stories aren't true,
p252
aVbut those stories allow us to not really see who people really are,
p253
aVbecause they don't paint a full picture.
p254
aVThe quarter-truths and limited plot lines have us convinced
p255
aVthat poor people are a problem that needs fixing.
p256
aVWhat if we recognized that what's working is the people
p257
aVand what's broken is our approach?
p258
aVWhat if we realized that the experts we are looking for,
p259
aVthe experts we need to follow,
p260
aVare poor people themselves?
p261
aVWhat if, instead of imposing solutions,
p262
aVwe just added fire
p263
aVto the already-burning flame that they have?
p264
aVNot directing \u2014
p265
aVnot even empowering \u2014
p266
aVbut just fueling their initiative.
p267
aa(lp268
VJust north of here,
p269
aVwe have an example of what this could look like:
p270
aVSilicon Valley.
p271
aVA whole venture capital industry has grown up around the belief
p272
aVthat if people have good ideas and the desire to manifest them,
p273
aVwe should give them lots and lots and lots of money.
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
VRight? But where is our strategy for Theresa and Baakir?
p278
aVThere are no incubators for them,
p279
aVno accelerators, no fellowships.
p280
aVHow are Jobana, Sintia and Bertha really all that different
p281
aVfrom the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world?
p282
aVBaakir has experience and a track record.
p283
aVI'd put my money on him.
p284
aa(lp285
VSo, consider this an invitation to rethink a flawed strategy.
p286
aVLet's grasp this opportunity
p287
aVto let go of a tired, faulty narrative
p288
aVand listen and look for true stories,
p289
aVmore beautifully complex stories,
p290
aVabout who marginalized people and families and communities are.
p291
aa(lp292
VI'm going to take a minute to speak to my people.
p293
aVWe cannot wait
p294
aVfor somebody else to get it right.
p295
aVLet us remember what we are capable of;
p296
aVall that we have built with blood, sweat and dreams;
p297
aVall the cogs that keep turning;
p298
aVand the people kept afloat because of our backbreaking work.
p299
aVLet us remember that we are magic.
p300
aVIf you need some inspiration to jog your memory,
p301
aVread Octavia Butler's "Parable of the Sower."
p302
aVListen to Reverend King's "Letter from Birmingham Jail."
p303
aVListen to Suheir Hammad recite "First Writing Since,"
p304
aVor Esperanza Spalding perform "Black Gold."
p305
aVSet your gaze upon the art of Kehinde Wiley
p306
aVor Favianna Rodriguez.
p307
aVLook at the hands of your grandmother
p308
aVor into the eyes of someone who loves you.
p309
aVWe are magic.
p310
aVIndividually, we don't have a lot of wealth and power,
p311
aVbut collectively, we are unstoppable.
p312
aVAnd we spend a lot of our time and energy
p313
aVorganizing our power to demand change from systems that were not made for us.
p314
aVInstead of trying to alter the fabric of existing ways,
p315
aVlet's weave and cut some fierce new cloth.
p316
aVLet's use some of our substantial collective power
p317
aVtoward inventing and bringing to life
p318
aVnew ways of being that work for us.
p319
aa(lp320
VDesmond Tutu talks about the concept of ubuntu,
p321
aVin the context of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation process
p322
aVthat they embarked on after apartheid.
p323
aVHe says it means,
p324
aV"My humanity is caught up, is inextricably bound up, in yours;
p325
aVwe belong to a bundle of life."
p326
aVA bundle of life.
p327
aVThe Truth and Reconciliation process
p328
aVstarted by elevating the voices of the unheard.
p329
aVIf this country is going to live up to its promise of liberty and justice for all,
p330
aVthen we need to elevate the voices of our unheard,
p331
aVof people like Jobana, Sintia and Bertha,
p332
aVTheresa and Baakir.
p333
aVWe must leverage their solutions and their ideas.
p334
aVWe must listen to their true stories,
p335
aVtheir more beautifully complex stories.
p336
aa(lp337
VThank you.

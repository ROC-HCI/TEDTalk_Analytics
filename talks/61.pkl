VIf you haven't ordered yet, I generally find the rigatoni with the spicy tomato sauce
p5
aVgoes best with diseases of the small intestine.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VSo, sorry \u2014 it just feels like I should be doing stand-up up here because of the setting.
p10
aVNo, what I want to do is take you back to 1854
p11
aVin London for the next few minutes, and tell the story \u2014
p12
aVin brief \u2014 of this outbreak,
p13
aVwhich in many ways, I think, helped create the world that we live in today,
p14
aVand particularly the kind of city that we live in today.
p15
aVThis period in 1854, in the middle part of the 19th century,
p16
aVin London's history, is incredibly interesting for a number of reasons.
p17
aVBut I think the most important one is that
p18
aVLondon was this city of 2.5 million people,
p19
aVand it was the largest city on the face of the planet at that point.
p20
aVBut it was also the largest city that had ever been built.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd so the Victorians were trying to live through
p23
aVand simultaneously invent a whole new scale of living:
p24
aVthis scale of living that we, you know, now call "metropolitan living."
p25
aVAnd it was in many ways, at this point in the mid-1850s, a complete disaster.
p26
aVThey were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis
p27
aVwith an Elizabethan public infrastructure.
p28
aVSo people, for instance, just to gross you out for a second,
p29
aVhad cesspools of human waste in their basement. Like, a foot to two feet deep.
p30
aVAnd they would just kind of throw the buckets down there
p31
aVand hope that it would somehow go away,
p32
aVand of course it never really would go away.
p33
aVAnd all of this stuff, basically, had accumulated to the point
p34
aVwhere the city was incredibly offensive to just walk around in.
p35
aa(lp36
VIt was an amazingly smelly city. Not just because of the cesspools,
p37
aVbut also the sheer number of livestock in the city would shock people.
p38
aVNot just the horses, but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk,
p39
aVthat they would hoist up there and keep them in the attic
p40
aVuntil literally their milk ran out and they died,
p41
aVand then they would drag them off to the bone boilers down the street.
p42
aVSo, you would just walk around London at this point
p43
aVand just be overwhelmed with this stench.
p44
aVAnd what ended up happening is that an entire emerging public health system
p45
aVbecame convinced that it was the smell that was killing everybody,
p46
aVthat was creating these diseases
p47
aVthat would wipe through the city every three or four years.
p48
aVAnd cholera was really the great killer of this period.
p49
aa(lp50
VIt arrived in London in 1832, and every four or five years
p51
aVanother epidemic would take 10,000, 20,000 people in London
p52
aVand throughout the U.K.
p53
aVAnd so the authorities became convinced that this smell was this problem.
p54
aVWe had to get rid of the smell.
p55
aVAnd so, in fact, they concocted a couple of early, you know,
p56
aVfounding public-health interventions in the system of the city,
p57
aVone of which was called the "Nuisances Act,"
p58
aVwhich they got everybody as far as they could
p59
aVto empty out their cesspools and just pour all that waste into the river.
p60
aVBecause if we get it out of the streets, it'll smell much better,
p61
aVand \u2014 oh right, we drink from the river.
p62
aVSo what ended up happening, actually,
p63
aVis they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera
p64
aVbecause, as we now know, cholera is actually in the water.
p65
aVIt's a waterborne disease, not something that's in the air.
p66
aVIt's not something you smell or inhale; it's something you ingest.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd so one of the founding moments of public health in the 19th century
p69
aVeffectively poisoned the water supply of London much more effectively
p70
aVthan any modern day bioterrorist could have ever dreamed of doing.
p71
aVSo this was the state of London in 1854,
p72
aVand in the middle of all this carnage and offensive conditions,
p73
aVand in the midst of all this scientific confusion
p74
aVabout what was actually killing people,
p75
aVit was a very talented classic 19th century multi-disciplinarian named John Snow,
p76
aVwho was a local doctor in Soho in London,
p77
aVwho had been arguing for about four or five years
p78
aVthat cholera was, in fact, a waterborne disease,
p79
aVand had basically convinced nobody of this.
p80
aVThe public health authorities had largely ignored what he had to say.
p81
aVAnd he'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies,
p82
aVbut nothing had really stuck.
p83
aVAnd part of \u2014 what's so interesting about this story to me
p84
aVis that in some ways, it's a great case study in how cultural change happens,
p85
aVhow a good idea eventually comes to win out over much worse ideas.
p86
aVAnd Snow labored for a long time with this great insight that everybody ignored.
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd then on one day, August 28th of 1854,
p89
aVa young child, a five-month-old girl whose first name we don't know,
p90
aVwe know her only as Baby Lewis, somehow contracted cholera,
p91
aVcame down with cholera at 40 Broad Street.
p92
aVYou can't really see it in this map, but this is the map
p93
aVthat becomes the central focus in the second half of my book.
p94
aVIt's in the middle of Soho, in this working class neighborhood,
p95
aVthis little girl becomes sick and it turns out that the cesspool,
p96
aVthat they still continue to have, despite the Nuisances Act,
p97
aVbordered on an extremely popular water pump,
p98
aVlocal watering hole that was well known for the best water in all of Soho,
p99
aVthat all the residents from Soho and the surrounding neighborhoods would go to.
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd so this little girl inadvertently ended up
p102
aVcontaminating the water in this popular pump,
p103
aVand one of the most terrifying outbreaks in the history of England
p104
aVerupted about two or three days later.
p105
aVLiterally, 10 percent of the neighborhood died in seven days,
p106
aVand much more would have died if people hadn't fled
p107
aVafter the initial outbreak kicked in.
p108
aVSo it was this incredibly terrifying event.
p109
aVYou had these scenes of entire families dying
p110
aVover the course of 48 hours of cholera,
p111
aValone in their one-room apartments, in their little flats.
p112
aVJust an extraordinary, terrifying scene.
p113
aVSnow lived near there, heard about the outbreak,
p114
aVand in this amazing act of courage went directly into the belly of the beast
p115
aVbecause he thought an outbreak that concentrated
p116
aVcould actually potentially end up convincing people that,
p117
aVin fact, the real menace of cholera was in the water supply and not in the air.
p118
aVHe suspected an outbreak that concentrated
p119
aVwould probably involve a single point source.
p120
aVOne single thing that everybody was going to
p121
aVbecause it didn't have the traditional slower path
p122
aVof infections that you might expect.
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd so he went right in there and started interviewing people.
p125
aVHe eventually enlisted the help of this amazing other figure,
p126
aVwho's kind of the other protagonist of the book \u2014
p127
aVthis guy, Henry Whitehead, who was a local minister,
p128
aVwho was not at all a man of science, but was incredibly socially connected;
p129
aVhe knew everybody in the neighborhood.
p130
aVAnd he managed to track down, Whitehead did,
p131
aVmany of the cases of people who had drunk water from the pump,
p132
aVor who hadn't drunk water from the pump.
p133
aVAnd eventually Snow made a map of the outbreak.
p134
aVHe found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick.
p135
aVPeople who hadn't drunk from the pump were not getting sick.
p136
aVAnd he thought about representing that
p137
aVas a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods,
p138
aVpeople who hadn't, you know, percentages of people who hadn't,
p139
aVbut eventually he hit upon the idea
p140
aVthat what he needed was something that you could see.
p141
aVSomething that would take in a sense a higher-level view
p142
aVof all this activity that had been happening in the neighborhood.
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd so he created this map,
p145
aVwhich basically ended up representing all the deaths in the neighborhoods
p146
aVas black bars at each address.
p147
aVAnd you can see in this map, the pump right at the center of it
p148
aVand you can see that one of the residences down the way
p149
aVhad about 15 people dead.
p150
aVAnd the map is actually a little bit bigger.
p151
aVAs you get further and further away from the pump,
p152
aVthe deaths begin to grow less and less frequent.
p153
aVAnd so you can see this something poisonous
p154
aVemanating out of this pump that you could see in a glance.
p155
aVAnd so, with the help of this map,
p156
aVand with the help of more evangelizing
p157
aVthat he did over the next few years
p158
aVand that Whitehead did, eventually, actually,
p159
aVthe authorities slowly started to come around.
p160
aVIt took much longer than sometimes we like to think in this story,
p161
aVbut by 1866, when the next big cholera outbreak came to London,
p162
aVthe authorities had been convinced \u2014 in part because of this story,
p163
aVin part because of this map \u2014 that in fact the water was the problem.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd they had already started building the sewers in London,
p166
aVand they immediately went to this outbreak
p167
aVand they told everybody to start boiling their water.
p168
aVAnd that was the last time that London has seen a cholera outbreak since.
p169
aVSo, part of this story, I think \u2014 well, it's a terrifying story,
p170
aVit's a very dark story and it's a story
p171
aVthat continues on in many of the developing cities of the world.
p172
aVIt's also a story really that is fundamentally optimistic,
p173
aVwhich is to say that it's possible to solve these problems
p174
aVif we listen to reason, if we listen to the kind of wisdom of these kinds of maps,
p175
aVif we listen to people like Snow and Whitehead,
p176
aVif we listen to the locals who understand
p177
aVwhat's going on in these kinds of situations.
p178
aVAnd what it ended up doing is making the idea
p179
aVof large-scale metropolitan living a sustainable one.
p180
aa(lp181
VWhen people were looking at 10 percent of their neighborhoods dying
p182
aVin the space of seven days,
p183
aVthere was a widespread consensus that this couldn't go on,
p184
aVthat people weren't meant to live in cities of 2.5 million people.
p185
aVBut because of what Snow did, because of this map,
p186
aVbecause of the whole series of reforms
p187
aVthat happened in the wake of this map,
p188
aVwe now take for granted that cities have 10 million people,
p189
aVcities like this one are in fact sustainable things.
p190
aVWe don't worry that New York City is going to collapse in on itself
p191
aVquite the way that, you know, Rome did,
p192
aVand be 10 percent of its size in 100 years or 200 years.
p193
aVAnd so that in a way is the ultimate legacy of this map.
p194
aVIt's a map of deaths that ended up creating a whole new way of life,
p195
aVthe life that we're enjoying here today. Thank you very much.

"<p>Steven Johnson is a leading light of today&#39;s interdisciplinary and collaborative approach to innovation. His writings have influenced everything from cutting-edge ideas in urban planning to the battle against 21st-century terrorism. Johnson was chosen by <em>Prospect</em> magazine as one of the top ten brains of the digital future, and <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> calls him &quot;one of the most persuasive advocates for the role of collaboration in innovation.&quot;</p><p>Johnson&#39;s work on the history of innovation inspired the Emmy-nominated six-part series on PBS, &quot;<a href=\\"http://www.pbs.org/show/how-we-got-now/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">How We Got To Now with Steven Johnson</a>,&quot; which aired in the fall of 2014. The book version of&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/S1MU8x\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>How We Got To Now</em></a>&nbsp;was a finalist for the PEN/E.O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award. His new book,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/8yIHeEj\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Wonderland: How Play Made the Modern World</em></a>, revolves around the creative power of play and delight: ideas and innovations that set into motion many momentous changes in science, technology, politics and society.&nbsp;</p><p>Johnson is also the author of the bestselling <em>Where Good Ideas Come From: The Natural History of Innovation</em>, one of his many books celebrating progress and innovation. Others include <em>The Invention of Air</em> and <em>The Ghost Map</em>. <em>Everything Bad Is Good For You</em>, one of the most discussed books of 2005, argued that the increasing complexity of modern media is training us to think in more complex ways. <em>Emergence</em> and <em>Future Perfect</em> explore the power of bottom-up intelligence in both nature and contemporary society.</p><p>An innovator himself, Johnson has co-created three influential sites: the pioneering online magazine FEED, the Webby-Award-winning community site, Plastic.com, and the hyperlocal media site outside.in, which was acquired by AOL in 2011.</p><p>Johnson is a regular contributor to <em>WIRED</em> magazine, as well as the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>&nbsp;and many other periodicals. He has appeared on many high-profile television programs, including &quot;The Charlie Rose Show,&quot; &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; and &quot;The NewsHour with Jim

VWhat I want to do today is to spend
p5
aVsome time talking about some stuff that's
p6
aVsort of giving me a little bit of
p7
aVexistential angst, for lack of a better word,
p8
aVover the past couple of years, and
p9
aVbasically, these three quotes
p10
aVtell what's going on.
p11
aV"When God made the color purple,
p12
aVGod was just showing off," Alice Walker
p13
aVwrote in "The Color Purple," and
p14
aVZora Neale Hurston wrote in
p15
aV"Dust Tracks On A Road,"
p16
aV"Research is a formalized curiosity.
p17
aVIt's poking and prying with a purpose."
p18
aVAnd then finally,
p19
aVwhen I think about the near future,
p20
aVyou know, we have this attitude, well,
p21
aVwhatever happens, happens. Right?
p22
aVSo that goes along with the Chesire Cat
p23
aVsaying, "If you don't care much
p24
aVwhere you want to get to,
p25
aVit doesn't much matter which way you go."
p26
aVBut I think it does matter
p27
aVwhich way we go, and what road we take,
p28
aVbecause when I think about design in the
p29
aVnear future, what I think are the most
p30
aVimportant issues, what's really
p31
aVcrucial and vital is that we need
p32
aVto revitalize the arts and sciences
p33
aVright now in 2002.
p34
aV(Applause)
p35
aVIf we describe the near future
p36
aVas 10, 20, 15 years from now,
p37
aVthat means that what we do today
p38
aVis going to be critically important,
p39
aVbecause in the year 2015,
p40
aVand the year 2020, 2025, the world
p41
aVour society is going to be building on,
p42
aVthe basic knowledge and abstract ideas,
p43
aVthe discoveries that we came up with today,
p44
aVjust as all these wonderful things we're
p45
aVhearing about here at the TED conference
p46
aVthat we take for granted in the world
p47
aVright now, were really knowledge
p48
aVand ideas that came up
p49
aVin the '50s, the '60s, and the '70s.
p50
aVThat's the substrate that we're exploiting
p51
aVtoday, whether it's the internet,
p52
aVgenetic engineering, laser scanners,
p53
aVguided missiles, fiber optics, high-definition
p54
aVtelevision, sensing, remote-sensing
p55
aVfrom space and the wonderful
p56
aVremote-sensing photos that we see in
p57
aV3D weaving, TV programs like Tracker,
p58
aVand Enterprise, CD rewrite drives,
p59
aVflatscreen, Alvin Ailey's Suite Otis,
p60
aVor Sarah Jones' "Your Revolution Will Not
p61
aVBe Between These Thighs," which
p62
aVby the way was banned by the FCC,
p63
aVor ska, all of these things
p64
aVwithout question, almost without exception,
p65
aVare really based on ideas
p66
aVand abstract and creativity
p67
aVfrom years before,
p68
aVso we have to ask ourselves,
p69
aVwhat are we contributing to that legacy
p70
aVright now? And when I think about it,
p71
aVI'm really worried. To be quite frank,
p72
aVI'm concerned. I'm skeptical
p73
aVthat we're doing very much of anything.
p74
aVWe're, in a sense, failing to act
p75
aVin the future. We're purposefully,
p76
aVconsciously being laggards.
p77
aVWe're lagging behind.
p78
aVFrantz Fanon, who was a psychiatrist
p79
aVfrom Martinique, said, "Each generation
p80
aVmust, out of relative obscurity,
p81
aVdiscover its mission, and fulfill or betray it."
p82
aVWhat is our mission? What do we have
p83
aVto do? I think our mission is
p84
aVto reconcile, to reintegrate
p85
aVscience and the arts, because right now
p86
aVthere's a schism that exists
p87
aVin popular culture. You know,
p88
aVpeople have this idea that science
p89
aVand the arts are really separate.
p90
aVWe think of them as separate
p91
aVand different things, and this idea was
p92
aVprobably introduced centuries ago,
p93
aVbut it's really becoming critical now,
p94
aVbecause we're making decisions about our
p95
aVsociety every day that,
p96
aVif we keep thinking that the arts
p97
aVare separate from the sciences,
p98
aVand we keep thinking it's cute to say,
p99
aV"I don't understand anything about this one,
p100
aVI don't understand anything about the other
p101
aVone," then we're going to have problems.
p102
aVNow I know no one here at TED
p103
aVthinks this. All of us, we already know
p104
aVthat they're very connected, but I'm going
p105
aVto let you know that some folks
p106
aVin the outside world, believe it or not,
p107
aVthey think it's neat when they say,
p108
aV"You know, scientists and science is not
p109
aVcreative. Maybe scientists are ingenious,
p110
aVbut they're not creative.
p111
aVAnd then we have this tendency, the career
p112
aVcounselors and various people say things
p113
aVlike, "Artists are not analytical.
p114
aVThey're ingenious, perhaps,
p115
aVbut not analytical," and
p116
aVwhen these concepts underly our teaching
p117
aVand what we think about the world,
p118
aVthen we have a problem, because we
p119
aVstymie support for everything.
p120
aVBy accepting this dichotomy,
p121
aVwhether it's tongue-in-cheek, when
p122
aVwe attempt to accommodate it in our world,
p123
aVand we try to build our foundation
p124
aVfor the world, we're messing up the future,
p125
aVbecause, who wants to be uncreative?
p126
aVWho wants to be illogical?
p127
aVTalent would run from either of these fields
p128
aVif you said you had to choose either.
p129
aVThen they're going to go to something
p130
aVwhere they think, "Well, I can be creative
p131
aVand logical at the same time."
p132
aVNow I grew up in the '60s and I'll admit it,
p133
aVactually, my childhood spanned the '60s,
p134
aVand I was a wannabe hippie and I always
p135
aVresented the fact that I wasn't really
p136
aVold enough to be a hippie.
p137
aVAnd I know there are people here, the
p138
aVyounger generation who want to be hippies,
p139
aVbut people talk about the '60s all the time,
p140
aVand they talk about the anarchy
p141
aVthat was there, but when I think about
p142
aVthe '60s, what I took away from it was
p143
aVthat there was hope for the future.
p144
aVWe thought everyone could participate.
p145
aVThere were wonderful, incredible ideas
p146
aVthat were always percolating,
p147
aVand so much of what's cool or hot today
p148
aVis really based on some of those concepts,
p149
aVwhether it's, you know, people trying to
p150
aVuse the prime directive from Star Trek
p151
aVbeing involved in things, or again that
p152
aVthree-dimensional weaving and
p153
aVfax machines that I read about in my
p154
aVweekly readers that the technology
p155
aVand engineering was just getting started.
p156
aVBut the '60s left me with a problem.
p157
aVYou see, I always assumed I would go
p158
aVinto space, because I followed all of this,
p159
aVbut I also loved the arts and sciences.
p160
aVYou see, when I was growing up as
p161
aVa little girl and as a teenager,
p162
aVI loved designing and making dogs' clothes
p163
aVand wanting to be a fashion designer.
p164
aVI took art and ceramics. I loved dance.
p165
aVLola Falana. Alvin Ailey. Jerome Robbins.
p166
aVAnd I also avidly followed the Gemini
p167
aVand the Apollo programs.
p168
aVI had science projects and tons of astronomy
p169
aVbooks. I took calculus and philosophy.
p170
aVI wondered about the infinity
p171
aVand the Big Bang theory.
p172
aVAnd when I was at Stanford,
p173
aVI found myself, my senior year,
p174
aVchemical engineering major, half the folks
p175
aVthought I was a political science and
p176
aVperforming arts major, which was sort of
p177
aVtrue because I was Black Student Union President
p178
aVand I did major in some other things,
p179
aVand I found myself the last quarter juggling
p180
aVchemical engineering separation processes,
p181
aVlogic classes, nuclear magnetic resonance
p182
aVspectroscopy, and also producing
p183
aVand choreographing a dance production,
p184
aVand I had to do the lighting and the
p185
aVdesign work, and I was trying to figure out,
p186
aVdo I go to New York City
p187
aVto try to become a professional dancer,
p188
aVor do I go to medical school?
p189
aVNow, my mother helped me figure
p190
aVthat one out. (Laughter)
p191
aVBut when I went into space,
p192
aVwhen I went into space I carried a number
p193
aVof things up with me. I carried a poster
p194
aVby Alvin Ailey, which you can figure out
p195
aVnow, I love the dance company.
p196
aVAn Alvin Ailey poster of Judith Jamison
p197
aVperforming the dance "Cry," dedicated to all
p198
aVblack women everywhere. A Bundu statue,
p199
aVwhich was from the Women's Society
p200
aVin Sierra Leone, and a certificate for the
p201
aVChicago Public School students to work to
p202
aVimprove their science and math,
p203
aVand folks asked me,
p204
aV"Why did you take up what you took up?"
p205
aVAnd I had to say,
p206
aV"Because it represents human creativity,
p207
aVthe creativity that allowed us, that we were
p208
aVrequired to have to conceive and build
p209
aVand launch the space shuttle, springs from
p210
aVthe same source as the imagination and
p211
aVanalysis it took to carve a Bundu statue,
p212
aVor the ingenuity it took to design,
p213
aVchoreograph, and stage "Cry."
p214
aVEach one of them are different
p215
aVmanifestations, incarnations, of creativity,
p216
aVavatars of human creativity,
p217
aVand that's what we have to reconcile
p218
aVin our minds, how these things fit together.
p219
aVThe difference between arts and sciences
p220
aVis not analytical versus intuitive, right?
p221
aVE=MC squared required
p222
aVan intuitive leap, and then you had
p223
aVto do the analysis afterwards.
p224
aVEinstein said, in fact, "The most beautiful
p225
aVthing we can experience is the mysterious.
p226
aVIt is the source of all true art and science."
p227
aVDance requires us to express and want
p228
aVto express the jubilation in life, but then you
p229
aVhave to figure out, exactly
p230
aVwhat movement do I do to make sure
p231
aVthat it comes across correctly?
p232
aVThe difference between arts and sciences
p233
aVis also not constructive versus
p234
aVdeconstructive, right? A lot of people
p235
aVthink of the sciences as deconstructive.
p236
aVYou have to pull things apart.
p237
aVAnd yeah, sub-atomic physics
p238
aVis deconstructive. You literally try to
p239
aVtear atoms apart to understand
p240
aVwhat's inside of them. But sculpture, from
p241
aVwhat I understand from great sculptors,
p242
aVis deconstructive, because you see a piece
p243
aVand you remove what doesn't
p244
aVneed to be there.
p245
aVBiotechnology is constructive.
p246
aVOrchestral arranging is constructive.
p247
aVSo in fact we use constructive and
p248
aVdeconstructive techniques in everything.
p249
aVThe difference between science
p250
aVand the arts is not that they
p251
aVare different sides of the same coin, even,
p252
aVor even different parts
p253
aVof the same continuum, but rather
p254
aVthey're manifestations of the same thing.
p255
aVDifferent quantum states of an atom?
p256
aVOr maybe if I want to be more 21st century
p257
aVI could say that they are different harmonic
p258
aVresonances of a superstring.
p259
aVBut we'll leave that alone. (Laughter)
p260
aVThey spring from the same source.
p261
aVThe arts and sciences are avatars of
p262
aVhuman creativity. It's our attempt
p263
aVas humans to build an understanding
p264
aVof the universe, the world around us.
p265
aVIt's our attempt to influence things,
p266
aVthe universe internal to ourselves
p267
aVand external to us.
p268
aVThe sciences, to me, are manifestations
p269
aVof our attempt to express
p270
aVor share our understanding,
p271
aVour experience, to influence the universe
p272
aVexternal to ourselves.
p273
aVIt doesn't rely on us as individuals.
p274
aVIt's the universe, as experienced
p275
aVby everyone, and the arts manifest
p276
aVour desire, our attempt to share
p277
aVor influence others through experiences
p278
aVthat are peculiar to us as individuals.
p279
aVLet me say it again another way:
p280
aVscience provides an understanding
p281
aVof a universal experience, and
p282
aVarts provides a universal understanding
p283
aVof a personal experience.
p284
aVThat's what we have to think about,
p285
aVthat they're all part of us, they're
p286
aVall part of a continuum.
p287
aVIt's not just the tools, it's not just
p288
aVthe sciences, you know, the mathematics
p289
aVand the numerical stuff and the statistics,
p290
aVbecause we heard, very much on this
p291
aVstage, people talked about music
p292
aVbeing mathematical. Right? Arts don't just
p293
aVuse clay, aren't the only ones that use clay,
p294
aVlight and sound and movement.
p295
aVThey use analysis as well.
p296
aVSo people might say, well,
p297
aVI still like that intuitive versus analytical
p298
aVthing, because everybody wants to do the
p299
aVright brain, left brain thing, right?
p300
aVWe've all been accused of being
p301
aVright-brained or left-brained at some point
p302
aVin time, depending on who
p303
aVwe disagreed with. (Laughter)
p304
aVYou know, people say intuitive, you know
p305
aVthat's like you're in touch with nature,
p306
aVin touch with yourself and relationships.
p307
aVAnalytical: you put your mind to work, and
p308
aVI'm going to tell you a little secret. You all
p309
aVknow this though, but sometimes people
p310
aVuse this analysis idea, that things are
p311
aVoutside of ourselves, to be, say, that this
p312
aVis what we're going to elevate
p313
aVas the true, most important sciences, right?
p314
aVAnd then you have artists, and you all
p315
aVknow this is true as well,
p316
aVartists will say things about scientists
p317
aVbecause they say they're too concrete,
p318
aVthey're disconnected with the world.
p319
aVBut, we've even had that here on stage,
p320
aVso don't act like you don't know
p321
aVwhat I'm talking about. (Laughter)
p322
aVWe had folks talking about the Flat Earth
p323
aVSociety and flower arrangers, so there's
p324
aVthis whole dichotomy that we continue
p325
aVto carry along, even when we know better.
p326
aVAnd folks say we need to choose either or.
p327
aVBut it would really be foolish to choose
p328
aVeither one, right?
p329
aVIntuitive versus analytical?
p330
aVThat's a foolish choice. It's foolish,
p331
aVjust like trying to choose between
p332
aVbeing realistic or idealistic.
p333
aVYou need both in life. Why do people
p334
aVdo this? I'm just gonna quote
p335
aVa molecular biologist, Sydney Brenner,
p336
aVwho's 70 years old so he can say this. He said,
p337
aV"It's always important to distinguish
p338
aVbetween chastity and impotence."
p339
aVNow... (Laughter)
p340
aVI want to share with you
p341
aVa little equation, okay?
p342
aVHow do understanding science
p343
aVand the arts fit into our lives
p344
aVand what's going on and the things
p345
aVthat we're talking about here
p346
aVat the design conference, and this is
p347
aVa little thing I came up with, understanding
p348
aVand our resources and our will
p349
aVcause us to have outcomes.
p350
aVOur understanding is our science, our arts,
p351
aVour religion, how we see the universe
p352
aVaround us, our resources, our money,
p353
aVour labor, our minerals, those things
p354
aVthat are out there in the world we have
p355
aVto work with.
p356
aVBut more importantly, there's our will.
p357
aVThis is our vision, our aspirations
p358
aVof the future, our hopes, our dreams,
p359
aVour struggles and our fears.
p360
aVOur successes and our failures influence
p361
aVwhat we do with all of those, and to me,
p362
aVdesign and engineering, craftsmanship and
p363
aVskilled labor, are all the things that work on
p364
aVthis to have our outcome,
p365
aVwhich is our human quality of life.
p366
aVWhere do we want the world to be?
p367
aVAnd guess what?
p368
aVRegardless of how we look at this, whether
p369
aVwe look at arts and sciences are separate
p370
aVor different, they're both being influenced
p371
aVnow and they're both having problems.
p372
aVI did a project called S.E.E.ing the Future:
p373
aVScience, Engineering and Education, and
p374
aVit was looking at how to shed light on
p375
aVmost effective use of government funding.
p376
aVWe got a bunch of scientists in all stages
p377
aVof their careers. They came to Dartmouth
p378
aVCollege, where I was teaching, and they
p379
aVtalked about with theologians and financiers,
p380
aVwhat are some of the issues of public
p381
aVfunding for science and engineering
p382
aVresearch? What's most important about it?
p383
aVThere are some ideas that emerged that
p384
aVI think have really powerful parallels
p385
aVto the arts. The first thing they said was that
p386
aVthe circumstances that we find ourselves in
p387
aVtoday in the sciences and engineering that
p388
aVmade us world leaders is very different
p389
aVthan the '40s, the '50s, and the '60s
p390
aVand the '70s when we emerged
p391
aVas world leaders, because we're no longer
p392
aVin competition with fascism, with
p393
aVSoviet-style communism, and by the way
p394
aVthat competition wasn't just military,
p395
aVit included social competition
p396
aVand political competition as well,
p397
aVthat allowed us to look at space
p398
aVas one of those platforms to prove
p399
aVthat our social system was better.
p400
aVAnother thing they talked about was the
p401
aVinfrastructure that supports the sciences
p402
aVis becoming obsolete. We look at
p403
aVuniversities and colleges, small, mid-sized
p404
aVcommunity colleges across the country,
p405
aVtheir laboratories are becoming obsolete,
p406
aVand this is where we train most of our
p407
aVscience workers and our researchers,
p408
aVand our teachers, by the way,
p409
aVand then that there's a media that doesn't
p410
aVsupport the dissemination of any more than
p411
aVthe most mundane and inane of information.
p412
aVThere's pseudo-science, crop circles,
p413
aValien autopsy, haunted houses,
p414
aVor disasters. And that's what we see.
p415
aVAnd this isn't really the information
p416
aVyou need to operate in everyday life
p417
aVand figure out how to participate in this
p418
aVdemocracy and determine what's going on.
p419
aVThey also said that there's a change
p420
aVin the corporate mentality. Whereas
p421
aVgovernment money had always been there
p422
aVfor basic science and engineering research,
p423
aVwe also counted on some companies to do
p424
aVsome basic research, but what's happened
p425
aVnow is companies put more energy into
p426
aVshort-term product development
p427
aVthan they do in basic engineering
p428
aVand science research.
p429
aVAnd education is not keeping up.
p430
aVIn K through 12, people are taking out
p431
aVwet labs. They think if we put a computer
p432
aVin the room it's going to take the place
p433
aVof actually, we're mixing the acids,
p434
aVwe're growing the potatoes.
p435
aVAnd government funding is decreasing
p436
aVin spending and then they're saying,
p437
aVlet's have corporations take over,
p438
aVand that's not true. Government funding
p439
aVshould at least do things like recognize
p440
aVcost-benefits of basic science and
p441
aVengineering research. We have to know
p442
aVthat we have a responsibility
p443
aVas global citizens in this world.
p444
aVWe have to look at the education
p445
aVof humans. We need to build our resources
p446
aVtoday to make sure that they're trained so
p447
aVthat they understand the importance of
p448
aVthese things, and we have to support
p449
aVthe vitality of science, and that doesn't
p450
aVmean that everything has to have one thing
p451
aVthat's going to go on, or we know
p452
aVexactly what's going to be the outcome of it,
p453
aVbut that we support the vitality and the
p454
aVintellectual curiosity that goes along,
p455
aVand if you think about those parallels
p456
aVto the arts, the competition
p457
aVwith the Bolshoi Ballet spurred
p458
aVthe Joffrey and the New York City Ballet
p459
aVto become better.
p460
aVInfrastructure museums, theaters,
p461
aVmovie houses across the country
p462
aVare disappearing. We have more
p463
aVtelevision stations with less to watch,
p464
aVwe have more money spent on
p465
aVrewrites to get old television programs
p466
aVin the movies.
p467
aVWe have corporate funding now that,
p468
aVwhen it goes to some company, when it
p469
aVgoes to support the arts, it almost requires
p470
aVthat the product be part of the picture
p471
aVthat the artist draws, and we have
p472
aVstadiums that are named over and over
p473
aVagain by corporations.
p474
aVIn Houston, we're trying to figure out
p475
aVwhat to do with that Enron Stadium thing.
p476
aV(Laughter) And fine arts and education
p477
aVin the schools is disappearing, and we have
p478
aVa government that seems like it's gutting
p479
aVthe NEA and other programs,
p480
aVso we have to really stop and think,
p481
aVwhat are we trying to do
p482
aVwith the sciences and the arts?
p483
aVThere's a need to revitalize them.
p484
aVWe have to pay attention to it. I just want
p485
aVto tell you really quickly what I'm doing.
p486
aV(Applause)
p487
aVI want to tell you what I've been doing
p488
aVa little bit since... I feel this need
p489
aVto sort of integrate some of the ideas
p490
aVthat I've had and run across over time.
p491
aVOne of the things that I found out
p492
aVis that there's a need to repair
p493
aVthe dichotomy between the mind and body
p494
aVas well. My mother always told me,
p495
aVyou have to be observant, know what's
p496
aVgoing on in your mind and your body,
p497
aVand as a dancer I had this tremendous
p498
aVfaith in my ability to know my body,
p499
aVjust as I knew how to sense colors.
p500
aVThen I went to medical school, and I was
p501
aVsupposed to just go on
p502
aVwhat the machine said about bodies.
p503
aVYou know, you would ask patients
p504
aVquestions and some people would tell you,
p505
aV"Don't, don't, don't listen to what
p506
aVthe patients said." We know that patients
p507
aVknow and understand their bodies better,
p508
aVbut these days we're trying to divorce them
p509
aVfrom that idea. We have to reconcile the
p510
aVpatient's knowledge of their body
p511
aVwith physician's measurements.
p512
aVWe had someone talk about
p513
aVmeasuring emotions and getting machines
p514
aVto figure out what, to keep us
p515
aVfrom acting crazy. Right?
p516
aVNo, we shouldn't measure,
p517
aVwe shouldn't use machines
p518
aVto measure road rage and then do
p519
aVsomething to keep us from engaging in it.
p520
aVMaybe we can have machines help us
p521
aVto recognize that we have road rage and
p522
aVthen we need to know how to control that
p523
aVwithout the machines. We even need to be
p524
aVable to recognize that without the machines.
p525
aVWhat I'm very concerned about
p526
aVis how do we bolster our self-awareness
p527
aVas humans, as biological organisms?
p528
aVMichael Moschen spoke of having to teach
p529
aVand learn how to feel with my eyes,
p530
aVto see with my hands.
p531
aVWe have all kinds of possibilities to use
p532
aVour senses by, and that's
p533
aVwhat we have to do.
p534
aVThat's what I want to do, is to try to use
p535
aVbioinstrumentation, those kind of things
p536
aVto help our senses in what we do,
p537
aVand that's the work I've been doing now as
p538
aVa company called BioSentient Corporation.
p539
aVI figured I'd have to do that ad, because
p540
aVI'm an entrepreneur, because entrepreneur
p541
aVsays that that's somebody who does what
p542
aVthey want to do because they're not broke
p543
aVenough that they have to get a real job.
p544
aV(Laughter) But that's the work I'm doing
p545
aVwith BioSentient Corporation trying to figure
p546
aVout how do we integrate these things?
p547
aVLet me finish by saying that
p548
aVmy personal design issue for the future
p549
aVis really about integrating, to think about
p550
aVthat intuitive and that analytical.
p551
aVThe arts and sciences are not separate.
p552
aVHigh school physics lesson before you
p553
aVleave. High school physics teacher used to
p554
aVhold up a ball. She would say this ball
p555
aVhas potential energy, but nothing
p556
aVwill happen to it, it can't do any work
p557
aVuntil I drop it and it changes states.
p558
aVI like to think of ideas as potential energy.
p559
aVThey're really wonderful, but nothing
p560
aVwill happen until we risk
p561
aVputting them into action.
p562
aVThis conference is filled
p563
aVwith wonderful ideas.
p564
aVWe're going to share lots of things
p565
aVwith people, but nothing's going to happen
p566
aVuntil we risk putting those ideas into action.
p567
aVWe need to revitalize the arts and sciences
p568
aVof today, we need to take responsibility
p569
aVfor the future. We can't hide behind saying
p570
aVit's just for company profits,
p571
aVor it's just a business, or I'm an artist
p572
aVor an academician.
p573
aVHere's how you judge what you're doing.
p574
aVI talked about that balance between
p575
aVintuitive, analytical.
p576
aVFran Lebowitz, my favorite cynic,
p577
aVshe said the three questions
p578
aVof greatest concern, now I'm going to
p579
aVadd on to design, is,
p580
aV"Is it attractive?"
p581
aVThat's the intuitive.
p582
aV"Is it amusing?" The analytical.
p583
aV"And does it know its place?"
p584
aVThe balance. Thank you very much.
p585

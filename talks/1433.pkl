VWe conventionally divide space
p5
aVinto private and public realms,
p6
aVand we know these legal distinctions very well
p7
aVbecause we've become experts
p8
aVat protecting our private property and private space.
p9
aVBut we're less attuned
p10
aVto the nuances of the public.
p11
aVWhat translates generic public space into qualitative space?
p12
aVI mean, this is something
p13
aVthat our studio has been working on
p14
aVfor the past decade.
p15
aVAnd we're doing this through some case studies.
p16
aa(lp17
VA large chunk of our work
p18
aVhas been put into transforming
p19
aVthis neglected industrial ruin
p20
aVinto a viable post-industrial space
p21
aVthat looks forward and backward
p22
aVat the same time.
p23
aVAnd another huge chunk of our work
p24
aVhas gone into making relevant
p25
aVa site that's grown out of sync with its time.
p26
aVWe've been working on democratizing Lincoln Center
p27
aVfor a public that doesn't usually have $300
p28
aVto spend on an opera ticket.
p29
aVSo we've been eating, drinking,
p30
aVthinking, living public space
p31
aVfor quite a long time.
p32
aVAnd it's taught us really one thing,
p33
aVand that is to truly make good public space,
p34
aVyou have to erase the distinctions
p35
aVbetween architecture, urbanism,
p36
aVlandscape, media design
p37
aVand so on.
p38
aVIt really goes beyond distinction.
p39
aa(lp40
VNow we're moving onto Washington, D.C.
p41
aVand we're working on another transformation,
p42
aVand that is for the existing Hirshhorn Museum
p43
aVthat's sited
p44
aVon the most revered public space in America,
p45
aVthe National Mall.
p46
aVThe Mall is a symbol
p47
aVof American democracy.
p48
aVAnd what's fantastic is that this symbol
p49
aVis not a thing, it's not an image,
p50
aVit's not an artifact,
p51
aVactually it's a space,
p52
aVand it's kind of just defined by a line of buildings
p53
aVon either side.
p54
aa(lp55
VIt's a space where citizens can voice their discontent
p56
aVand show their power.
p57
aVIt's a place where pivotal moments in American history
p58
aVhave taken place.
p59
aVAnd they're inscribed in there forever \u2014
p60
aVlike the march on Washington for jobs and freedom
p61
aVand the great speech that Martin Luther King gave there.
p62
aVThe Vietnam protests, the commemoration of all that died
p63
aVin the pandemic of AIDS,
p64
aVthe march for women's reproductive rights,
p65
aVright up until almost the present.
p66
aVThe Mall is the greatest civic stage
p67
aVin this country for dissent.
p68
aVAnd it's synonymous with free speech,
p69
aVeven if you're not sure what it is that you have to say.
p70
aVIt may just be a place for civic commiseration.
p71
aa(lp72
VThere is a huge disconnect, we believe,
p73
aVbetween the communicative and discursive space of the Mall
p74
aVand the museums that line it to either side.
p75
aVAnd that is that those museums are usually passive,
p76
aVthey have passive relationships between the museum
p77
aVas the presenter and the audience,
p78
aVas the receiver of information.
p79
aVAnd so you can see dinosaurs
p80
aVand insects and collections of locomotives
p81
aVand all of that,
p82
aVbut you're really not involved;
p83
aVyou're being talked to.
p84
aa(lp85
VWhen Richard Koshalek took over as director of the Hirshhorn
p86
aVin 2009,
p87
aVhe was determined to take advantage
p88
aVof the fact that this museum was sited
p89
aVat the most unique place:
p90
aVat the seat of power in the U.S.
p91
aVAnd while art and politics
p92
aVare inherently and implicitly together always and all the time,
p93
aVthere could be some very special relationship
p94
aVthat could be forged here in its uniqueness.
p95
aa(lp96
VThe question is, is it possible ultimately
p97
aVfor art to insert itself
p98
aVinto the dialogue of national and world affairs?
p99
aVAnd could the museum be an agent of cultural diplomacy?
p100
aVThere are over 180 embassies in Washington D.C.
p101
aVThere are over 500 think tanks.
p102
aVThere should be a way
p103
aVof harnessing all of that intellectual and global energy
p104
aVinto, and somehow through, the museum.
p105
aVThere should be some kind of brain trust.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo the Hirshhorn, as we began to think about it,
p108
aVand as we evolved the mission,
p109
aVwith Richard and his team \u2014
p110
aVit's really his life blood.
p111
aVBut beyond exhibiting contemporary art,
p112
aVthe Hirshhorn will become a public forum,
p113
aVa place of discourse
p114
aVfor issues around arts,
p115
aVculture, politics and policy.
p116
aVIt would have the global reach of the World Economic Forum.
p117
aVIt would have the interdisciplinarity of the TED Conference.
p118
aVIt would have the informality of the town square.
p119
aVAnd for this new initiative,
p120
aVthe Hirshhorn would have to expand
p121
aVor appropriate a site
p122
aVfor a contemporary, deployable structure.
p123
aa(lp124
VThis is it. This is the Hirshhorn \u2014
p125
aVso a 230-foot-diameter concrete doughnut
p126
aVdesigned in the early '70s
p127
aVby Gordon Bunshaft.
p128
aVIt's hulking, it's silent,
p129
aVit's cloistered, it's arrogant,
p130
aVit's a design challenge.
p131
aVArchitects love to hate it.
p132
aVOne redeeming feature
p133
aVis it's lifted up off the ground
p134
aVand it's got this void,
p135
aVand it's got an empty core
p136
aVkind of in the spirit and that facade
p137
aVvery much corporate and federal style.
p138
aa(lp139
VAnd around that space,
p140
aVthe ring is actually galleries.
p141
aVVery, very difficult to mount shows in there.
p142
aVWhen the Hirshhorn opened,
p143
aVAda Louise Huxstable, the New York Times critic,
p144
aVhad some choice words:
p145
aV"Neo-penitentiary modern."
p146
aV"A maimed monument and a maimed Mall
p147
aVfor a maimed collection."
p148
aa(lp149
VAlmost four decades later,
p150
aVhow will this building expand
p151
aVfor a new progressive program?
p152
aVWhere would it go?
p153
aVIt can't go in the Mall.
p154
aVThere is no space there.
p155
aVIt can't go in the courtyard.
p156
aVIt's already taken up by landscape and by sculptures.
p157
aVWell there's always the hole.
p158
aVBut how could it take the space of that hole
p159
aVand not be buried in it invisibly?
p160
aVHow could it become iconic?
p161
aVAnd what language would it take?
p162
aa(lp163
VThe Hirshhorn sits among the Mall's monumental institutions.
p164
aVMost are neoclassical, heavy and opaque,
p165
aVmade of stone or concrete.
p166
aVAnd the question is,
p167
aVif one inhabits that space,
p168
aVwhat is the material of the Mall?
p169
aVIt has to be different from the buildings there.
p170
aVIt has to be something entirely different.
p171
aVIt has to be air.
p172
aVIn our imagination, it has to be light.
p173
aVIt has to be ephemeral. It has to be formless.
p174
aVAnd it has to be free.
p175
aa(lp176
V(Video)
p177
aa(lp178
VSo this is the big idea.
p179
aVIt's a giant airbag.
p180
aVThe expansion takes the shape of its container
p181
aVand it oozes out wherever it can \u2014
p182
aVthe top and sides.
p183
aVBut more poetically,
p184
aVwe like to think of the structure
p185
aVas inhaling the democratic air of the Mall,
p186
aVbringing it into itself.
p187
aVThe before and the after.
p188
aa(lp189
VIt was dubbed "the bubble" by the press.
p190
aVThat was the lounge.
p191
aVIt's basically one big volume of air
p192
aVthat just oozes out in every direction.
p193
aVThe membrane is translucent.
p194
aVIt's made of silcon-coated glass fiber.
p195
aVAnd it's inflated twice a year for one month at a time.
p196
aa(lp197
VThis is the view from the inside.
p198
aVSo you might have been wondering
p199
aVhow in the world
p200
aVdid we get this approved by the federal government.
p201
aVIt had to be approved by actually two agencies.
p202
aVAnd one is there to preserve
p203
aVthe dignity and sanctity of the Mall.
p204
aVI blush whenever I show this.
p205
aVIt is yours to interpret.
p206
aa(lp207
VBut one thing I can say
p208
aVis that it's a combination
p209
aVof iconoclasm
p210
aVand adoration.
p211
aVThere was also some creative interpretation involved.
p212
aVThe Congressional Buildings Act of 1910
p213
aVlimits the height of buildings in D.C.
p214
aVto 130 feet,
p215
aVexcept for spires, towers, domes and minarets.
p216
aVThis pretty much exempts monuments of the church and state.
p217
aVAnd the bubble is 153 ft.
p218
aVThat's the Pantheon next to it.
p219
aVIt's about 1.2 million cubic feet of compressed air.
p220
aVAnd so we argued it
p221
aVon the merits of being a dome.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo there it is,
p224
aVvery stately,
p225
aVamong all the stately buildings in the Mall.
p226
aVAnd while this Hirshhorn is not landmarked,
p227
aVit's very, very historically sensitive.
p228
aVAnd so we couldn't really touch its surfaces.
p229
aVWe couldn't leave any traces behind.
p230
aVSo we strained it from the edges,
p231
aVand we held it by cables.
p232
aVIt's a study of some bondage techniques,
p233
aVwhich are actually very important
p234
aVbecause it's hit by wind all the time.
p235
aVThere's one permanent steel ring at the top,
p236
aVbut it can't be seen from any vantage point on the Mall.
p237
aa(lp238
VThere are also some restrictions
p239
aVabout how much it could be lit.
p240
aVIt glows from within, it's translucent.
p241
aVBut it can't be more lit than the Capitol
p242
aVor some of the monuments.
p243
aVSo it's down the hierarchy on lighting.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo it comes to the site twice a year.
p246
aVIt's taken off the delivery truck.
p247
aVIt's hoisted.
p248
aVAnd then it's inflated
p249
aVwith this low-pressure air.
p250
aVAnd then it's restrained with the cables.
p251
aVAnd then it's ballasted with water at the very bottom.
p252
aa(lp253
VThis is a very strange moment
p254
aVwhere we were asked by the bureaucracy at the Mall
p255
aVhow much time would it take to install.
p256
aVAnd we said, well the first erection would take one week.
p257
aVAnd they really connected with that idea.
p258
aVAnd then it was really easy all the way through.
p259
aVSo we didn't really have that many hurdles, I have to say,
p260
aVwith the government and all the authorities.
p261
aa(lp262
VBut some of the toughest hurdles
p263
aVhave been the technical ones.
p264
aVThis is the warp and weft.
p265
aVThis is a point cloud.
p266
aVThere are extreme pressures.
p267
aVThis is a very, very unusual building
p268
aVin that there's no gravity load,
p269
aVbut there's load in every direction.
p270
aa(lp271
VAnd I'm just going to zip through these slides.
p272
aVAnd this is the space in action.
p273
aVSo flexible interior for discussions,
p274
aVjust like this, but in the round \u2014
p275
aVluminous and reconfigurable.
p276
aVCould be used for anything,
p277
aVfor performances, films,
p278
aVfor installations.
p279
aVAnd the very first program
p280
aVwill be one of cultural dialogue and diplomacy
p281
aVorganized in partnership
p282
aVwith the Council on Foreign Relations.
p283
aa(lp284
VForm and content are together here.
p285
aVThe bubble is an anti-monument.
p286
aVThe ideals of participatory democracy
p287
aVare represented through suppleness
p288
aVrather than rigidity.
p289
aa(lp290
VArt and politics
p291
aVoccupy an ambiguous site outside the museum walls,
p292
aVbut inside of the museum's core,
p293
aVblending its air
p294
aVwith the democratic air of the Mall.
p295
aVAnd the bubble will inflate
p296
aVhopefully for the first time
p297
aVat the end of 2013.
p298
aa(lp299
VThank you.

VLast year here at TED
p5
aVI asked you to give me your data,
p6
aVto put your data on the web, on the basis
p7
aVthat if people put data onto the web \u2014
p8
aVgovernment data, scientific data, community data,
p9
aVwhatever it is \u2014 it will be used by other people
p10
aVto do wonderful things, in ways
p11
aVthat they never could have imagined.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo, today I'm back just to show you a few things,
p14
aVto show you, in fact, there is
p15
aVan open data movement afoot,
p16
aVnow, around the world.
p17
aVThe cry of "Raw data now!"
p18
aVwhich I made people make in the auditorium,
p19
aVwas heard around the world.
p20
aVSo, let's roll the video.
p21
aa(lp22
VA classic story, the first one which lots of people picked up,
p23
aVwas when in March \u2014 on March 10th in fact, soon after TED \u2014
p24
aVPaul Clarke, in the U.K. government,
p25
aVblogged, "Oh, I've just got some raw data. Here it is,
p26
aVit's about bicycle accidents."
p27
aVTwo days it took the Times Online
p28
aVto make a map, a mashable map \u2014
p29
aVwe call these things mash-ups \u2014
p30
aVa mashed-up user interface that allows you to go in there
p31
aVand have a look and find out whether your bicycle
p32
aVroute to work was affected.
p33
aa(lp34
VHere's more data, traffic survey data,
p35
aVagain, put out by the U.K. government,
p36
aVand because they put it up using the Linked Data standards,
p37
aVthen a user could just make a map,
p38
aVjust by clicking.
p39
aa(lp40
VDoes this data affect things? Well, let's get back to 2008.
p41
aVLook at Zanesville, Ohio.
p42
aVHere's a map a lawyer made. He put on it the water plant,
p43
aVand which houses are there,
p44
aVwhich houses have been connected to the water.
p45
aVAnd he got, from other data sources,
p46
aVinformation to show
p47
aVwhich houses are occupied by white people.
p48
aVWell, there was too much of a correlation, he felt,
p49
aVbetween which houses were occupied by white people
p50
aVand which houses had water, and the judge was not impressed either.
p51
aVThe judge was not impressed to the tune of 10.9 million dollars.
p52
aVThat's the power of taking one piece of data,
p53
aVanother piece of data, putting it together,
p54
aVand showing the result.
p55
aa(lp56
VLet's look at some data from the U.K. now.
p57
aVThis is U.K. government data, a completely independent site,
p58
aVWhere Does My Money Go.
p59
aVIt allows anybody to go there and burrow down.
p60
aVYou can burrow down by a particular type of spending,
p61
aVor you can go through all the different regions and compare them.
p62
aVSo, that's happening in the U.K. with U.K. government data.
p63
aa(lp64
VYes, certainly you can do it over here.
p65
aVHere's a site which allows you to look at recovery spending
p66
aVin California.
p67
aVTake an arbitrary example, Long Beach, California,
p68
aVyou can go and have a look at what recovery money they've been spending
p69
aVon different things such as energy.
p70
aa(lp71
VIn fact, this is the graph of the number of data sets
p72
aVin the repositories of data.gov,
p73
aVand data.gov.uk.
p74
aVAnd I'm delighted to see a great competition
p75
aVbetween the U.K. in blue, and the U.S. in red.
p76
aa(lp77
VHow can you use this stuff?
p78
aVWell, for example, if you have lots of data about places
p79
aVyou can take, from a postcode \u2014
p80
aVwhich is like a zip plus four \u2014
p81
aVfor a specific group of houses, you can make paper,
p82
aVprint off a paper which has got very, very
p83
aVspecific things about the bus stops,
p84
aVthe things specifically near you.
p85
aa(lp86
VOn a larger scale, this is a mash-up
p87
aVof the data which was released about the Afghan elections.
p88
aVIt allows you to set your own criteria
p89
aVfor what sort of things you want to look at.
p90
aVThe red circles are polling stations,
p91
aVselected by your criteria.
p92
aVAnd then you can select also other things on the map
p93
aVto see what other factors, like the threat level.
p94
aVSo, that was government data.
p95
aa(lp96
VI also talked about community-generated data \u2014 in fact I edited some.
p97
aVThis is the wiki map, this is the Open Street Map.
p98
aV"Terrace Theater" I actually put
p99
aVon the map because it wasn't on the map before TED last year.
p100
aVI was not the only person editing the open street map.
p101
aVEach flash on this visualization \u2014
p102
aVput together by ITO World \u2014
p103
aVshows an edit in 2009
p104
aVmade to the Open Street Map.
p105
aVLet's now spin the world during the same year.
p106
aVEvery flash is an edit. Somebody somewhere
p107
aVlooking at the Open Street Map, and realizing it could be better.
p108
aVYou can see Europe is ablaze with updates.
p109
aVSome places, perhaps not as much as they should be.
p110
aa(lp111
VHere focusing in on Haiti.
p112
aVThe map of Port au-Prince at the end
p113
aVof 2009 was not all it could be,
p114
aVnot as good as the map of California.
p115
aVFortunately, just after the earthquake,
p116
aVGeoEye, a commercial company,
p117
aVreleased satellite imagery
p118
aVwith a license, which allowed
p119
aVthe open-source community to use it.
p120
aVThis is January, in time lapse,
p121
aVof people editing ... that's the earthquake.
p122
aVAfter the earthquake, immediately,
p123
aVpeople all over the world, mappers
p124
aVwho wanted to help, and could,
p125
aVlooked at that imagery, built the map, quickly building it up.
p126
aa(lp127
VWe're focusing now on Port-au-Prince.
p128
aVThe light blue is refugee camps these volunteers had spotted from the [satellite images].
p129
aVSo, now we have, immediately, a real-time map
p130
aVshowing where there are refugee camps \u2014
p131
aVrapidly became the best map
p132
aVto use if you're doing relief work in Port-au-Prince.
p133
aVWitness the fact that it's here on this Garmin device
p134
aVbeing used by rescue team in Haiti.
p135
aa(lp136
VThere's the map showing,
p137
aVon the left-hand side,
p138
aVthat hospital \u2014 actually that's a hospital ship.
p139
aVThis is a real-time map that shows blocked roads,
p140
aVdamaged buildings, refugee camps \u2014
p141
aVit shows things that are needed [for rescue and relief work].
p142
aa(lp143
VSo, if you've been involved in that at all,
p144
aVI just wanted to say: Whatever you've been doing,
p145
aVwhether you've just been chanting, "Raw data now!"
p146
aVor you've been putting government or scientific data online,
p147
aVI just wanted to take this opportunity to say: Thank you very much,
p148
aVand we have only just started!

VOne of my favorite words in the whole of the Oxford English Dictionary
p5
aVis "snollygoster,"
p6
aVjust because it sounds so good.
p7
aVAnd what snollygoster means is "a dishonest politician."
p8
aVAlthough there was a 19th-century newspaper editor
p9
aVwho defined it rather better when he said,
p10
aV"A snollygoster is a fellow who seeks office
p11
aVregardless of party, platform or principle,
p12
aVand who, when he wins,
p13
aVgets there by the sheer force of monumental talknophical assumnancy."
p14
aa(lp15
V(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VNow, I have no idea what "talknophical" is.
p18
aVSomething to do with words, I assume.
p19
aVBut it's very important that words are at the center of politics,
p20
aVand all politicians know they have to try and control language.
p21
aa(lp22
VIt wasn't until, for example, 1771
p23
aVthat the British Parliament allowed newspapers to report
p24
aVthe exact words that were said in the debating chamber.
p25
aVAnd this was actually all down to the bravery
p26
aVof a guy with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby,
p27
aVwho took on Parliament.
p28
aVAnd he was thrown into the Tower of London
p29
aVand imprisoned,
p30
aVbut he was brave enough,
p31
aVhe was brave enough to take them on, and in the end,
p32
aVhe had such popular support in London that he won.
p33
aVAnd it was only a few years later
p34
aVthat we have the first recorded use of the phrase "as bold as brass."
p35
aVMost people think that's down to the metal.
p36
aVIt's not; it's down to a campaigner for the freedom of the press.
p37
aa(lp38
VBut to really show you how words and politics interact,
p39
aVI want to take you back to the United States of America,
p40
aVjust after they'd achieved independence.
p41
aVAnd they had to face the question
p42
aVof what to call George Washington, their leader.
p43
aVThey didn't know.
p44
aVWhat do you call the leader of a republican country?
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd this was debated in Congress for ages and ages.
p47
aVAnd there were all sorts of suggestions on the table,
p48
aVwhich might have made it.
p49
aVI mean, some people wanted him to be called
p50
aV"Chief Magistrate Washington,"
p51
aVand other people, "His Highness, George Washington,"
p52
aVand other people,
p53
aV"Protector of the Liberties
p54
aVof the People of the United States of America Washington."
p55
aVNot that catchy.
p56
aVSome people just wanted to call him king \u2014
p57
aVit was tried and tested.
p58
aVThey weren't even being monarchical,
p59
aVthey had the idea that you could be elected king for a fixed term.
p60
aVAnd, you know, it could have worked.
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd everybody got insanely bored,
p63
aVbecause this debate went on for three weeks.
p64
aVI read a diary of this poor senator who just keeps coming back,
p65
aV"Still on this subject."
p66
aVAnd the reason for the delay and the boredom
p67
aVwas that the House of Representatives were against the Senate.
p68
aVThe House of Representatives didn't want Washington to get drunk on power.
p69
aVThey didn't want to call him "king," in case that gave him ideas,
p70
aVor his successor ideas.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo they wanted to give him the humblest, meagerest,
p73
aVmost pathetic title that they could think of.
p74
aVAnd that title ...
p75
aVwas "President."
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
V"President." They didn't invent the title.
p80
aVI mean, it existed before,
p81
aVbut it just meant somebody who presides over a meeting.
p82
aVIt was like the foreman of the jury.
p83
aVAnd it didn't have much more grandeur
p84
aVthan the term "foreman" or "overseer."
p85
aVThere were occasional presidents of little colonial councils
p86
aVand bits of government,
p87
aVbut it was really a nothing title.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd that's why the Senate objected to it.
p90
aVThey said, "That's ridiculous! You can't call him 'President.'
p91
aVThis guy has to go and sign treaties and meet foreign dignitaries.
p92
aVWho's going to take him seriously if he's got a silly little title
p93
aVlike 'President of the United States of America'?"
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd after three weeks of debate, in the end,
p98
aVthe Senate did not cave in.
p99
aVInstead, they agreed to use the title "President" for now.
p100
aVBut they also wanted it absolutely set down
p101
aVthat they didn't agree with it,
p102
aVfrom a decent respect for the opinions and practice of civilized nations,
p103
aVwhether under republican or monarchical forms of government,
p104
aVwhose custom it is to annex,
p105
aVthrough the office of the Chief Magistrate,
p106
aVtitles of respectability \u2014
p107
aVnot bloody "President."
p108
aVAnd that, in the intercourse with foreign nations,
p109
aVthe majesty of the people of the United States
p110
aVmay not be hazarded by an appearance of singularity \u2014
p111
aVi.e., we don't want to look like bloody weirdos.
p112
aa(lp113
VNow, you can learn three interesting things from this.
p114
aVFirst of all \u2014 and this is my favorite \u2014
p115
aVis that, so far as I've ever been able to find out,
p116
aVthe Senate has never formally endorsed the title of President.
p117
aVBarack Obama, President Obama, is there on borrowed time,
p118
aVjust waiting for the Senate to spring into action.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VThe second thing you can learn
p123
aVis that, when a government says that this is a temporary measure \u2014
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
Vyou can still be waiting 223 years later.
p128
aa(lp129
VBut the third thing you can learn \u2014 and this is the really important one,
p130
aVthe point I want to leave you on \u2014
p131
aVis that the title, "President of the United States of America,"
p132
aVdoesn't sound that humble at all these days, does it?
p133
aVSomething to do with the slightly over 5,000
p134
aVnuclear warheads he has at his disposal
p135
aVand the largest economy in the world
p136
aVand a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff.
p137
aVReality and history have endowed that title with grandeur.
p138
aVAnd so the Senate won in the end.
p139
aVThey got their title of respectability.
p140
aVAnd also, the Senate's other worry, the appearance of singularity \u2014
p141
aVwell, it was a singularity back then.
p142
aVBut now, do you know how many nations have a president?
p143
aVA hundred and forty-seven.
p144
aVAll because they want to sound like the guy
p145
aVwho's got the 5,000 nuclear warheads, etc.
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd so, in the end, the Senate won
p148
aVand the House of Representatives lost ...
p149
aVbecause nobody's going to feel that humble
p150
aVwhen they're told that they are now
p151
aVthe President of the United States of America.
p152
aVAnd that's the important lesson I think you can take away,
p153
aVand the one I want to leave you with.
p154
aVPoliticians try to pick and use words to shape and control reality,
p155
aVbut in fact,
p156
aVreality changes words far more than words can ever change reality.
p157
aa(lp158
VThank you very much.

VSo, embryonic stem cells
p5
aVare really incredible cells.
p6
aVThey are our body's own repair kits,
p7
aVand they're pluripotent, which means they can morph into
p8
aVall of the cells in our bodies.
p9
aVSoon, we actually will be able to use stem cells
p10
aVto replace cells that are damaged or diseased.
p11
aa(lp12
VBut that's not what I want to talk to you about,
p13
aVbecause right now there are some really
p14
aVextraordinary things that we are doing with stem cells
p15
aVthat are completely changing
p16
aVthe way we look and model disease,
p17
aVour ability to understand why we get sick,
p18
aVand even develop drugs.
p19
aVI truly believe that stem cell research is going to allow
p20
aVour children to look at Alzheimer's and diabetes
p21
aVand other major diseases the way we view polio today,
p22
aVwhich is as a preventable disease.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo here we have this incredible field, which has
p25
aVenormous hope for humanity,
p26
aVbut much like IVF over 35 years ago,
p27
aVuntil the birth of a healthy baby, Louise,
p28
aVthis field has been under siege politically and financially.
p29
aVCritical research is being challenged instead of supported,
p30
aVand we saw that it was really essential to have
p31
aVprivate safe haven laboratories where this work
p32
aVcould be advanced without interference.
p33
aVAnd so, in 2005,
p34
aVwe started the New York Stem Cell Foundation Laboratory
p35
aVso that we would have a small organization that could
p36
aVdo this work and support it.
p37
aa(lp38
VWhat we saw very quickly is the world of both medical
p39
aVresearch, but also developing drugs and treatments,
p40
aVis dominated by, as you would expect, large organizations,
p41
aVbut in a new field, sometimes large organizations
p42
aVreally have trouble getting out of their own way,
p43
aVand sometimes they can't ask the right questions,
p44
aVand there is an enormous gap that's just gotten larger
p45
aVbetween academic research on the one hand
p46
aVand pharmaceutical companies and biotechs
p47
aVthat are responsible for delivering all of our drugs
p48
aVand many of our treatments, and so we knew that
p49
aVto really accelerate cures and therapies, we were going
p50
aVto have to address this with two things:
p51
aVnew technologies and also a new research model.
p52
aVBecause if you don't close that gap, you really are
p53
aVexactly where we are today.
p54
aVAnd that's what I want to focus on.
p55
aVWe've spent the last couple of years pondering this,
p56
aVmaking a list of the different things that we had to do,
p57
aVand so we developed a new technology,
p58
aVIt's software and hardware,
p59
aVthat actually can generate thousands and thousands of
p60
aVgenetically diverse stem cell lines to create
p61
aVa global array, essentially avatars of ourselves.
p62
aVAnd we did this because we think that it's actually going
p63
aVto allow us to realize the potential, the promise,
p64
aVof all of the sequencing of the human genome,
p65
aVbut it's going to allow us, in doing that,
p66
aVto actually do clinical trials in a dish with human cells,
p67
aVnot animal cells, to generate drugs and treatments
p68
aVthat are much more effective, much safer,
p69
aVmuch faster, and at a much lower cost.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo let me put that in perspective for you
p72
aVand give you some context.
p73
aVThis is an extremely new field.
p74
aVIn 1998, human embryonic stem cells
p75
aVwere first identified, and just nine years later,
p76
aVa group of scientists in Japan were able to take skin cells
p77
aVand reprogram them with very powerful viruses
p78
aVto create a kind of pluripotent stem cell
p79
aVcalled an induced pluripotent stem cell,
p80
aVor what we refer to as an IPS cell.
p81
aVThis was really an extraordinary advance, because
p82
aValthough these cells are not human embryonic stem cells,
p83
aVwhich still remain the gold standard,
p84
aVthey are terrific to use for modeling disease
p85
aVand potentially for drug discovery.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo a few months later, in 2008, one of our scientists
p88
aVbuilt on that research. He took skin biopsies,
p89
aVthis time from people who had a disease,
p90
aVALS, or as you call it in the U.K., motor neuron disease.
p91
aVHe turned them into the IPS cells
p92
aVthat I've just told you about, and then he turned those
p93
aVIPS cells into the motor neurons that actually
p94
aVwere dying in the disease.
p95
aVSo basically what he did was to take a healthy cell
p96
aVand turn it into a sick cell,
p97
aVand he recapitulated the disease over and over again
p98
aVin the dish, and this was extraordinary,
p99
aVbecause it was the first time that we had a model
p100
aVof a disease from a living patient in living human cells.
p101
aVAnd as he watched the disease unfold, he was able
p102
aVto discover that actually the motor neurons were dying
p103
aVin the disease in a different way than the field
p104
aVhad previously thought. There was another kind of cell
p105
aVthat actually was sending out a toxin
p106
aVand contributing to the death of these motor neurons,
p107
aVand you simply couldn't see it
p108
aVuntil you had the human model.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo you could really say that
p111
aVresearchers trying to understand the cause of disease
p112
aVwithout being able to have human stem cell models
p113
aVwere much like investigators trying to figure out
p114
aVwhat had gone terribly wrong in a plane crash
p115
aVwithout having a black box, or a flight recorder.
p116
aVThey could hypothesize about what had gone wrong,
p117
aVbut they really had no way of knowing what led
p118
aVto the terrible events.
p119
aVAnd stem cells really have given us the black box
p120
aVfor diseases, and it's an unprecedented window.
p121
aVIt really is extraordinary, because you can recapitulate
p122
aVmany, many diseases in a dish, you can see
p123
aVwhat begins to go wrong in the cellular conversation
p124
aVwell before you would ever see
p125
aVsymptoms appear in a patient.
p126
aVAnd this opens up the ability,
p127
aVwhich hopefully will become something that
p128
aVis routine in the near term,
p129
aVof using human cells to test for drugs.
p130
aa(lp131
VRight now, the way we test for drugs is pretty problematic.
p132
aVTo bring a successful drug to market, it takes, on average,
p133
aV13 years \u2014 that's one drug \u2014
p134
aVwith a sunk cost of 4 billion dollars,
p135
aVand only one percent of the drugs that start down that road
p136
aVare actually going to get there.
p137
aVYou can't imagine other businesses
p138
aVthat you would think of going into
p139
aVthat have these kind of numbers.
p140
aVIt's a terrible business model.
p141
aVBut it is really a worse social model because of
p142
aVwhat's involved and the cost to all of us.
p143
aVSo the way we develop drugs now
p144
aVis by testing promising compounds on \u2014
p145
aVWe didn't have disease modeling with human cells,
p146
aVso we'd been testing them on cells of mice
p147
aVor other creatures or cells that we engineer,
p148
aVbut they don't have the characteristics of the diseases
p149
aVthat we're actually trying to cure.
p150
aVYou know, we're not mice, and you can't go into
p151
aVa living person with an illness
p152
aVand just pull out a few brain cells or cardiac cells
p153
aVand then start fooling around in a lab to test
p154
aVfor, you know, a promising drug.
p155
aVBut what you can do with human stem cells, now,
p156
aVis actually create avatars, and you can create the cells,
p157
aVwhether it's the live motor neurons
p158
aVor the beating cardiac cells or liver cells
p159
aVor other kinds of cells, and you can test for drugs,
p160
aVpromising compounds, on the actual cells
p161
aVthat you're trying to affect, and this is now,
p162
aVand it's absolutely extraordinary,
p163
aVand you're going to know at the beginning,
p164
aVthe very early stages of doing your assay development
p165
aVand your testing, you're not going to have to wait 13 years
p166
aVuntil you've brought a drug to market, only to find out
p167
aVthat actually it doesn't work, or even worse, harms people.
p168
aa(lp169
VBut it isn't really enough just to look at
p170
aVthe cells from a few people or a small group of people,
p171
aVbecause we have to step back.
p172
aVWe've got to look at the big picture.
p173
aVLook around this room. We are all different,
p174
aVand a disease that I might have,
p175
aVif I had Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease,
p176
aVit probably would affect me differently than if
p177
aVone of you had that disease,
p178
aVand if we both had Parkinson's disease,
p179
aVand we took the same medication,
p180
aVbut we had different genetic makeup,
p181
aVwe probably would have a different result,
p182
aVand it could well be that a drug that worked wonderfully
p183
aVfor me was actually ineffective for you,
p184
aVand similarly, it could be that a drug that is harmful for you
p185
aVis safe for me, and, you know, this seems totally obvious,
p186
aVbut unfortunately it is not the way
p187
aVthat the pharmaceutical industry has been developing drugs
p188
aVbecause, until now, it hasn't had the tools.
p189
aa(lp190
VAnd so we need to move away
p191
aVfrom this one-size-fits-all model.
p192
aVThe way we've been developing drugs is essentially
p193
aVlike going into a shoe store,
p194
aVno one asks you what size you are, or
p195
aVif you're going dancing or hiking.
p196
aVThey just say, "Well, you have feet, here are your shoes."
p197
aVIt doesn't work with shoes, and our bodies are
p198
aVmany times more complicated than just our feet.
p199
aVSo we really have to change this.
p200
aa(lp201
VThere was a very sad example of this in the last decade.
p202
aVThere's a wonderful drug, and a class of drugs actually,
p203
aVbut the particular drug was Vioxx, and
p204
aVfor people who were suffering from severe arthritis pain,
p205
aVthe drug was an absolute lifesaver,
p206
aVbut unfortunately, for another subset of those people,
p207
aVthey suffered pretty severe heart side effects,
p208
aVand for a subset of those people, the side effects were
p209
aVso severe, the cardiac side effects, that they were fatal.
p210
aVBut imagine a different scenario,
p211
aVwhere we could have had an array, a genetically diverse array,
p212
aVof cardiac cells, and we could have actually tested
p213
aVthat drug, Vioxx, in petri dishes, and figured out,
p214
aVwell, okay, people with this genetic type are going to have
p215
aVcardiac side effects, people with these genetic subgroups
p216
aVor genetic shoes sizes, about 25,000 of them,
p217
aVare not going to have any problems.
p218
aVThe people for whom it was a lifesaver
p219
aVcould have still taken their medicine.
p220
aVThe people for whom it was a disaster, or fatal,
p221
aVwould never have been given it, and
p222
aVyou can imagine a very different outcome for the company,
p223
aVwho had to withdraw the drug.
p224
aa(lp225
VSo that is terrific,
p226
aVand we thought, all right,
p227
aVas we're trying to solve this problem,
p228
aVclearly we have to think about genetics,
p229
aVwe have to think about human testing,
p230
aVbut there's a fundamental problem,
p231
aVbecause right now, stem cell lines,
p232
aVas extraordinary as they are,
p233
aVand lines are just groups of cells,
p234
aVthey are made by hand, one at a time,
p235
aVand it takes a couple of months.
p236
aVThis is not scalable, and also when you do things by hand,
p237
aVeven in the best laboratories,
p238
aVyou have variations in techniques,
p239
aVand you need to know, if you're making a drug,
p240
aVthat the Aspirin you're going to take out of the bottle
p241
aVon Monday is the same as the Aspirin
p242
aVthat's going to come out of the bottle on Wednesday.
p243
aVSo we looked at this, and we thought, okay,
p244
aVartisanal is wonderful in, you know, your clothing
p245
aVand your bread and crafts, but
p246
aVartisanal really isn't going to work in stem cells,
p247
aVso we have to deal with this.
p248
aa(lp249
VBut even with that, there still was another big hurdle,
p250
aVand that actually brings us back to
p251
aVthe mapping of the human genome, because
p252
aVwe're all different.
p253
aVWe know from the sequencing of the human genome
p254
aVthat it's shown us all of the A's, C's, G's and T's
p255
aVthat make up our genetic code,
p256
aVbut that code, by itself, our DNA,
p257
aVis like looking at the ones and zeroes of the computer code
p258
aVwithout having a computer that can read it.
p259
aVIt's like having an app without having a smartphone.
p260
aVWe needed to have a way of bringing the biology
p261
aVto that incredible data,
p262
aVand the way to do that was to find
p263
aVa stand-in, a biological stand-in,
p264
aVthat could contain all of the genetic information,
p265
aVbut have it be arrayed in such a way
p266
aVas it could be read together
p267
aVand actually create this incredible avatar.
p268
aVWe need to have stem cells from all the genetic sub-types
p269
aVthat represent who we are.
p270
aa(lp271
VSo this is what we've built.
p272
aVIt's an automated robotic technology.
p273
aVIt has the capacity to produce thousands and thousands
p274
aVof stem cell lines. It's genetically arrayed.
p275
aVIt has massively parallel processing capability,
p276
aVand it's going to change the way drugs are discovered,
p277
aVwe hope, and I think eventually what's going to happen
p278
aVis that we're going to want to re-screen drugs,
p279
aVon arrays like this, that already exist,
p280
aVall of the drugs that currently exist,
p281
aVand in the future, you're going to be taking drugs
p282
aVand treatments that have been tested for side effects
p283
aVon all of the relevant cells,
p284
aVon brain cells and heart cells and liver cells.
p285
aa(lp286
VIt really has brought us to the threshold
p287
aVof personalized medicine.
p288
aVIt's here now, and in our family,
p289
aVmy son has type 1 diabetes,
p290
aVwhich is still an incurable disease,
p291
aVand I lost my parents to heart disease and cancer,
p292
aVbut I think that my story probably sounds familiar to you,
p293
aVbecause probably a version of it is your story.
p294
aVAt some point in our lives, all of us,
p295
aVor people we care about, become patients,
p296
aVand that's why I think that stem cell research
p297
aVis incredibly important for all of us.
p298
aVThank you. (Applause)

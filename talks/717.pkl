VThe anger in me against corruption
p5
aVmade me to make a big career change
p6
aVlast year, becoming a full-time practicing lawyer.
p7
aVMy experiences over the last 18 months,
p8
aVas a lawyer, has seeded in me
p9
aVa new entrepreneurial idea,
p10
aVwhich I believe is indeed
p11
aVworth spreading.
p12
aVSo, I share it with all of you here today,
p13
aVthough the idea itself is getting crystallized
p14
aVand I'm still writing up the business plan.
p15
aVOf course it helps that fear of public failure
p16
aVdiminishes as the number of ideas
p17
aVwhich have failed increases.
p18
aa(lp19
VI've been a huge fan of enterprise and entrepreneurship
p20
aVsince 1993.
p21
aVI've explored, experienced,
p22
aVand experimented enterprise
p23
aVand capitalism to my heart's content.
p24
aVI built, along with my two brothers,
p25
aVthe leading real estate company in my home state, Kerala,
p26
aVand then worked professionally
p27
aVwith two of India's biggest businessmen,
p28
aVbut in their startup enterprises.
p29
aVIn 2003, when I stepped out of the pure play capitalistic sector
p30
aVto work on so-called social sector issues,
p31
aVI definitely did not have any grand strategy
p32
aVor plan to pursue and find
p33
aVfor-profit solutions
p34
aVto addressing pressing public issues.
p35
aa(lp36
VWhen life brought about a series
p37
aVof death and near-death experiences
p38
aVwithin my close circle,
p39
aVwhich highlighted the need
p40
aVfor an emergency medical response service in India,
p41
aVsimilar to 911 in USA.
p42
aVTo address this, I, along with four friends,
p43
aVfounded Ambulance Access for All,
p44
aVto promote life-support ambulance services in India.
p45
aVFor those from the developing world,
p46
aVthere is nothing, absolutely nothing new in this idea.
p47
aVBut as we envisioned it,
p48
aVwe had three key goals:
p49
aVProviding world-class life support ambulance service
p50
aVwhich is fully self-sustainable from its own revenue streams,
p51
aVand universally accessible
p52
aVto anyone in a medical emergency,
p53
aVirrespective of the capability to pay.
p54
aVThe service which grew out of this,
p55
aVDial 1298 for Ambulance,
p56
aVwith one ambulance in 2004,
p57
aVnow has a hundred-plus ambulances in three states,
p58
aVand has transported over 100,000 patients
p59
aVand victims since inception.
p60
aa(lp61
VThe service is \u2014 (Applause)
p62
aVfully self-sustainable from its own revenues,
p63
aVwithout accessing any public funds,
p64
aVand the cross-subsidy model actually works,
p65
aVwhere the rich pays higher, poor pays lower,
p66
aVand the accident victim is getting the service free of charge.
p67
aVThe service responded effectively
p68
aVand efficiently,
p69
aVduring the unfortunate
p70
aV26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.
p71
aVAnd as you can see from the visuals,
p72
aVthe service was responding and rescuing
p73
aVvictims from the incident locations
p74
aVeven before the police could cordon off
p75
aVthe incident locations
p76
aVand formally confirm it as a terror strike.
p77
aVWe ended up being the first medical response team
p78
aVin every incident location
p79
aVand transported 125 victims,
p80
aVsaving life.
p81
aa(lp82
V(Applause)
p83
aa(lp84
VIn tribute and remembrance
p85
aVof 26/11 attacks
p86
aVover the last one year,
p87
aVwe have actually helped a Pakistani NGO,
p88
aVAman Foundation,
p89
aVto set up a self-sustainable life support ambulance service
p90
aVin Karachi, facilitated by Acumen Fund.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Applause)
p93
aa(lp94
VIt's a small message from us,
p95
aVin our own small way
p96
aVto the enemies of humanity,
p97
aVof Islam, of South Asia,
p98
aVof India, and of Pakistan,
p99
aVthat humanity will continue to bloom,
p100
aVirrespective of such dastardly attacks.
p101
aVSince then I've also co-founded two other social enterprises.
p102
aVOne is Education Access for All,
p103
aVsetting up schools in small-town India.
p104
aVAnd the other is Moksha-Yug Access,
p105
aVwhich is integrating rural supply chain
p106
aVon the foundations of self-help group-based microfinance.
p107
aVI guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right.
p108
aVBecause diligent investors and venture funds
p109
aVhave committed over 7.5 million dollars in funding.
p110
aVWith the significance being these funds have come in
p111
aVas a QT capital, not as grant or as philanthropy.
p112
aa(lp113
VNow I come back to the idea of the new social enterprise
p114
aVthat I'm exploring.
p115
aVCorruption, bribes, and lack of transparency.
p116
aVYou may be surprised to know
p117
aVthat eight speakers yesterday
p118
aVactually mentioned these terms in their talks.
p119
aVBribes and corruption have both a demand and a supply side,
p120
aVwith the supply side being mostly of
p121
aVgreedy corporate unethical businesses
p122
aVand hapless common man.
p123
aVAnd the demand side being mostly politicians,
p124
aVbureaucrats and those who have discretionary power
p125
aVvested with them.
p126
aa(lp127
VAccording to World Bank estimate,
p128
aVone trillion dollars is paid in bribes
p129
aVevery year, worsening the condition
p130
aVof the already worse off.
p131
aVYet, if you analyze the common man,
p132
aVhe or she does not wake up every day and say,
p133
aV"Hmm, let me see who I can pay a bribe to today."
p134
aVor, "Let me see who I can corrupt today."
p135
aVOften it is the constraining or the back-to-the-wall situation
p136
aVthat the hapless common man finds himself or herself in
p137
aVthat leads him to pay a bribe.
p138
aVIn the modern day world, where time is premium
p139
aVand battle for subsistence is unimaginably tough,
p140
aVthe hapless common man
p141
aVsimply gives in and pays the bribe just to get on with life.
p142
aa(lp143
VNow, let me ask you another question.
p144
aVImagine you are being asked to pay a bribe
p145
aVin your day-to-day life to get something done.
p146
aVWhat do you do? Of course you can call the police.
p147
aVBut what is the use if the police department is in itself steeped in corruption?
p148
aVMost definitely you don't want to pay the bribe.
p149
aVBut you also don't have the time, resources,
p150
aVexpertise or wherewithal to fight this.
p151
aVUnfortunately, many of us in this room
p152
aVare supporters of capitalist policies and market forces.
p153
aa(lp154
VYet the market forces around the world
p155
aVhave not yet thrown up a service where you can call in,
p156
aVpay a fee, and fight the demand for a bribe.
p157
aVLike a bribe buster service,
p158
aVor 1-800-Fight-Bribes,
p159
aVor www.stopbribes.org or
p160
aVwww.preventcorruption.org.
p161
aVSuch a service simply do not exist.
p162
aVOne image that has haunted me
p163
aVfrom my early business days
p164
aVis of a grandmother, 70 plus years, being harassed
p165
aVby the bureaucrats in the town planning office.
p166
aVAll she needed was permission to build three steps
p167
aVto her house, from ground level,
p168
aVmaking it easier for her to enter and exit her house.
p169
aVYet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit
p170
aVfor want of a bribe.
p171
aVEven though it pricked my conscience then,
p172
aVI could not, or rather I did not
p173
aVtend to her or assist her,
p174
aVbecause I was busy building my real estate company.
p175
aVI don't want to be haunted by such images any more.
p176
aa(lp177
VA group of us have been working on a pilot basis
p178
aVto address individual instances of demands
p179
aVfor bribes for common services or entitlement.
p180
aVAnd in all 42 cases where we have pushed back such demands
p181
aVusing existing and legitimate tools
p182
aVlike the Right to Information Act,
p183
aVvideo, audio, or peer pressure,
p184
aVwe have successfully obtained whatever our clients
p185
aVset out to achieve without actually paying a bribe.
p186
aVAnd with the cost of these tools being substantially lower
p187
aVthan the bribe demanded.
p188
aVI believe that these tools that worked in these 42 pilot cases
p189
aVcan be consolidated in standard processes
p190
aVin a BPO kind of environment,
p191
aVand made available on web, call-center
p192
aVand franchise physical offices,
p193
aVfor a fee, to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe.
p194
aVThe target market is as tempting as it can get.
p195
aVIt can be worth up to one trillion dollars,
p196
aVbeing paid in bribes every year,
p197
aVor equal to India's GDP.
p198
aVAnd it is an absolutely virgin market.
p199
aa(lp200
VI propose to explore this idea further,
p201
aVto examine the potential of creating
p202
aVa for-profit, fee-based BPO
p203
aVkind of service to stop bribes
p204
aVand prevent corruption.
p205
aVI do realize that the fight for justice
p206
aVagainst corruption is never easy.
p207
aVIt never has been and it never will be.
p208
aVIn my last 18 months as a lawyer,
p209
aVbattling small- and large-scale corruption,
p210
aVincluding the one perpetrated by India's biggest corporate scamster.
p211
aVThrough his charities
p212
aVI have had three police cases filed against me
p213
aValleging trespass, impersonation and intimidation.
p214
aVThe battle against corruption
p215
aVexacts a toll on ourselves,
p216
aVour families, our friends, and even our kids.
p217
aVYet I believe the price we pay is well worth holding on
p218
aVto our dignity and making the world a fairer place.
p219
aa(lp220
VWhat gives us the courage?
p221
aVAs my close friend replied, when told
p222
aVduring the seeding days of the ambulance project
p223
aVthat it is an impossible task
p224
aVand the founders are insane to chalk up their blue-chip jobs,
p225
aVI quote: "Of course we cannot fail in this,
p226
aVat least in our own minds.
p227
aVFor we are insane people,
p228
aVtrying to do an impossible task.
p229
aVAnd an insane person does not know what an impossible task is." Thank you.
p230
aa(lp231
V(Applause)
p232
aa(lp233
VChris Anderson: Shaffi, that is a really exciting business idea.
p234
aVShaffi Mather: I just have to get through the initial days where I don't get eliminated.
p235
aa(lp236
V(Laughter)
p237
aa(lp238
VCA: What's on your mind?
p239
aVI mean, give us a sense of the numbers here \u2014
p240
aVa typical bribe and a typical fee. I mean, what's in your head?
p241
aa(lp242
VSM: So let me ... Let me give you an example.
p243
aVSomebody who had applied for the passport.
p244
aVThe officer was just sitting on it
p245
aVand was demanding around 3,000 rupees in bribes.
p246
aVAnd he did not want to pay.
p247
aVSo we actually used the Right to Information Act,
p248
aVwhich is equal to the Freedom of Information Act in the United States,
p249
aVand pushed back the officers in this particular case.
p250
aVAnd in all these 42 cases,
p251
aVwhen we kept pushing them back,
p252
aVthere was three kinds of reaction.
p253
aVA set of people actually say,
p254
aV"Oh, let me just grant it to them, and run away from it."
p255
aVSome people actually come back and say,
p256
aV"Oh, you want to screw me. Let me show you what I can do."
p257
aVAnd he will push us back.
p258
aVSo you take the next step, or use the next tool available
p259
aVin what we are putting together,
p260
aVand then he relents.
p261
aVBy the third time, in all 42 cases, we have achieved success.
p262
aa(lp263
VCA: But if it's a 3,000-rupee, 70-dollar bribe,
p264
aVwhat fee would you have to charge,
p265
aVand can you actually make the business work?
p266
aa(lp267
VSM: Well, actually the cost that we incurred
p268
aVwas less than 200 rupees.
p269
aVSo, it actually works.
p270
aa(lp271
VCA: That's a high gross margin business. I like it.
p272
aa(lp273
V(Laughter)
p274
aa(lp275
VSM: I actually did not want to answer this on the TED stage.
p276
aa(lp277
VCA: OK, so these are provisional numbers, no pricing guarantee.
p278
aVIf you can pull this off, you will be a global hero.
p279
aVI mean, this could be huge.
p280
aVThank you so much for sharing this idea at TED.

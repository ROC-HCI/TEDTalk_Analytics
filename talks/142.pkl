VI'm going to talk to you today about
p5
aVhopefully converting fear into hope.
p6
aVWhen we go to the physician today \u2014
p7
aVwhen we go to the doctor's office and we walk in,
p8
aVthere are words that we just don't want to hear.
p9
aVThere are words that we're truly afraid of.
p10
aVDiabetes, cancer, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's,
p11
aVheart failure, lung failure \u2014
p12
aVthings that we know are debilitating diseases,
p13
aVfor which there's relatively little that can be done.
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd what I want to lay out for you today is
p16
aVa different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease,
p17
aVwhy it's important,
p18
aVwhy without it perhaps our health care system will melt down
p19
aVif you think it already hasn't,
p20
aVand where we are clinically today, and where we might go tomorrow,
p21
aVand what some of the hurdles are.
p22
aVAnd we're going to do all of that in 18 minutes, I promise.
p23
aa(lp24
VI want to start with this slide,
p25
aVbecause this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it.
p26
aVThis was an issue from 2002
p27
aVthat they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human.
p28
aVIt was basically a regenerative medicine issue.
p29
aVRegenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept
p30
aVthat everybody can understand.
p31
aVIt's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself
p32
aVto a clinically relevant timescale.
p33
aVSo we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there.
p34
aVWe know that if we have a damaged hip, you can put an artificial hip in.
p35
aVAnd this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover.
p36
aa(lp37
VThis is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine.
p38
aVThis is not regenerative medicine.
p39
aVRegenerative medicine is what Business Week put up
p40
aVwhen they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago.
p41
aVThe idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms
p42
aVwith devices and drugs and the like \u2014
p43
aVand I'll come back to that theme a few times \u2014
p44
aVinstead of doing that, we will regenerate lost function of the body
p45
aVby regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue.
p46
aVSo that at the end of the treatment,
p47
aVyou are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment.
p48
aa(lp49
VVery few good ideas \u2014 if you agree that this is a good idea \u2014
p50
aVvery few good ideas are truly novel.
p51
aVAnd this is just the same.
p52
aVIf you look back in history,
p53
aVCharles Lindbergh, who was better known for flying airplanes,
p54
aVwas actually one of the first people
p55
aValong with Alexis Carrel, one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller,
p56
aVto begin to think about, could you culture organs?
p57
aVAnd they published this book in 1937,
p58
aVwhere they actually began to think about,
p59
aVwhat could you do in bio-reactors to grow whole organs?
p60
aVWe've come a long way since then.
p61
aVI'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on.
p62
aa(lp63
VBut before doing that, what I'd like to do
p64
aVis share my depression about the health care system
p65
aVand the need for this with you.
p66
aVMany of the talks yesterday talked about
p67
aVimproving the quality of life, and reducing poverty,
p68
aVand essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe.
p69
aVOne of the challenges is that the richer we are, the longer we live.
p70
aVAnd the longer we live, the more expensive it is
p71
aVto take care of our diseases as we get older.
p72
aa(lp73
VThis is simply the wealth of a country
p74
aVversus the percent of population over the age of 65.
p75
aVAnd you can basically see that the richer a country is,
p76
aVthe older the people are within it.
p77
aVWhy is this important?
p78
aVAnd why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now?
p79
aVIf the average age of your population is 30,
p80
aVthen the average kind of disease that you have to treat
p81
aVis maybe a broken ankle every now and again,
p82
aVmaybe a little bit of asthma.
p83
aVIf the average age in your country is 45 to 55,
p84
aVnow the average person is looking at diabetes,
p85
aVearly-onset diabetes, heart failure, coronary artery disease \u2014
p86
aVthings that are inherently more difficult to treat,
p87
aVand much more expensive to treat.
p88
aa(lp89
VJust have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here.
p90
aVThis is from "The Untied States of America."
p91
aVIn 1930, there were 41 workers per retiree.
p92
aV41 people who were basically outside of being really sick,
p93
aVpaying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease.
p94
aVIn 2010, two workers per retiree in the U.S.
p95
aVAnd this is matched in every industrialized, wealthy country in the world.
p96
aVHow can you actually afford to treat patients
p97
aVwhen the reality of getting old looks like this?
p98
aa(lp99
VThis is age versus cost of health care.
p100
aVAnd you can see that right around age 45, 40 to 45,
p101
aVthere's a sudden spike in the cost of health care.
p102
aVIt's actually quite interesting. If you do the right studies,
p103
aVyou can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care,
p104
aVplotted over your lifetime.
p105
aVAnd about seven years before you're about to die, there's a spike.
p106
aVAnd you can actually \u2014
p107
aV(Laughter)
p108
aV\u2014 we won't get into that.
p109
aV(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VThere are very few things, very few things that you can really do
p112
aVthat will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases
p113
aVand experience what I would call healthy aging.
p114
aVI'd suggest there are four things,
p115
aVand none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system.
p116
aVAll those things do is change who pays.
p117
aVThey don't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is.
p118
aa(lp119
VOne thing you can do is not treat. You can ration health care.
p120
aVWe won't talk about that anymore. It's too depressing.
p121
aVYou can prevent.
p122
aVObviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention.
p123
aa(lp124
VBut perhaps most interesting, to me anyway, and most important,
p125
aVis the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression,
p126
aVand then treating the disease to cure the disease
p127
aVinstead of treating a symptom.
p128
aVThink of it in terms of diabetes, for instance.
p129
aVToday, with diabetes, what do we do?
p130
aVWe diagnose the disease eventually, once it becomes symptomatic,
p131
aVand then we treat the symptom for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.
p132
aVAnd we do OK. Insulin's a pretty good therapy.
p133
aVBut eventually it stops working,
p134
aVand diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease.
p135
aa(lp136
VWhy couldn't we just inject the pancreas with something
p137
aVto regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease,
p138
aVperhaps even before it was symptomatic?
p139
aVAnd it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it,
p140
aVbut if it worked, we would truly be able to do something different.
p141
aa(lp142
VThis video, I think, gets across the concept that I'm talking about quite dramatically.
p143
aVThis is a newt re-growing its limb.
p144
aVIf a newt can do this kind of thing, why can't we?
p145
aVI'll actually show you some more important features
p146
aVabout limb regeneration in a moment.
p147
aVBut what we're talking about in regenerative medicine
p148
aVis doing this in every organ system of the body,
p149
aVfor tissues and for organs themselves.
p150
aVSo today's reality is that if we get sick,
p151
aVthe message is we will treat your symptoms,
p152
aVand you need to adjust to a new way of life.
p153
aa(lp154
VI would pose to you that tomorrow \u2014
p155
aVand when tomorrow is we could debate,
p156
aVbut it's within the foreseeable future \u2014
p157
aVwe will talk about regenerative rehabilitation.
p158
aVThere's a limb prosthetic up here,
p159
aVsimilar actually one on the soldier
p160
aVthat's come back from Iraq.
p161
aVThere are 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs.
p162
aVImagine if instead of facing that, they could actually
p163
aVface the regeneration of that limb.
p164
aVIt's a wild concept.
p165
aVI'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept.
p166
aa(lp167
VBut it's applicable, again, to every organ system.
p168
aVHow can we do that?
p169
aVThe way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body.
p170
aVWe need to learn to speak the body's language.
p171
aVAnd to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus.
p172
aVA mammalian fetus, if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy,
p173
aVwill re-grow that limb.
p174
aVSo our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound-healing mechanisms.
p175
aVIt's a natural process,
p176
aVbut it is lost as we age.
p177
aVIn a child, before the age of about six months,
p178
aVif they lose their fingertip in an accident,
p179
aVthey'll re-grow their fingertip.
p180
aVBy the time they're five, they won't be able to do that anymore.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo to engage in that conversation with the body,
p183
aVwe need to speak the body's language.
p184
aVAnd there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today.
p185
aVI'm going to give you an example of three of these tools
p186
aVthrough which to converse with the body.
p187
aa(lp188
VThe first is cellular therapies.
p189
aVClearly, we heal ourselves in a natural process,
p190
aVusing cells to do most of the work.
p191
aVTherefore, if we can find the right cells
p192
aVand implant them in the body, they may do the healing.
p193
aVSecondly, we can use materials.
p194
aVWe heard yesterday about the importance of new materials.
p195
aVIf we can invent materials, design materials,
p196
aVor extract materials from a natural environment,
p197
aVthen we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself.
p198
aVAnd finally, we may be able to use smart devices
p199
aVthat will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal.
p200
aa(lp201
VI'm going to show you an example of each of these,
p202
aVand I'm going to start with materials.
p203
aVSteve Badylak \u2014 who's at the University of Pittsburgh \u2014
p204
aVabout a decade ago had a remarkable idea.
p205
aVAnd that idea was that the small intestine of a pig,
p206
aVif you threw away all the cells,
p207
aVand if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active,
p208
aVmay contain all of the necessary factors and signals
p209
aVthat would signal the body to heal itself.
p210
aVAnd he asked a very important question.
p211
aVHe asked the question,
p212
aVif I take that material, which is a natural material
p213
aVthat usually induces healing in the small intestine,
p214
aVand I place it somewhere else on a person's body,
p215
aVwould it give a tissue-specific response,
p216
aVor would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear?
p217
aa(lp218
VI wouldn't be telling you this story if it weren't compelling.
p219
aVThe picture I'm about to show you
p220
aVis a compelling picture.
p221
aV(Laughter)
p222
aVHowever, for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish \u2014
p223
aVeven though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends \u2014
p224
aVthe lights are down. This is a good time to look at your feet,
p225
aVcheck your Blackberry, do anything other than look at the screen.
p226
aV(Laughter)
p227
aa(lp228
VWhat I'm about to show you is a diabetic ulcer.
p229
aVAnd although \u2014 it's good to laugh before we look at this.
p230
aVThis is the reality of diabetes.
p231
aVI think a lot of times we hear about diabetics, diabetic ulcers,
p232
aVwe just don't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment,
p233
aVwhich is amputation, if you can't heal it.
p234
aVSo I'm going to put the slide up now. It won't be up for long.
p235
aVThis is a diabetic ulcer. It's tragic.
p236
aVThe treatment for this is amputation.
p237
aVThis is an older lady. She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes,
p238
aVand has decided to die with what' s left of her body intact.
p239
aa(lp240
VAnd this lady decided, after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer,
p241
aVthat she would try this new therapy that Steve invented.
p242
aVThat's what the wound looked like 11 weeks later.
p243
aVThat material contained only natural signals.
p244
aVAnd that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response
p245
aVthat it didn't have before.
p246
aa(lp247
VThere's going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you \u2014
p248
aVI'll let you know when you can look again.
p249
aVThis is a horse. The horse is not in pain.
p250
aVIf the horse was in pain, I wouldn't show you this slide.
p251
aVThe horse just has another nostril that's developed
p252
aVbecause of a riding accident.
p253
aVJust a few weeks after treatment \u2014
p254
aVin this case, taking that material, turning it into a gel,
p255
aVand packing that area, and then repeating the treatment a few times \u2014
p256
aVand the horse heals up.
p257
aVAnd if you took an ultrasound of that area, it would look great.
p258
aa(lp259
VHere's a dolphin where the fin's been re-attached.
p260
aVThere are now 400,000 patients around the world
p261
aVwho have used that material to heal their wounds.
p262
aVCould you regenerate a limb?
p263
aVDARPA just gave Steve 15 million dollars to lead an eight-institution project
p264
aVto begin the process of asking that question.
p265
aa(lp266
VAnd I'll show you the 15 million dollar picture.
p267
aVThis is a 78 year-old man who's lost the end of his fingertip.
p268
aVRemember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips.
p269
aVAfter treatment that's what it looks like.
p270
aVThis is happening today.
p271
aVThis is clinically relevant today.
p272
aVThere are materials that do this. Here are the heart patches.
p273
aa(lp274
VBut could you go a little further?
p275
aVCould you, say, instead of using material,
p276
aVcan I take some cells along with the material,
p277
aVand remove a damaged piece of tissue,
p278
aVput a bio-degradable material on there?
p279
aVYou can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish.
p280
aVThis was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women's Hospital.
p281
aVHe can actually grow beating tissue in a dish.
p282
aVHe chills the dish, it changes its properties
p283
aVand he peels it right out of the dish.
p284
aVIt's the coolest stuff.
p285
aa(lp286
VNow I'm going to show you cell-based regeneration.
p287
aVAnd what I'm going to show you here
p288
aVis stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient.
p289
aVAgain, if you're squeamish, you don't want to watch.
p290
aVBut this one's kind of cool.
p291
aVSo this is a bypass operation, just like what Al Gore had,
p292
aVwith a difference.
p293
aVIn this case, at the end of the bypass operation,
p294
aVyou're going to see the stem cells from the patient
p295
aVthat were removed at the beginning of the procedure
p296
aVbeing injected directly into the heart of the patient.
p297
aVAnd I'm standing up here because at one point
p298
aVI'm going to show you just how early this technology is.
p299
aVHere go the stem cells, right into the beating heart of the patient.
p300
aVAnd if you look really carefully,
p301
aVit's going to be right around this point
p302
aVyou'll actually see a back-flush.
p303
aVYou see the cells coming back out.
p304
aVWe need all sorts of new technology, new devices,
p305
aVto get the cells to the right place at the right time.
p306
aa(lp307
VJust a little bit of data, a tiny bit of data.
p308
aVThis was a randomized trial.
p309
aVAt this time this was an N of 20. Now there's an N of about 100.
p310
aVBasically, if you take an extremely sick patient
p311
aVand you give them a bypass, they get a little bit better.
p312
aVIf you give them stem cells as well as their bypass,
p313
aVfor these particular patients, they became asymptomatic.
p314
aVThese are now two years out.
p315
aVThe coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early,
p316
aVand prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state.
p317
aa(lp318
VThis is the same procedure, but now done minimally invasively,
p319
aVwith only three holes in the body where they're taking the heart
p320
aVand simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure.
p321
aVThere go the cells.
p322
aVWe don't have time to go into all of those details,
p323
aVbut basically, that works too.
p324
aVYou can take patients who are less sick,
p325
aVand bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state
p326
aVthrough that kind of therapy.
p327
aa(lp328
VHere's another example of stem-cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet,
p329
aVbut I think very soon will be.
p330
aVThis is the work of Kacey Marra from Pittsburgh,
p331
aValong with a number of colleagues around the world.
p332
aVThey've decided that liposuction fluid,
p333
aVwhich \u2014 in the United States, we have a lot of liposuction fluid.
p334
aV(Laughter)
p335
aVIt's a great source of stem cells.
p336
aVStem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid.
p337
aVSo you could go in, you could get your tummy-tuck.
p338
aVOut comes the liposuction fluid,
p339
aVand in this case, the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons.
p340
aVAll done in the lab.
p341
aVAnd I think fairly soon, you will see patients being treated
p342
aVwith their own fat-derived, or adipose-derived, stem cells.
p343
aa(lp344
VI talked before about the use of devices
p345
aVto dramatically change the way we treat disease.
p346
aVHere's just one example before I close up.
p347
aVThis is equally tragic.
p348
aVWe have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership
p349
aVwith our colleagues at the Institute for Surgical Research in the US Army,
p350
aVwho have to treat the now 11,000 kids that have come back from Iraq.
p351
aVMany of those patients are very severely burned.
p352
aa(lp353
VAnd if there's anything that's been learned about burn,
p354
aVit's that we don't know how to treat it.
p355
aVEverything that is done to treat burn \u2014
p356
aVbasically we do a sodding approach.
p357
aVWe make something over here,
p358
aVand then we transplant it onto the site of the wound,
p359
aVand we try and get the two to take.
p360
aVIn this case here, a new, wearable bio-reactor has been designed \u2014
p361
aVit should be tested clinically later this year at ISR \u2014
p362
aVby Joerg Gerlach in Pittsburgh.
p363
aVAnd that bio-reactor will lay down in the wound bed.
p364
aVThe gun that you see there sprays cells.
p365
aVThat's going to spray cells over that area.
p366
aVThe reactor will serve to fertilize the environment,
p367
aVdeliver other things as well at the same time,
p368
aVand therefore we will seed that lawn,
p369
aVas opposed to try the sodding approach.
p370
aVIt's a completely different way of doing it.
p371
aa(lp372
VSo my 18 minutes is up.
p373
aVSo let me finish up with some good news,
p374
aVand maybe a little bit of bad news.
p375
aVThe good news is that this is happening today.
p376
aVIt's very powerful work.
p377
aVClearly the images kind of get that across.
p378
aVIt's incredibly difficult because it's highly inter-disciplinary.
p379
aVAlmost every field of science engineering and clinical practice
p380
aVis involved in trying to get this to happen.
p381
aa(lp382
VA number of governments, and a number of regions,
p383
aVhave recognized that this is a new way to treat disease.
p384
aVThe Japanese government were perhaps the first,
p385
aVwhen they decided to invest first 3 billion,
p386
aVlater another 2 billion in this field.
p387
aVIt's no coincidence.
p388
aVJapan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age.
p389
aVThey need this to work or their health system dies.
p390
aVSo they're putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area.
p391
aVThe European Union, same thing.
p392
aVChina, the same thing.
p393
aVChina just launched a national tissue-engineering center.
p394
aVThe first year budget was 250 million US dollars.
p395
aa(lp396
VIn the United States we've had a somewhat different approach.
p397
aV(Laughter)
p398
aVOh, for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president.
p399
aVWe've had a different approach.
p400
aVAnd the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along.
p401
aVBut there's been no strategic investment
p402
aVto bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way.
p403
aa(lp404
VAnd I'm going to finish up with a quote, maybe a little cheap shot,
p405
aVat the director of the NIH, who's a very charming man.
p406
aVMyself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard
p407
aVwent to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute
p408
aVjust a few months ago,
p409
aVto try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece
p410
aVof that 27.5 billion dollars that he's going to get next year
p411
aVand focus it, in a strategic way, to make sure we can accelerate the pace
p412
aVat which these things get to patients.
p413
aVAnd at the end of a very testy meeting,
p414
aVwhat the NIH director said was,
p415
aV"Your vision is larger than our appetite."
p416

VI live in South Central.
p5
aVThis is South Central:
p6
aVliquor stores,
p7
aVfast food,
p8
aVvacant lots.
p9
aa(lp10
VSo the city planners, they get together and they figure
p11
aVthey're going to change the name South Central to make it represent something else,
p12
aVso they change it to South Los Angeles,
p13
aVlike this is going to fix what's really going wrong in the city.
p14
aVThis is South Los Angeles. (Laughter)
p15
aVLiquor stores,
p16
aVfast food,
p17
aVvacant lots.
p18
aa(lp19
VJust like 26.5 million other Americans,
p20
aVI live in a food desert,
p21
aVSouth Central Los Angeles,
p22
aVhome of the drive-thru and the drive-by.
p23
aVFunny thing is, the drive-thrus are killing more people than the drive-bys.
p24
aVPeople are dying from curable diseases
p25
aVin South Central Los Angeles.
p26
aVFor instance, the obesity rate in my neighborhood
p27
aVis five times higher than, say, Beverly Hills,
p28
aVwhich is probably eight, 10 miles away.
p29
aa(lp30
VI got tired of seeing this happening.
p31
aVAnd I was wondering, how would you feel
p32
aVif you had no access to healthy food,
p33
aVif every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects
p34
aVthat the present food system has on your neighborhood?
p35
aVI see wheelchairs bought and sold
p36
aVlike used cars.
p37
aVI see dialysis centers popping up like Starbucks.
p38
aVAnd I figured, this has to stop.
p39
aVSo I figured that the problem is the solution.
p40
aVFood is the problem and food is the solution.
p41
aVPlus I got tired of driving 45 minutes round trip
p42
aVto get an apple that wasn't impregnated with pesticides.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo what I did, I planted a food forest in front of my house.
p45
aVIt was on a strip of land that we call a parkway.
p46
aVIt's 150 feet by 10 feet.
p47
aVThing is, it's owned by the city.
p48
aVBut you have to maintain it.
p49
aVSo I'm like, "Cool. I can do whatever the hell I want,
p50
aVsince it's my responsibility and I gotta maintain it."
p51
aVAnd this is how I decided to maintain it.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo me and my group, L.A. Green Grounds, we got together
p54
aVand we started planting my food forest, fruit trees,
p55
aVyou know, the whole nine, vegetables.
p56
aVWhat we do, we're a pay-it-forward kind of group,
p57
aVwhere it's composed of gardeners from all walks of life,
p58
aVfrom all over the city, and it's completely volunteer,
p59
aVand everything we do is free.
p60
aVAnd the garden, it was beautiful.
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd then somebody complained.
p63
aVThe city came down on me,
p64
aVand basically gave me a citation saying that I had to remove my garden,
p65
aVwhich this citation was turning into a warrant.
p66
aVAnd I'm like, "Come on, really?
p67
aVA warrant for planting food on a piece of land
p68
aVthat you could care less about?" (Laughter)
p69
aVAnd I was like, "Cool. Bring it."
p70
aVBecause this time it wasn't coming up.
p71
aVSo L.A. Times got ahold of it. Steve Lopez did a story on it
p72
aVand talked to the councilman,
p73
aVand one of the Green Grounds members,
p74
aVthey put up a petition on Change.org,
p75
aVand with 900 signatures, we were a success.
p76
aVWe had a victory on our hands.
p77
aVMy councilman even called in and said how they endorse
p78
aVand love what we're doing.
p79
aVI mean, come on, why wouldn't they?
p80
aVL.A. leads the United States in vacant lots that the city actually owns.
p81
aVThey own 26 square miles of vacant lots.
p82
aVThat's 20 Central Parks.
p83
aVThat's enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants.
p84
aVWhy in the hell would they not okay this?
p85
aVGrowing one plant will give you 1,000, 10,000 seeds.
p86
aVWhen one dollar's worth of green beans
p87
aVwill give you 75 dollars' worth of produce.
p88
aVIt's my gospel, when I'm telling people, grow your own food.
p89
aVGrowing your own food is like printing your own money.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Applause)
p92
aa(lp93
VSee, I have a legacy in South Central.
p94
aVI grew up there. I raised my sons there.
p95
aVAnd I refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality
p96
aVthat was manufactured for me by some other people,
p97
aVand I'm manufacturing my own reality.
p98
aa(lp99
VSee, I'm an artist.
p100
aVGardening is my graffiti. I grow my art.
p101
aVJust like a graffiti artist, where they beautify walls,
p102
aVme, I beautify lawns, parkways.
p103
aVI use the garden, the soil, like it's a piece of cloth,
p104
aVand the plants and the trees,
p105
aVthat's my embellishment for that cloth.
p106
aVYou'd be surprised what the soil could do
p107
aVif you let it be your canvas.
p108
aVYou just couldn't imagine how amazing a sunflower is
p109
aVand how it affects people.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo what happened?
p112
aVI have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education,
p113
aVa tool for the transformation of my neighborhood.
p114
aVTo change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil.
p115
aVWe are the soil.
p116
aVYou'd be surprised how kids are affected by this.
p117
aVGardening is the most therapeutic
p118
aVand defiant act you can do,
p119
aVespecially in the inner city.
p120
aVPlus you get strawberries.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VI remember this time,
p125
aVthere was this mother and a daughter came,
p126
aVit was, like, 10:30 at night, and they were in my yard,
p127
aVand I came out and they looked so ashamed.
p128
aVSo I'm like, man, it made me feel bad that they were there,
p129
aVand I told them, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
p130
aVThis is on the street for a reason.
p131
aVIt made me feel ashamed to see people
p132
aVthat were this close to me that were hungry,
p133
aVand this only reinforced why I do this,
p134
aVand people asked me, "Fin, aren't you afraid
p135
aVpeople are going to steal your food?"
p136
aVAnd I'm like, "Hell no, I ain't afraid they're gonna steal it.
p137
aVThat's why it's on the street.
p138
aVThat's the whole idea.
p139
aVI want them to take it, but at the same time,
p140
aVI want them to take back their health."
p141
aa(lp142
VThere's another time when I put
p143
aVa garden in this homeless shelter in downtown Los Angeles.
p144
aVThese are the guys, they helped me unload the truck.
p145
aVIt was cool, and they just shared the stories
p146
aVabout how this affected them and how
p147
aVthey used to plant with their mother and their grandmother,
p148
aVand it was just cool to see how this changed them,
p149
aVif it was only for that one moment.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo Green Grounds has gone on to plant
p152
aVmaybe 20 gardens.
p153
aVWe've had, like, 50 people come to our dig-ins
p154
aVand participate, and it's all volunteers.
p155
aVIf kids grow kale, kids eat kale.
p156
aV(Laughter)
p157
aVIf they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes. (Applause)
p158
aVBut when none of this is presented to them,
p159
aVif they're not shown how food affects the mind and the body,
p160
aVthey blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them.
p161
aa(lp162
VI see young people
p163
aVand they want to work,
p164
aVbut they're in this thing where they're caught up \u2014
p165
aVI see kids of color and they're just on this track
p166
aVthat's designed for them,
p167
aVthat leads them to nowhere.
p168
aVSo with gardening, I see an opportunity
p169
aVwhere we can train these kids
p170
aVto take over their communities,
p171
aVto have a sustainable life.
p172
aVAnd when we do this, who knows?
p173
aVWe might produce the next George Washington Carver.
p174
aVbut if we don't change the composition of the soil,
p175
aVwe will never do this.
p176
aa(lp177
VNow this is one of my plans. This is what I want to do.
p178
aVI want to plant a whole block of gardens
p179
aVwhere people can share in the food in the same block.
p180
aVI want to take shipping containers
p181
aVand turn them into healthy cafes.
p182
aVNow don't get me wrong.
p183
aVI'm not talking about no free shit,
p184
aVbecause free is not sustainable.
p185
aVThe funny thing about sustainability,
p186
aVyou have to sustain it.
p187
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p188
aVWhat I'm talking about is putting people to work,
p189
aVand getting kids off the street, and letting them know
p190
aVthe joy, the pride and the honor in growing your own food,
p191
aVopening farmer's markets.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo what I want to do here,
p194
aVwe gotta make this sexy.
p195
aVSo I want us all to become ecolutionary renegades,
p196
aVgangstas, gangsta gardeners.
p197
aVWe gotta flip the script on what a gangsta is.
p198
aVIf you ain't a gardener, you ain't gangsta.
p199
aVGet gangsta with your shovel, okay?
p200
aVAnd let that be your weapon of choice.
p201
aa(lp202
V(Applause)
p203
aa(lp204
VSo basically, if you want to meet with me,
p205
aVyou know, if you want to meet,
p206
aVdon't call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs
p207
aVand have meetings where you talk about doing some shit \u2014
p208
aVwhere you talk about doing some shit.
p209
aVIf you want to meet with me, come to the garden
p210
aVwith your shovel so we can plant some shit.
p211
aa(lp212
VPeace. Thank you.
p213
aa(lp214
V(Applause)
p215
aVThank you. (Applause)

VLast year, I went on my first book tour.
p5
aVIn 13 months, I flew to 14 countries
p6
aVand gave some hundred talks.
p7
aVEvery talk in every country
p8
aVbegan with an introduction,
p9
aVand every introduction began, alas, with a lie:
p10
aV"Taiye Selasi comes from Ghana and Nigeria,"
p11
aVor "Taiye Selasi comes from England and the States."
p12
aVWhenever I heard this opening sentence,
p13
aVno matter the country that concluded it \u2014
p14
aVEngland, America, Ghana, Nigeria \u2014
p15
aVI thought, "But that's not true."
p16
aVYes, I was born in England and grew up in the United States.
p17
aVMy mum, born in England, and raised in Nigeria,
p18
aVcurrently lives in Ghana.
p19
aVMy father was born in Gold Coast, a British colony,
p20
aVraised in Ghana,
p21
aVand has lived for over 30 years in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
p22
aVFor this reason, my introducers also called me "multinational."
p23
aV"But Nike is multinational," I thought,
p24
aV"I'm a human being."
p25
aa(lp26
VThen, one fine day, mid-tour,
p27
aVI went to Louisiana, a museum in Denmark
p28
aVwhere I shared the stage with the writer Colum McCann.
p29
aVWe were discussing the role of locality in writing,
p30
aVwhen suddenly it hit me.
p31
aVI'm not multinational.
p32
aVI'm not a national at all.
p33
aVHow could I come from a nation?
p34
aVHow can a human being come from a concept?
p35
aVIt's a question that had been bothering me for going on two decades.
p36
aVFrom newspapers, textbooks, conversations,
p37
aVI had learned to speak of countries
p38
aVas if they were eternal, singular, naturally occurring things,
p39
aVbut I wondered:
p40
aVto say that I came from a country
p41
aVsuggested that the country was an absolute,
p42
aVsome fixed point in place in time,
p43
aVa constant thing, but was it?
p44
aVIn my lifetime, countries had disappeared \u2014 Czechoslovakia;
p45
aVappeared \u2014 Timor-Leste; failed \u2014 Somalia.
p46
aVMy parents came from countries that didn't exist when they were born.
p47
aVTo me, a country \u2014 this thing that could be born, die, expand, contract \u2014
p48
aVhardly seemed the basis for understanding a human being.
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd so it came as a huge relief to discover the sovereign state.
p51
aVWhat we call countries are actually
p52
aVvarious expressions of sovereign statehood,
p53
aVan idea that came into fashion only 400 years ago.
p54
aVWhen I learned this, beginning my masters degree in international relations,
p55
aVI felt a sort of surge of relief.
p56
aVIt was as I had suspected.
p57
aVHistory was real, cultures were real,
p58
aVbut countries were invented.
p59
aVFor the next 10 years, I sought to re- or un-define myself,
p60
aVmy world, my work, my experience,
p61
aVbeyond the logic of the state.
p62
aa(lp63
VIn 2005, I wrote an essay, "What is an Afropolitan,"
p64
aVsketching out an identity that privileged culture over country.
p65
aVIt was thrilling how many people could relate to my experience,
p66
aVand instructional how many others didn't buy my sense of self.
p67
aV"How can Selasi claim to come from Ghana," one such critic asked,
p68
aV"when she's never known the indignities
p69
aVof traveling abroad on a Ghanian passport?"
p70
aa(lp71
VNow, if I'm honest,
p72
aVI knew just what she meant.
p73
aVI've got a friend named Layla who was born and raised in Ghana.
p74
aVHer parents are third-generation Ghanians of Lebanese descent.
p75
aVLayla, who speaks fluent Twi, knows Accra like the back of her hand,
p76
aVbut when we first met years ago, I thought, "She's not from Ghana."
p77
aVIn my mind, she came from Lebanon,
p78
aVdespite the patent fact that all her formative experience
p79
aVtook place in suburban Accra.
p80
aVI, like my critics,
p81
aVwas imagining some Ghana where all Ghanaians had brown skin
p82
aVor none held U.K. passports.
p83
aVI'd fallen into the limiting trap
p84
aVthat the language of coming from countries sets \u2014
p85
aVthe privileging of a fiction, the singular country,
p86
aVover reality: human experience.
p87
aVSpeaking with Colum McCann that day, the penny finally dropped.
p88
aV"All experience is local," he said.
p89
aV"All identity is experience," I thought.
p90
aV"I'm not a national," I proclaimed onstage.
p91
aV"I'm a local. I'm multi-local."
p92
aa(lp93
VSee, "Taiye Selasi comes from the United States," isn't the truth.
p94
aVI have no relationship with the United States,
p95
aVall 50 of them, not really.
p96
aVMy relationship is with Brookline, the town where I grew up;
p97
aVwith New York City, where I started work;
p98
aVwith Lawrenceville, where I spend Thanksgiving.
p99
aVWhat makes America home for me is not my passport or accent,
p100
aVbut these very particular experiences
p101
aVand the places they occur.
p102
aVDespite my pride in Ewe culture,
p103
aVthe Black Stars, and my love of Ghanaian food,
p104
aVI've never had a relationship with the Republic of Ghana, writ large.
p105
aVMy relationship is with Accra, where my mother lives,
p106
aVwhere I go each year,
p107
aVwith the little garden in Dzorwulu where my father and I talk for hours.
p108
aVThese are the places that shape my experience.
p109
aVMy experience is where I'm from.
p110
aa(lp111
VWhat if we asked, instead of "Where are you from?" \u2014
p112
aV"Where are you a local?"
p113
aVThis would tell us so much more about who and how similar we are.
p114
aVTell me you're from France, and I see what, a set of clichés?
p115
aVAdichie's dangerous single story, the myth of the nation of France?
p116
aVTell me you're a local of Fez and Paris,
p117
aVbetter yet, Goutte d'Or, and I see a set of experiences.
p118
aVOur experience is where we're from.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo, where are you a local?
p121
aVI propose a three-step test.
p122
aVI call these the three "R\u2019s": rituals, relationships, restrictions.
p123
aa(lp124
VFirst, think of your daily rituals, whatever they may be:
p125
aVmaking your coffee, driving to work,
p126
aVharvesting your crops, saying your prayers.
p127
aVWhat kind of rituals are these?
p128
aVWhere do they occur?
p129
aVIn what city or cities in the world do shopkeepers know your face?
p130
aVAs a child, I carried out fairly standard suburban rituals in Boston,
p131
aVwith adjustments made for the rituals my mother brought from London and Lagos.
p132
aVWe took off our shoes in the house,
p133
aVwe were unfailingly polite with our elders,
p134
aVwe ate slow-cooked, spicy food.
p135
aVIn snowy North America, ours were rituals of the global South.
p136
aVThe first time I went to Delhi or to southern parts of Italy,
p137
aVI was shocked by how at home I felt.
p138
aVThe rituals were familiar.
p139
aV"R" number one, rituals.
p140
aa(lp141
VNow, think of your relationships, of the people who shape your days.
p142
aVTo whom do you speak at least once a week,
p143
aVbe it face to face or on FaceTime?
p144
aVBe reasonable in your assessment;
p145
aVI'm not talking about your Facebook friends.
p146
aVI'm speaking of the people who shape your weekly emotional experience.
p147
aVMy mother in Accra, my twin sister in Boston,
p148
aVmy best friends in New York:
p149
aVthese relationships are home for me.
p150
aV"R" number two, relationships.
p151
aa(lp152
VWe're local where we carry out our rituals and relationships,
p153
aVbut how we experience our locality
p154
aVdepends in part on our restrictions.
p155
aVBy restrictions, I mean, where are you able to live?
p156
aVWhat passport do you hold?
p157
aVAre you restricted by, say, racism, from feeling fully at home where you live?
p158
aVBy civil war, dysfunctional governance, economic inflation,
p159
aVfrom living in the locality where you had your rituals as a child?
p160
aVThis is the least sexy of the R\u2019s,
p161
aVless lyric than rituals and relationships,
p162
aVbut the question takes us past "Where are you now?"
p163
aVto "Why aren't you there, and why?"
p164
aVRituals, relationships, restrictions.
p165
aa(lp166
VTake a piece of paper
p167
aVand put those three words on top of three columns,
p168
aVthen try to fill those columns as honestly as you can.
p169
aVA very different picture of your life in local context,
p170
aVof your identity as a set of experiences,
p171
aVmay emerge.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo let's try it.
p174
aVI have a friend named Olu.
p175
aVHe's 35 years old.
p176
aVHis parents, born in Nigeria, came to Germany on scholarships.
p177
aVOlu was born in Nuremberg and lived there until age 10.
p178
aVWhen his family moved to Lagos, he studied in London,
p179
aVthen came to Berlin.
p180
aVHe loves going to Nigeria \u2014
p181
aVthe weather, the food, the friends \u2014
p182
aVbut hates the political corruption there.
p183
aVWhere is Olu from?
p184
aa(lp185
VI have another friend named Udo.
p186
aVHe's also 35 years old.
p187
aVUdo was born in Córdoba, in northwest Argentina,
p188
aVwhere his grandparents migrated from Germany, what is now Poland,
p189
aVafter the war.
p190
aVUdo studied in Buenos Aires, and nine years ago came to Berlin.
p191
aVHe loves going to Argentina \u2014  the weather, the food, the friends \u2014
p192
aVbut hates the economic corruption there.
p193
aVWhere is Udo from?
p194
aVWith his blonde hair and blue eyes, Udo could pass for German,
p195
aVbut holds an Argentinian passport, so needs a visa to live in Berlin.
p196
aVThat Udo is from Argentina has largely to do with history.
p197
aVThat he's a local of Buenos Aires and Berlin,
p198
aVthat has to do with life.
p199
aa(lp200
VOlu, who looks Nigerian, needs a visa to visit Nigeria.
p201
aVHe speaks Yoruba with an English accent,
p202
aVand English with a German one.
p203
aVTo claim that he's "not really Nigerian," though,
p204
aVdenies his experience in Lagos,
p205
aVthe rituals he practiced growing up,
p206
aVhis relationship with family and friends.
p207
aa(lp208
VMeanwhile, though Lagos is undoubtedly one of his homes,
p209
aVOlu always feels restricted there,
p210
aVnot least by the fact that he's gay.
p211
aa(lp212
VBoth he and Udo are restricted by the political conditions
p213
aVof their parents' countries,
p214
aVfrom living where some of their most meaningful rituals
p215
aVand relationships occur.
p216
aVTo say Olu is from Nigeria and Udo is from Argentina
p217
aVdistracts from their common experience.
p218
aVTheir rituals, their relationships, and their restrictions are the same.
p219
aa(lp220
VOf course, when we ask, "Where are you from?"
p221
aVwe're using a kind of shorthand.
p222
aVIt's quicker to say "Nigeria" than "Lagos and Berlin,"
p223
aVand as with Google Maps, we can always zoom in closer,
p224
aVfrom country to city to neighborhood.
p225
aVBut that's not quite the point.
p226
aVThe difference between "Where are you from?"
p227
aVand "Where are you a local?"
p228
aVisn't the specificity of the answer;
p229
aVit's the intention of the question.
p230
aVReplacing the language of nationality with the language of locality asks us
p231
aVto shift our focus to where real life occurs.
p232
aVEven that most glorious expression of countryhood, the World Cup,
p233
aVgives us national teams comprised mostly of multilocal players.
p234
aVAs a unit of measurement for human experience,
p235
aVthe country doesn't quite work.
p236
aVThat's why Olu says, "I'm German, but my parents come from Nigeria."
p237
aVThe "but" in that sentence belies the inflexibility of the units,
p238
aVone fixed and fictional entity bumping up against another.
p239
aV"I'm a local of Lagos and Berlin," suggests overlapping experiences,
p240
aVlayers that merge together, that can't be denied or removed.
p241
aVYou can take away my passport,
p242
aVbut you can't take away my experience.
p243
aVThat I carry within me.
p244
aVWhere I'm from comes wherever I go.
p245
aa(lp246
VTo be clear, I'm not suggesting that we do away with countries.
p247
aVThere's much to be said for national history,
p248
aVmore for the sovereign state.
p249
aVCulture exists in community, and community exists in context.
p250
aVGeography, tradition, collective memory: these things are important.
p251
aVWhat I'm questioning is primacy.
p252
aVAll of those introductions on tour began with reference to nation,
p253
aVas if knowing what country I came from would tell my audience who I was.
p254
aVWhat are we really seeking, though, when we ask where someone comes from?
p255
aVAnd what are we really seeing when we hear an answer?
p256
aa(lp257
VHere's one possibility:
p258
aVbasically, countries represent power.
p259
aV"Where are you from?" Mexico. Poland. Bangladesh. Less power.
p260
aVAmerica. Germany. Japan. More power.
p261
aVChina. Russia. Ambiguous.
p262
aa(lp263
V(Laughter)
p264
aa(lp265
VIt's possible that without realizing it, we're playing a power game,
p266
aVespecially in the context of multi-ethnic countries.
p267
aVAs any recent immigrant knows,
p268
aVthe question "Where are you from?" or "Where are you really from?"
p269
aVis often code for "Why are you here?"
p270
aa(lp271
VThen we have the scholar William Deresiewicz's writing
p272
aVof elite American colleges.
p273
aV"Students think that their environment is diverse
p274
aVif one comes from Missouri and another from Pakistan \u2014
p275
aVnever mind that all of their parents are doctors or bankers."
p276
aa(lp277
VI'm with him.
p278
aVTo call one student American, another Pakistani,
p279
aVthen triumphantly claim student body diversity
p280
aVignores the fact that these students are locals of the same milieu.
p281
aVThe same holds true on the other end of the economic spectrum.
p282
aVA Mexican gardener in Los Angeles and a Nepali housekeeper in Delhi
p283
aVhave more in common in terms of rituals and restrictions
p284
aVthan nationality implies.
p285
aa(lp286
VPerhaps my biggest problem with coming from countries
p287
aVis the myth of going back to them.
p288
aVI'm often asked if I plan to "go back" to Ghana.
p289
aVI go to Accra every year, but I can't "go back" to Ghana.
p290
aVIt's not because I wasn't born there.
p291
aVMy father can't go back, either.
p292
aVThe country in which he was born,
p293
aVthat country no longer exists.
p294
aVWe can never go back to a place and find it exactly where we left it.
p295
aVSomething, somewhere will always have changed,
p296
aVmost of all, ourselves.
p297
aVPeople.
p298
aa(lp299
VFinally, what we're talking about is human experience,
p300
aVthis notoriously and gloriously disorderly affair.
p301
aVIn creative writing, locality bespeaks humanity.
p302
aVThe more we know about where a story is set,
p303
aVthe more local color and texture,
p304
aVthe more human the characters start to feel,
p305
aVthe more relatable, not less.
p306
aVThe myth of national identity and the vocabulary of coming from
p307
aVconfuses us into placing ourselves into mutually exclusive categories.
p308
aVIn fact, all of us are multi \u2014 multi-local, multi-layered.
p309
aVTo begin our conversations with an acknowledgement of this complexity
p310
aVbrings us closer together, I think, not further apart.
p311
aVSo the next time that I'm introduced,
p312
aVI'd love to hear the truth:
p313
aV"Taiye Selasi is a human being, like everybody here.
p314
aVShe isn't a citizen of the world, but a citizen of worlds.
p315
aVShe is a local of New York, Rome and Accra."
p316
aa(lp317
VThank you.
p318
aa(lp319
V(Applause)

VI love trees, and I'm very lucky,
p5
aVbecause we live near a wonderful arboretum,
p6
aVand Sundays, usually, I'd go there with my wife
p7
aVand now, with my four-year-old,
p8
aVand we'd climb in the trees, we'd play hide and seek.
p9
aVThe second school I was at had big trees too,
p10
aVhad a fantastic tulip tree, I think it was the biggest in the country,
p11
aVand it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation
p12
aVaround it, around the playing fields.
p13
aa(lp14
VOne day I was grabbed by some of my classmates,
p15
aVand taken in the bushes \u2014 I was stripped; I was attacked;
p16
aVI was abused; and this came out of the blue.
p17
aVNow, the reason I say that, because, afterwards, I was thinking \u2014
p18
aVwell, I went back into the school \u2014 I felt dirty; I felt betrayed;
p19
aVI felt ashamed, but mainly \u2014 mainly, I felt powerless.
p20
aVAnd 30 years later I was sitting in an airplane,
p21
aVnext to a lady called Veronica, who came from Chile,
p22
aVand we were on a human rights tour,
p23
aVand she was starting to tell me what it was like to be tortured,
p24
aVand, from my very privileged position,
p25
aVthis was the only reference point that I had.
p26
aVAnd it was an amazing learning experience
p27
aVbecause, for me, human rights have been something in which I had,
p28
aVyou know, a part-time interest, but, mainly,
p29
aVit was something that happened to other people over there.
p30
aa(lp31
VBut I got a phone call from Bono in 1985 and, as you know,
p32
aVhe's a great singer, but he's a magnificent hustler, and \u2014
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter) \u2014
p35
aa(lp36
Va very hard guy to say no to, and he was saying,
p37
aVyou know, just after I'd done the Biko song,
p38
aVwe're going to do a tour for Amnesty,
p39
aVyou have to be on it, and really that was the first time
p40
aVthat I'd been out and started meeting people
p41
aVwho'd watched their family being shot in front of them,
p42
aVwho'd had a partner thrown out of an airplane into an ocean,
p43
aVand suddenly this world of human rights arrived in my world,
p44
aVand I couldn't really walk away in quite the same way as before.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo I got involved with this tour, which was for Amnesty,
p47
aVand then in '88 I took over Bono's job trying to learn how to hustle.
p48
aVI didn't do it as well, but we managed to get Youssou N'Dour, Sting,
p49
aVTracy Chapman, and Bruce Springsteen to go 'round the world for Amnesty,
p50
aVand it was an amazing experience.
p51
aVAnd, once again, I got an extraordinary education,
p52
aVand it was the first time, really,
p53
aVthat I'd met a lot of these people in the different countries,
p54
aVand these human rights stories became very physical,
p55
aVand, again, I couldn't really walk away quite so comfortably.
p56
aa(lp57
VBut the thing that really amazed me, that I had no idea,
p58
aVwas that you could suffer in this way
p59
aVand then have your whole experience, your story, denied,
p60
aVburied and forgotten.
p61
aVAnd it seemed that whenever there was a camera around,
p62
aVor a video or film camera,
p63
aVit was a great deal harder to do \u2014 for those in power to bury the story.
p64
aVAnd Reebok set up a foundation after these Human Rights Now tours
p65
aVand there was a decision then \u2014
p66
aVwell, we made a proposal, for a couple of years,
p67
aVabout trying to set up a division
p68
aVthat was going to give cameras to human rights activists.
p69
aVIt didn't really get anywhere,
p70
aVand then the Rodney King incident happened, and people thought,
p71
aVOK, if you have a camera in the right place at the right time,
p72
aVor, perhaps, the wrong time, depending who you are,
p73
aVthen you can actually start doing something,
p74
aVand campaigning, and being heard,
p75
aVand telling people about what's going on.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo, WITNESS was started in '92
p78
aVand it's since given cameras out in over 60 countries.
p79
aVAnd we campaign with activist groups
p80
aVand help them tell their story and, in fact,
p81
aVI will show you in a moment one of the most recent campaigns,
p82
aVand I'm afraid it's a story from Uganda,
p83
aVand, although we had a wonderful story from Uganda yesterday,
p84
aVthis one isn't quite so good.
p85
aVIn the north of Uganda,
p86
aVthere are something like 1.5 million internally displaced people,
p87
aVpeople who are not refugees in another country,
p88
aVbut because of the civil war, which has been going on for about 20 years,
p89
aVthey have nowhere to live.
p90
aVAnd 20,000 kids have been taken away to become child soldiers,
p91
aVand the International Criminal Court is going after five of the leaders of the \u2014
p92
aVnow, what's it called?
p93
aVI forget the name of the of the army \u2014
p94
aVit's Lord's Resistance Army, I believe \u2014
p95
aVbut the government, also, doesn't have a clean sheet,
p96
aVso if we could run the first video.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Music)
p99
aVWoman: Life in the camp is never simple. Even today life is difficult.
p100
aVWe stay because of the fear that what pushed us into the camp ...
p101
aVstill exists back home.
p102
aVText: "Between Two Fires: Torture and Displacement in Northern Uganda"
p103
aVMan: When we were at home, it was Kony's [rebel] soldiers disturbing us.
p104
aVAt first, we were safe in the camp.
p105
aVBut later the government soldiers began mistreating us a lot.
p106
aa(lp107
V(Chanting)
p108
aVJennifer: A soldier walked onto the road, asking where we'd been.
p109
aVEvelyn and I hid behind my mother.
p110
aVEvelyn: He ordered us to sit down, so we sat down.
p111
aVThe other soldier also came.
p112
aVJennifer: The man came and started undressing me.
p113
aVThe other one carried Evelyn aside.
p114
aVThe one who was defiling me then left me and went to rape Evelyn.
p115
aVAnd the one who was raping Evelyn came and defiled me also.
p116
aVMan: The soldiers with clubs this long beat us to get a confession.
p117
aVThey kept telling us, "Tell the truth!" as they beat us.
p118
aVWoman: They insisted that I was lying.
p119
aVAt that moment, they fired and shot off my fingers.
p120
aVI fell. They ran to join the others ... leaving me for dead.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Music)
p123
aVText: Uganda ratified the Convention Against Torture in 1986.
p124
aVTorture is defined as any act by which severe pain of suffering,
p125
aVwhether physical or mental,
p126
aVis intentionally inflicted by a person acting in an official capacity
p127
aVto obtain information or a confession, to punish, coerce or intimidate.
p128
aa(lp129
VPeter Gabriel: So torture is not something that always happens on other soil.
p130
aVIn my country, it was \u2014
p131
aVwe had been looking at pictures of British soldiers beating up young Iraqis;
p132
aVwe've got Abu Ghraib; we've got Guantanamo Bay.
p133
aVI had a driver on my way to Newark Airport,
p134
aVand he told me a story that, in the middle of the night, 4 a.m.,
p135
aVhe'd been taken out of his home in Queens \u2014 taken to a place in the Midwest,
p136
aVthat he was interrogated and tortured
p137
aVand returned to the street four weeks later,
p138
aVbecause he had the same \u2014 he was Middle Eastern,
p139
aVand he had the same name as one of the 9/11 pilots,
p140
aVand that may or may not be true \u2014
p141
aVI didn't think he was a liar, though.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd, I think, if we look around the world,
p144
aVas well as the polar ice caps melting,
p145
aVhuman rights, which have been fought for,
p146
aVfor many hundreds of years in some cases,
p147
aVare, also, eroding very fast,
p148
aVand that is something that we need to take a look at
p149
aVand, maybe, start campaigning for.
p150
aVI mean, here, too, one of our partners was at Van Jones
p151
aVand the Books Not Bars project \u2014 they have managed,
p152
aVwith their footage in California
p153
aVto change the youth correction systems employed,
p154
aVand it's much \u2014 much \u2014 I think, more humane methods
p155
aVare being looked at, how you should lock up young kids,
p156
aVand that's questionable to start off.
p157
aVAnd as the story of Mr. Morales, just down the road,
p158
aVexcuse me, Mr. Gabriel,
p159
aVwould you mind if we delayed your execution a little bit?
p160
aVNo, not at all, no problem, take your time.
p161
aVBut this, surely, whoever that man is, whatever he's done,
p162
aVthis is cruel and unusual punishment.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnyway, WITNESS has been trying to arm the brave people
p165
aVwho often put their lives at risk around the world, with cameras,
p166
aVand I'd like to show you just a little more of that. Thank you.
p167
aa(lp168
V(Thunder) Text: You can say a story is fabricated.
p169
aa(lp170
V(Music)
p171
aVText: You can say a jury is corrupt.
p172
aVYou can say a person is lying.
p173
aVYou can say you don't trust newspapers.
p174
aVBut you can't say
p175
aVwhat you just saw
p176
aVnever happened.
p177
aVHelp WITNESS give cameras to the world.
p178
aVShoot a video;
p179
aVexpose injustice;
p180
aVreveal the truth;
p181
aVshow us what's wrong with the world;
p182
aVand maybe
p183
aVwe can help
p184
aVmake it
p185
aVright.
p186
aVWITNESS.
p187
aVAll the video you have just seen was recorded by
p188
aVhuman rights groups working with WITNESS.
p189
aa(lp190
V(Applause)
p191
aa(lp192
VPG: WITNESS was born of technological innovation \u2014
p193
aVin a sense the small, portable, DV cam
p194
aVwas really what allowed it to come into being.
p195
aVAnd we've also been trying to get computers out to the world,
p196
aVso that groups can communicate much more effectively,
p197
aVcampaign much more effectively,
p198
aVbut now we have the wonderful possibility,
p199
aVwhich is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it,
p200
aVbecause that is cheap; it's ubiquitous; and it's moving fast
p201
aVall around the world \u2014 and it's very exciting for us.
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd so, the dream is that we could have a world
p204
aVin which anyone who has anything bad happen to them of this sort
p205
aVhas a chance of getting their story uploaded,
p206
aVbeing seen, being watched,
p207
aVthat they really know that they can be heard,
p208
aVthat there would be a giant website,
p209
aVmaybe, a little like Google Earth,
p210
aVand you could fly over and find out the realities of what's going,
p211
aVfor the world's inhabitants. In a way
p212
aVwhat this technology is allowing is, really,
p213
aVthat a lot of the problems of the world can have a human face,
p214
aVthat we can actually see who's dying of AIDS
p215
aVor who's being beaten up, for the first time,
p216
aVand we can hear their stories in a way that the blogger culture \u2014
p217
aVif we can move that into these sort of fields,
p218
aVI think we can really transform the world in all sorts of ways.
p219
aVThere could be a new movement growing up,
p220
aVrising from the ground, reaching for the light,
p221
aVand growing strong, just like a tree. Thank you.

VYou may not know this,
p5
aVbut you are celebrating an anniversary with me.
p6
aVI'm not married,
p7
aVbut one year ago today,
p8
aVI woke up
p9
aVfrom a month-long coma,
p10
aVfollowing a double lung transplant.
p11
aVCrazy, I know. Insane.
p12
aVThank you.
p13
aa(lp14
VSix years before that,
p15
aVI was starting my career
p16
aVas an opera singer in Europe,
p17
aVwhen I was diagnosed with
p18
aVidiopathic pulmonary hypertension \u2014
p19
aValso known as PH.
p20
aVIt happens when there's a thickening
p21
aVin the pulmonary veins,
p22
aVmaking the right side of the heart
p23
aVwork overtime,
p24
aVand causing what I call
p25
aVthe reverse-Grinch effect.
p26
aVMy heart was three-and-a-half sizes
p27
aVtoo big.
p28
aVPhysical activity becomes very difficult
p29
aVfor people with this condition,
p30
aVand usually after two to five years,
p31
aVyou die.
p32
aVI went to see this specialist,
p33
aVand she was top-of-the-field
p34
aVand told me I had to stop singing.
p35
aVShe said, "Those high notes are going to kill you."
p36
aVWhile she didn't have any medical evidence
p37
aVto back up her claim
p38
aVthat there was a relationship
p39
aVbetween operatic arias
p40
aVand pulmonary hypertension,
p41
aVshe was absolutely emphatic
p42
aVI was singing my own obituary.
p43
aVI was very limited by my condition, physically.
p44
aVBut I was not limited when I sang,
p45
aVand as air came up from my lungs,
p46
aVthrough my vocal cords
p47
aVand passed my lips as sound,
p48
aVit was the closest thing I had ever come
p49
aVto transcendence.
p50
aVAnd just because of someone's hunch,
p51
aVI wasn't going to give it up.
p52
aa(lp53
VThankfully, I met Reda Girgis,
p54
aVwho is dry as toast,
p55
aVbut he and his team at Johns Hopkins
p56
aVdidn't just want me to survive,
p57
aVthey wanted me
p58
aVto live a meaningful life.
p59
aVThis meant making trade-offs.
p60
aVI come from Colorado.
p61
aVIt's a mile high,
p62
aVand I grew up there with my 10 brothers and sisters
p63
aVand two adoring parents.
p64
aVWell, the altitude exacerbated my symptoms.
p65
aVSo I moved to Baltimore to be near my doctors
p66
aVand enrolled in a conservatory nearby.
p67
aVI couldn't walk as much as I used to,
p68
aVso I opted for five-inch heels.
p69
aVAnd I gave up salt,
p70
aVI went vegan,
p71
aVand I started taking huge doses of
p72
aVsildenafil,
p73
aValso known as Viagra.
p74
aa(lp75
V(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VMy father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing
p78
aVin alternative or traditional therapies
p79
aVfor PH,
p80
aVbut after six months,
p81
aVI couldn't walk up a small hill. I couldn't climb a flight of stairs.
p82
aVI could barely stand up
p83
aVwithout feeling like I was going to faint.
p84
aVI had a heart catheterization,
p85
aVwhere they measure this internal arterial pulmonary pressure,
p86
aVwhich is supposed to be between 15 and 20.
p87
aVMine was 146.
p88
aVI like to do things big,
p89
aVand it meant one thing:
p90
aVthere is a big gun treatment
p91
aVfor pulmonary hypertension called Flolan,
p92
aVand it's not just a drug;
p93
aVit's a way of life.
p94
aVDoctors insert a catheter into your chest,
p95
aVwhich is attached to a pump
p96
aVthat weighs about four-and-a-half pounds.
p97
aVEvery day, 24 hours, that pump is at your side,
p98
aVadministering medicine
p99
aVdirectly to your heart,
p100
aVand it's not
p101
aVa particularly preferable
p102
aVmedicine in many senses.
p103
aVThis is a list of the side effects:
p104
aVif you eat too much salt,
p105
aVlike a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,
p106
aVyou'll probably end up in the ICU.
p107
aVIf you go through a metal detector,
p108
aVyou'll probably die.
p109
aVIf you get a bubble in your medicine \u2014
p110
aVbecause you have to mix it every morning \u2014
p111
aVand it stays in there,
p112
aVyou probably die.
p113
aVIf you run out of medicine, you definitely die.
p114
aa(lp115
VNo one wants to go on Flolan.
p116
aVBut when I needed it,
p117
aVit was a godsend.
p118
aVWithin a few days, I could walk again.
p119
aVWithin a few weeks, I was performing,
p120
aVand in a few months,
p121
aVI debuted at the Kennedy Center.
p122
aVThe pump was a little bit problematic when performing,
p123
aVso I'd attach it to my inner thigh
p124
aVwith the help of the girdle and an ACE bandage.
p125
aVLiterally hundreds of elevator rides
p126
aVwere spent with me alone
p127
aVstuffing the pump into my Spanx,
p128
aVhoping the doors wouldn't open unexpectedly.
p129
aVAnd the tubing coming out of my chest
p130
aVwas a nightmare for costume designers.
p131
aVI graduated from graduate school in 2006,
p132
aVand I got a fellowship to go back to Europe.
p133
aVA few days after arriving,
p134
aVI met this wonderful, old conductor
p135
aVwho started casting me in all of these roles.
p136
aVAnd before long, I was commuting
p137
aVbetween Budapest, Milan
p138
aVand Florence.
p139
aVThough I was attached
p140
aVto this ugly, unwanted,
p141
aVhigh-maintenance, mechanical pet,
p142
aVmy life was kind of like the happy part in an opera \u2014
p143
aVvery complicated,
p144
aVbut in a good way.
p145
aa(lp146
VThen in February
p147
aVof 2008,
p148
aVmy grandfather passed away.
p149
aVHe was a big figure in all of our lives,
p150
aVand we loved him very much.
p151
aVIt certainly didn't prepare me
p152
aVfor what came next.
p153
aVSeven weeks later,
p154
aVI got a call from my family.
p155
aVMy father had been in a catastrophic car accident,
p156
aVand he died.
p157
aVAt 24, my death would have been
p158
aVentirely expected.
p159
aVBut his \u2014
p160
aVwell, the only way I can articulate how it felt
p161
aVwas that it precipitated
p162
aVmy medical decline.
p163
aVAgainst my doctors' and family's wishes,
p164
aVI needed to go back for the funeral.
p165
aVI had to say goodbye
p166
aVin some way, shape or form.
p167
aVBut soon I was showing signs of right-heart failure,
p168
aVand I had to return to sea level,
p169
aVdoing so knowing
p170
aVthat I probably would never see my home again.
p171
aa(lp172
VI canceled most of my engagements that summer,
p173
aVbut I had one left in Tel Aviv, so I went.
p174
aVAfter one performance,
p175
aVI could barely drag myself
p176
aVfrom the stage to the taxicab.
p177
aVI sat down and felt the blood
p178
aVrush down from my face,
p179
aVand in the heat of the desert,
p180
aVI was freezing cold.
p181
aVMy fingers started turning blue,
p182
aVand I was like, "What is going on here?"
p183
aVI heard my heart's valves
p184
aVsnapping open and closed.
p185
aVThe cab stopped,
p186
aVand I pulled my body from it
p187
aVfeeling each ounce of weight
p188
aVas I walked to the elevator.
p189
aVI fell through my apartment door
p190
aVand crawled to the bathroom
p191
aVwhere I found my problem:
p192
aVI had forgotten to mix in
p193
aVthe most important part of my medicine.
p194
aVI was dying,
p195
aVand if I didn't mix that stuff up fast,
p196
aVI would never leave that apartment alive.
p197
aVI started mixing,
p198
aVand I felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole or another,
p199
aVbut I just kept on going.
p200
aVFinally, with the last bottle in and the last bubble out,
p201
aVI attached the pump to the tubing
p202
aVand lay there hoping it would kick in
p203
aVsoon enough.
p204
aVIf it didn't, I'd probably see my father
p205
aVsooner than I anticipated.
p206
aVThankfully, in a few minutes,
p207
aVI saw the signature hive-like rash
p208
aVappear on my legs,
p209
aVwhich is a side effect of the medication,
p210
aVand I knew I'd be okay.
p211
aa(lp212
VWe're not big on fear in my family,
p213
aVbut I was scared.
p214
aVI went back to the States,
p215
aVanticipating I'd return to Europe,
p216
aVbut the heart catheterization
p217
aVshowed that I wasn't going anywhere
p218
aVfurther that a flight-for-life from Johns Hopkins Hospital.
p219
aVI performed here and there,
p220
aVbut as my condition deteriorated,
p221
aVso did my voice.
p222
aVMy doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transplant.
p223
aVI didn't.
p224
aVI had two friends who had recently died
p225
aVmonths after having very challenging surgeries.
p226
aVI knew another young man, though, who had PH
p227
aVwho died while waiting for one.
p228
aVI wanted to live.
p229
aVI thought stem cells were a good option,
p230
aVbut they hadn't developed to a point
p231
aVwhere I could take advantage of them yet.
p232
aVI officially took a break from singing,
p233
aVand I went to the Cleveland Clinic
p234
aVto be reevaluated
p235
aVfor the third time in five years, for transplant.
p236
aVI was sitting there kind of unenthusiastically talking
p237
aVwith the head transplant surgeon,
p238
aVand I asked him if I needed a transplant,
p239
aVwhat I could do to prepare.
p240
aVHe said, "Be happy.
p241
aVA happy patient
p242
aVis a healthy patient."
p243
aVIt was like in one verbal swoop
p244
aVhe had channeled my thoughts
p245
aVon life and medicine
p246
aVand Confucius.
p247
aVI still didn't want a transplant,
p248
aVbut in a month,
p249
aVI was back in the hospital
p250
aVwith some severely edemic kankles \u2014
p251
aVvery attractive.
p252
aVAnd it was right-heart failure.
p253
aa(lp254
VI finally decided
p255
aVit was time to take my doctor's advice.
p256
aVIt was time for me to go to Cleveland
p257
aVand to start the agonizing wait
p258
aVfor a match.
p259
aVBut the next morning,
p260
aVwhile I was still in the hospital,
p261
aVI got a telephone call.
p262
aVIt was my doctor in Cleveland,
p263
aVMarie Budev.
p264
aVAnd they had lungs.
p265
aVIt was a match.
p266
aVThey were from Texas.
p267
aVAnd everybody was really happy for me,
p268
aVbut me.
p269
aVBecause, despite their problems,
p270
aVI had spent my whole life training my lungs,
p271
aVand I was not particularly enthusiastic
p272
aVabout giving them up.
p273
aVI flew to Cleveland,
p274
aVand my family rushed there
p275
aVin hopes that they would meet me
p276
aVand say what we knew
p277
aVmight be our final goodbye.
p278
aVBut organs don't wait,
p279
aVand I went into surgery
p280
aVbefore I could say goodbye.
p281
aVThe last thing I remember
p282
aVwas lying on a white blanket,
p283
aVtelling my surgeon that I needed to see my mother again,
p284
aVand to please try and save my voice.
p285
aVI fell into this apocalyptic dream world.
p286
aa(lp287
VDuring the thirteen-and-a-half-hour surgery,
p288
aVI flatlined twice,
p289
aV40 quarts of blood
p290
aVwere infused into my body.
p291
aVAnd in my surgeon's 20-year career,
p292
aVhe said it was among the most difficult transplants
p293
aVthat he's ever performed.
p294
aVThey left my chest open for two weeks.
p295
aVYou could see my over-sized heart
p296
aVbeating inside of it.
p297
aVI was on a dozen machines
p298
aVthat were keeping me alive.
p299
aVAn infection ravaged my skin.
p300
aVI had hoped my voice would be saved,
p301
aVbut my doctors knew
p302
aVthat the breathing tubes going down my throat
p303
aVmight have already destroyed it.
p304
aVIf they stayed in, there was no way I would ever sing again.
p305
aVSo my doctor got the ENT,
p306
aVthe top guy at the clinic, to come down
p307
aVand give me surgery
p308
aVto move the tubes around my voice box.
p309
aVHe said it would kill me.
p310
aVSo my own surgeon performed the procedure
p311
aVin a last-ditch attempt to save my voice.
p312
aa(lp313
VThough my mom couldn't say goodbye to me
p314
aVbefore the surgery,
p315
aVshe didn't leave my side
p316
aVin the months of recovery that followed.
p317
aVAnd if you want an example
p318
aVof perseverance,
p319
aVgrit and strength
p320
aVin a beautiful, little package,
p321
aVit is her.
p322
aVOne year ago
p323
aVto this very day,
p324
aVI woke up.
p325
aVI was 95 lbs.
p326
aVThere were a dozen tubes
p327
aVcoming in and out of my body.
p328
aVI couldn't walk, I couldn't talk,
p329
aVI couldn't eat, I couldn't move,
p330
aVI certainly couldn't sing,
p331
aVI couldn't even breathe,
p332
aVbut when I looked up
p333
aVand I saw my mother,
p334
aVI couldn't help but smile.
p335
aa(lp336
VWhether by a Mack truck
p337
aVor by heart failure
p338
aVor faulty lungs,
p339
aVdeath happens.
p340
aVBut life isn't really just about avoiding death, is it?
p341
aVIt's about living.
p342
aVMedical conditions don't negate the human condition.
p343
aVAnd when people are allowed
p344
aVto pursue their passions,
p345
aVdoctors will find they have better,
p346
aVhappier and healthier patients.
p347
aVMy parents were totally stressed out
p348
aVabout me going and auditioning
p349
aVand traveling and performing all over the place,
p350
aVbut they knew that it was much better for me to do that
p351
aVthan be preoccupied with my own mortality all of the time.
p352
aVAnd I'm so grateful they did.
p353
aa(lp354
VThis past summer, when I was running and singing
p355
aVand dancing and playing with my nieces and my nephews
p356
aVand my brothers and my sisters and my mother and my grandmother
p357
aVin the Colorado Rockies,
p358
aVI couldn't help but think of that doctor
p359
aVwho told me that I couldn't sing.
p360
aVAnd I wanted to tell her,
p361
aVand I want to tell you,
p362
aVwe need to stop letting disease
p363
aVdivorce us from our dreams.
p364
aVWhen we do,
p365
aVwe will find that patients
p366
aVdon't just survive;
p367
aVwe thrive.
p368
aVAnd some of us
p369
aVmight even sing.
p370
aa(lp371
V(Applause)
p372
aV[Singing: French]
p373
aa(lp374
VThank you.
p375
aV(Applause)
p376
aVThank you.
p377
aVAnd I'd like to thank my pianist, Monica Lee.
p378
aV(Applause)
p379
aVThank you so much.
p380
aVThank you.

VThank you so much. I'm going to try to take you
p5
aVon a journey of the underwater acoustic world
p6
aVof whales and dolphins.
p7
aVSince we are such a visual species,
p8
aVit's hard for us to really understand this,
p9
aVso I'll use a mixture of figures and sounds
p10
aVand hope this can communicate it.
p11
aVBut let's also think, as a visual species,
p12
aVwhat it's like when we go snorkeling or diving
p13
aVand try to look underwater.
p14
aVWe really can't see very far.
p15
aVOur vision, which works so well in air,
p16
aVall of a sudden is very restricted and claustrophobic.
p17
aVAnd what marine mammals have evolved
p18
aVover the last tens of millions of years
p19
aVis ways to depend on sound
p20
aVto both explore their world
p21
aVand also to stay in touch with one another.
p22
aa(lp23
VDolphins and toothed whales use echolocation.
p24
aVThey can produce loud clicks
p25
aVand listen for echoes from the sea floor in order to orient.
p26
aVThey can listen for echoes from prey
p27
aVin order to decide where food is
p28
aVand to decide which one they want to eat.
p29
aVAll marine mammals use sound for communication to stay in touch.
p30
aVSo the large baleen whales
p31
aVwill produce long, beautiful songs,
p32
aVwhich are used in reproductive advertisement
p33
aVfor male and females, both to find one another
p34
aVand to select a mate.
p35
aVAnd mother and young and closely bonded animals
p36
aVuse calls to stay in touch with one another,
p37
aVso sound is really critical for their lives.
p38
aa(lp39
VThe first thing that got me interested in the sounds
p40
aVof these underwater animals,
p41
aVwhose world was so foreign to me,
p42
aVwas evidence from captive dolphins
p43
aVthat captive dolphins could imitate human sounds.
p44
aVAnd I mentioned I'll use
p45
aVsome visual representations of sounds.
p46
aVHere's the first example.
p47
aVThis is a plot of frequency against time \u2014
p48
aVsort of like musical notation,
p49
aVwhere the higher notes are up higher and the lower notes are lower,
p50
aVand time goes this way.
p51
aVThis is a picture of a trainer's whistle,
p52
aVa whistle a trainer will blow to tell a dolphin
p53
aVit's done the right thing and can come get a fish.
p54
aVIt sounds sort of like "tweeeeeet." Like that.
p55
aVThis is a calf in captivity
p56
aVmaking an imitation
p57
aVof that trainer's whistle.
p58
aVIf you hummed this tune to your dog or cat
p59
aVand it hummed it back to you,
p60
aVyou ought to be pretty surprised.
p61
aVVery few nonhuman mammals
p62
aVcan imitate sounds.
p63
aVIt's really important for our music and our language.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo it's a puzzle: The few other mammal groups that do this,
p66
aVwhy do they do it?
p67
aVA lot of my career has been devoted
p68
aVto trying to understand
p69
aVhow these animals use their learning,
p70
aVuse the ability to change what you say
p71
aVbased on what you hear
p72
aVin their own communication systems.
p73
aVSo let's start with calls of a nonhuman primate.
p74
aVMany mammals have to produce contact calls
p75
aVwhen, say, a mother and calf are apart.
p76
aVThis is an example of a call produced by squirrel monkeys
p77
aVwhen they're isolated from another one.
p78
aVAnd you can see, there's not much
p79
aVvariability in these calls.
p80
aVBy contrast, the signature whistle
p81
aVwhich dolphins use to stay in touch,
p82
aVeach individual here has a radically different call.
p83
aVThey can use this ability to learn calls
p84
aVin order to develop more complicated and more distinctive calls
p85
aVto identify individuals.
p86
aa(lp87
VHow about the setting in which animals need to use this call?
p88
aVWell let's look at mothers and calves.
p89
aVIn normal life for mother and calf dolphin,
p90
aVthey'll often drift apart or swim apart if Mom is chasing a fish,
p91
aVand when they separate
p92
aVthey have to get back together again.
p93
aVWhat this figure shows is the percentage of the separations
p94
aVin which dolphins whistle,
p95
aVagainst the maximum distance.
p96
aVSo when dolphins are separating by less than 20 meters,
p97
aVless than half the time they need to use whistles.
p98
aVMost of the time they can just find each other
p99
aVjust by swimming around.
p100
aVBut all of the time when they separate by more than 100 meters,
p101
aVthey need to use these individually distinctive whistles
p102
aVto come back together again.
p103
aVMost of these distinctive signature whistles
p104
aVare quite stereotyped and stable
p105
aVthrough the life of a dolphin.
p106
aVBut there are some exceptions.
p107
aa(lp108
VWhen a male dolphin leaves Mom,
p109
aVit will often join up with another male
p110
aVand form an alliance, which may last for decades.
p111
aVAs these two animals form a social bond,
p112
aVtheir distinctive whistles actually converge
p113
aVand become very similar.
p114
aVThis plot shows two members of a pair.
p115
aVAs you can see at the top here,
p116
aVthey share an up-sweep, like "woop, woop, woop."
p117
aVThey both have that kind of up-sweep.
p118
aVWhereas these members of a pair go "wo-ot, wo-ot, wo-ot."
p119
aVAnd what's happened is
p120
aVthey've used this learning process
p121
aVto develop a new sign that identifies this new social group.
p122
aVIt's a very interesting way that they can
p123
aVform a new identifier
p124
aVfor the new social group that they've had.
p125
aa(lp126
VLet's now take a step back
p127
aVand see what this message can tell us
p128
aVabout protecting dolphins
p129
aVfrom human disturbance.
p130
aVAnybody looking at this picture
p131
aVwill know this dolphin is surrounded,
p132
aVand clearly his behavior is being disrupted.
p133
aVThis is a bad situation.
p134
aVBut it turns out that when just a single boat
p135
aVis approaching a group of dolphins
p136
aVat a couple hundred meters away,
p137
aVthe dolphins will start whistling,
p138
aVthey'll change what they're doing, they'll have a more cohesive group,
p139
aVwait for the boat to go by,
p140
aVand then they'll get back to normal business.
p141
aVWell, in a place like Sarasota, Florida,
p142
aVthe average interval between times
p143
aVthat a boat is passing within a hundred meters of a dolphin group
p144
aVis six minutes.
p145
aVSo even in the situation that doesn't look as bad as this,
p146
aVit's still affecting the amount of time these animals have
p147
aVto do their normal work.
p148
aa(lp149
VAnd if we look at a very pristine environment like western Australia,
p150
aVLars Bider has done work
p151
aVcomparing dolphin behavior and distribution
p152
aVbefore there were dolphin-watching boats.
p153
aVWhen there was one boat, not much of an impact.
p154
aVAnd two boats: When the second boat was added,
p155
aVwhat happened was that some of the dolphins
p156
aVleft the area completely.
p157
aVOf the ones that stayed, their reproductive rate declined.
p158
aVSo it could have a negative impact on the whole population.
p159
aVWhen we think of marine-protected areas for animals like dolphins,
p160
aVthis means that we have to be
p161
aVquite conscious about activities that we thought were benign.
p162
aVWe may need to regulate the intensity
p163
aVof recreational boating and actual whale watching
p164
aVin order to prevent these kinds of problems.
p165
aVI'd also like to point out that sound
p166
aVdoesn't obey boundaries.
p167
aVSo you can draw a line to try to protect an area,
p168
aVbut chemical pollution and noise pollution
p169
aVwill continue to move through the area.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd I'd like to switch now from this local,
p172
aVfamiliar, coastal environment
p173
aVto a much broader world of the baleen whales and the open ocean.
p174
aVThis is a kind of map we've all been looking at.
p175
aVThe world is mostly blue.
p176
aVBut I'd also like to point out that the oceans
p177
aVare much more connected than we think.
p178
aVNotice how few barriers there are to movement
p179
aVacross all of the oceans compared to land.
p180
aVTo me, the most mind-bending example
p181
aVof the interconnectedness of the ocean
p182
aVcomes from an acoustic experiment
p183
aVwhere oceanographers
p184
aVtook a ship to the southern Indian Ocean,
p185
aVdeployed an underwater loudspeaker
p186
aVand played back a sound.
p187
aVThat same sound
p188
aVtraveled to the west, and could be heard in Bermuda,
p189
aVand traveled to the east, and could be heard in Monterey \u2014
p190
aVthe same sound.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo we live in a world of satellite communication,
p193
aVare used to global communication,
p194
aVbut it's still amazing to me.
p195
aVThe ocean has properties
p196
aVthat allow low-frequency sound
p197
aVto basically move globally.
p198
aVThe acoustic transit time for each of these paths is about three hours.
p199
aVIt's nearly halfway around the globe.
p200
aVIn the early '70s,
p201
aVRoger Payne and an ocean acoustician
p202
aVpublished a theoretical paper
p203
aVpointing out that it was possible
p204
aVthat sound could transmit over these large areas,
p205
aVbut very few biologists believed it.
p206
aa(lp207
VIt actually turns out, though,
p208
aVeven though we've only known of long-range propagation for a few decades,
p209
aVthe whales clearly have evolved,
p210
aVover tens of millions of years,
p211
aVa way to exploit this amazing property of the ocean.
p212
aVSo blue whales and fin whales
p213
aVproduce very low-frequency sounds
p214
aVthat can travel over very long ranges.
p215
aVThe top plot here shows
p216
aVa complicated series of calls
p217
aVthat are repeated by males.
p218
aVThey form songs, and they appear to play a role in reproduction,
p219
aVsort of like that of song birds.
p220
aVDown below here, we see calls made by both males and females
p221
aVthat also carry over very long ranges.
p222
aa(lp223
VThe biologists continued to be skeptical
p224
aVof the long-range communication issue
p225
aVwell past the '70s,
p226
aVuntil the end of the Cold War.
p227
aVWhat happened was, during the Cold War,
p228
aVthe U.S. Navy had a system that was secret at the time,
p229
aVthat they used to track Russian submarines.
p230
aVIt had deep underwater microphones, or hydrophones,
p231
aVcabled to shore,
p232
aVall wired back to a central place that could listen
p233
aVto sounds over the whole North Atlantic.
p234
aVAnd after the Berlin Wall fell, the Navy made these systems available
p235
aVto whale bio-acousticians
p236
aVto see what they could hear.
p237
aa(lp238
VThis is a plot from Christopher Clark
p239
aVwho tracked one individual blue whale
p240
aVas it passed by Bermuda,
p241
aVwent down to the latitude of Miami and came back again.
p242
aVIt was tracked for 43 days,
p243
aVswimming 1,700 kilometers,
p244
aVor more than 1,000 miles.
p245
aVThis shows us both that the calls
p246
aVare detectable over hundreds of miles
p247
aVand that whales routinely swim hundreds of miles.
p248
aVThey're ocean-based and scale animals
p249
aVwho are communicating over much longer ranges
p250
aVthan we had anticipated.
p251
aa(lp252
VUnlike fins and blues, which
p253
aVdisperse into the temperate and tropical oceans,
p254
aVthe humpbacked whales congregate
p255
aVin local traditional breeding grounds,
p256
aVso they can make a sound that's a little higher in frequency,
p257
aVbroader-band and more complicated.
p258
aVSo you're listening to the complicated song
p259
aVproduced by humpbacks here.
p260
aVHumpbacks, when they develop
p261
aVthe ability to sing this song,
p262
aVthey're listening to other whales
p263
aVand modifying what they sing based on what they're hearing,
p264
aVjust like song birds or the dolphin whistles I described.
p265
aVThis means that humpback song
p266
aVis a form of animal culture,
p267
aVjust like music for humans would be.
p268
aa(lp269
VI think one of the most interesting examples of this
p270
aVcomes from Australia.
p271
aVBiologists on the east coast of Australia
p272
aVwere recording the songs of humpbacks in that area.
p273
aVAnd this orange line here marks the typical songs
p274
aVof east coast humpbacks.
p275
aVIn '95 they all sang the normal song.
p276
aVBut in '96 they heard a few weird songs,
p277
aVand it turned out that these strange songs
p278
aVwere typical of west coast whales.
p279
aVThe west coast calls became more and more popular,
p280
aVuntil by 1998,
p281
aVnone of the whales sang the east coast song; it was completely gone.
p282
aVThey just sang the cool new west coast song.
p283
aVIt's as if some new hit style
p284
aVhad completely wiped out
p285
aVthe old-fashioned style before,
p286
aVand with no golden oldies stations.
p287
aVNobody sang the old ones.
p288
aa(lp289
VI'd like to briefly just show what the ocean does to these calls.
p290
aVNow you are listening to a recording made by Chris Clark,
p291
aV0.2 miles away from a humpback.
p292
aVYou can hear the full frequency range. It's quite loud.
p293
aVYou sound very nearby.
p294
aVThe next recording you're going to hear
p295
aVwas made of the same humpback song
p296
aV50 miles away.
p297
aVThat's shown down here.
p298
aVYou only hear the low frequencies.
p299
aVYou hear the reverberation
p300
aVas the sound travels over long-range in the ocean
p301
aVand is not quite as loud.
p302
aVNow after I play back these humpback calls,
p303
aVI'll play blue whale calls, but they have to be sped up
p304
aVbecause they're so low in frequency
p305
aVthat you wouldn't be able to hear it otherwise.
p306
aVHere's a blue whale call at 50 miles,
p307
aVwhich was distant for the humpback.
p308
aVIt's loud, clear \u2014 you can hear it very clearly.
p309
aVHere's the same call recorded from a hydrophone
p310
aV500 miles away.
p311
aVThere's a lot of noise, which is mostly other whales.
p312
aVBut you can still hear that faint call.
p313
aa(lp314
VLet's now switch and think about
p315
aVa potential for human impacts.
p316
aVThe most dominant sound that humans put into the ocean
p317
aVcomes from shipping.
p318
aVThis is the sound of a ship,
p319
aVand I'm having to talk a little louder to talk over it.
p320
aVImagine that whale listening from 500 miles.
p321
aVThere's a potential problem that maybe
p322
aVthis kind of shipping noise would prevent whales
p323
aVfrom being able to hear each other.
p324
aVNow this is something that's been known for quite a while.
p325
aa(lp326
VThis is a figure from a textbook on underwater sound.
p327
aVAnd on the y-axis
p328
aVis the loudness of average ambient noise in the deep ocean
p329
aVby frequency.
p330
aVIn the low frequencies, this line indicates
p331
aVsound that comes from seismic activity of the earth.
p332
aVUp high, these variable lines
p333
aVindicate increasing noise in this frequency range
p334
aVfrom higher wind and wave.
p335
aVBut right in the middle here where there's a sweet spot,
p336
aVthe noise is dominated by human ships.
p337
aVNow think about it. This is an amazing thing:
p338
aVThat in this frequency range where whales communicate,
p339
aVthe main source globally, on our planet, for the noise
p340
aVcomes from human ships,
p341
aVthousands of human ships, distant, far away,
p342
aVjust all aggregating.
p343
aa(lp344
VThe next slide will show what the impact this may have
p345
aVon the range at which whales can communicate.
p346
aVSo here we have the loudness of a call at the whale.
p347
aVAnd as we get farther away,
p348
aVthe sound gets fainter and fainter.
p349
aVNow in the pre-industrial ocean, as we were mentioning,
p350
aVthis whale call could be easily detected.
p351
aVIt's louder than noise
p352
aVat a range of a thousand kilometers.
p353
aVLet's now take that additional increase in noise
p354
aVthat we saw comes from shipping.
p355
aVAll of a sudden, the effective range of communication
p356
aVgoes from a thousand kilometers to 10 kilometers.
p357
aVNow if this signal is used for males and females
p358
aVto find each other for mating and they're dispersed,
p359
aVimagine the impact this could have
p360
aVon the recovery of endangered populations.
p361
aa(lp362
VWhales also have contact calls
p363
aVlike I described for the dolphins.
p364
aVI'll play the sound of a contact call used
p365
aVby right whales to stay in touch.
p366
aVAnd this is the kind of call that is used by,
p367
aVsay, right whale mothers and calves
p368
aVas they separate to come back again.
p369
aVNow imagine \u2014 let's put the ship noise in the picture.
p370
aVWhat's a mother to do
p371
aVif the ship comes by and her calf isn't there?
p372
aVI'll describe a couple strategies.
p373
aa(lp374
VOne strategy is if your call's down here,
p375
aVand the noise is in this band,
p376
aVyou could shift the frequency of your call out of the noise band
p377
aVand communicate better.
p378
aVSusan Parks of Penn State has actually studied this.
p379
aVShe's looked in the Atlantic. Here's data from the South Atlantic.
p380
aVHere's a typical South Atlantic contact call from the '70s.
p381
aVLook what happened by 2000 to the average call.
p382
aVSame thing in the North Atlantic,
p383
aVin the '50s versus 2000.
p384
aVOver the last 50 years,
p385
aVas we've put more noise into the oceans,
p386
aVthese whales have had to shift.
p387
aVIt's as if the whole population had to shift
p388
aVfrom being basses to singing as a tenor.
p389
aVIt's an amazing shift, induced by humans
p390
aVover this large scale,
p391
aVin both time and space.
p392
aa(lp393
VAnd we now know that whales can compensate for noise
p394
aVby calling louder, like I did when that ship was playing,
p395
aVby waiting for silence
p396
aVand by shifting their call out of the noise band.
p397
aVNow there's probably costs to calling louder
p398
aVor shifting the frequency away from where you want to be,
p399
aVand there's probably lost opportunities.
p400
aVIf we also have to wait for silence,
p401
aVthey may miss a critical opportunity to communicate.
p402
aVSo we have to be very concerned
p403
aVabout when the noise in habitats
p404
aVdegrades the habitat enough
p405
aVthat the animals either have to pay too much to be able to communicate,
p406
aVor are not able to perform critical functions.
p407
aVIt's a really important problem.
p408
aa(lp409
VAnd I'm happy to say that there are several
p410
aVvery promising developments in this area,
p411
aVlooking at the impact of shipping on whales.
p412
aVIn terms of the shipping noise,
p413
aVthe International Maritime Organization of the United Nations
p414
aVhas formed a group whose job is to establish
p415
aVguidelines for quieting ships,
p416
aVto tell the industry how you could quiet ships.
p417
aVAnd they've already found
p418
aVthat by being more intelligent about better propeller design,
p419
aVyou can reduce that noise by 90 percent.
p420
aVIf you actually insulate and isolate
p421
aVthe machinery of the ship from the hull,
p422
aVyou can reduce that noise by 99 percent.
p423
aVSo at this point, it's primarily an issue of cost and standards.
p424
aVIf this group can establish standards,
p425
aVand if the shipbuilding industry adopts them for building new ships,
p426
aVwe can now see a gradual decline
p427
aVin this potential problem.
p428
aa(lp429
VBut there's also another problem from ships that I'm illustrating here,
p430
aVand that's the problem of collision.
p431
aVThis is a whale that just squeaked by
p432
aVa rapidly moving container ship and avoided collision.
p433
aVBut collision is a serious problem.
p434
aVEndangered whales are killed every year by ship collision,
p435
aVand it's very important to try to reduce this.
p436
aVI'll discuss two very promising approaches.
p437
aVThe first case comes from the Bay of Fundy.
p438
aVThese black lines mark shipping lanes
p439
aVin and out of the Bay of Fundy.
p440
aVThe colorized area
p441
aVshows the risk of collision for endangered right whales
p442
aVbecause of the ships moving in this lane.
p443
aVIt turns out that this lane here
p444
aVgoes right through a major feeding area of right whales in the summer time,
p445
aVand it makes an area of a significant risk of collision.
p446
aVWell, biologists
p447
aVwho couldn't take no for an answer
p448
aVwent to the International Maritime Organization
p449
aVand petitioned them to say,
p450
aV"Can't you move that lane? Those are just lines on the ground.
p451
aVCan't you move them over to a place
p452
aVwhere there's less of a risk?"
p453
aVAnd the International Maritime Organization responded very strongly,
p454
aV"These are the new lanes."
p455
aVThe shipping lanes have been moved.
p456
aVAnd as you can see, the risk of collision is much lower.
p457
aa(lp458
VSo it's very promising, actually.
p459
aVWe can be very creative about thinking
p460
aVof different ways to reduce these risks.
p461
aVAnother action which was just taken independently
p462
aVby a shipping company itself
p463
aVwas initiated because of concerns the shipping company had
p464
aVabout greenhouse gas emissions with global warming.
p465
aVThe Maersk Line looked at their competition
p466
aVand saw that everybody who is in shipping thinks time is money.
p467
aVThey rush as fast as they can to get to their port.
p468
aVBut then they often wait there.
p469
aVWhat Maersk did is they worked ways to slow down.
p470
aVThey could slow down by about 50 percent.
p471
aVThis reduced their fuel consumption by about 30 percent,
p472
aVwhich saved them money,
p473
aVand at the same time, it had a significant benefit for whales.
p474
aVIt you slow down, you reduce the amount of noise you make
p475
aVand you reduce the risk of collision.
p476
aa(lp477
VSo to conclude, I'd just like to point out,
p478
aVyou know, the whales live in
p479
aVan amazing acoustic environment.
p480
aVThey've evolved over tens of millions of years
p481
aVto take advantage of this.
p482
aVAnd we need to be very attentive and vigilant
p483
aVto thinking about where things that we do
p484
aVmay unintentionally prevent them
p485
aVfrom being able to achieve their important activities.
p486
aVAt the same time, we need to be really creative
p487
aVin thinking of solutions to be able to help reduce these problems.
p488
aVI hope these examples have shown
p489
aVsome of the different directions we can take
p490
aVin addition to protected areas
p491
aVto be able to keep the ocean safe for whales to be able to continue to communicate.
p492
aa(lp493
VThank you very much.

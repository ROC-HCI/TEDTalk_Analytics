VThe first patient to ever be  treated with an antibiotic
p5
aVwas a policeman in Oxford.
p6
aVOn his day off from work,
p7
aVhe was scratched by a rose thorn while working in the garden.
p8
aVThat small scratch became infected.
p9
aVOver the next few days,  his head was swollen
p10
aVwith abscesses,
p11
aVand in fact his eye was so infected
p12
aVthat they had to take it out,
p13
aVand by February of 1941,
p14
aVthis poor man was on the verge of dying.
p15
aVHe was at Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford,
p16
aVand fortunately for him,
p17
aVa small team of doctors
p18
aVled by a Dr. Howard Florey
p19
aVhad managed to synthesize
p20
aVa very small amount of penicillin,
p21
aVa drug that had been discovered
p22
aV12 years before by Alexander Fleming
p23
aVbut had never actually been  used to treat a human,
p24
aVand indeed no one even  knew if the drug would work,
p25
aVif it was full of impurities  that would kill the patient,
p26
aVbut Florey and his team figured
p27
aVif they had to use it,  they might as well use it
p28
aVon someone who was going to die anyway.
p29
aa(lp30
VSo they gave Albert Alexander,
p31
aVthis Oxford policeman, the drug,
p32
aVand within 24 hours,
p33
aVhe started getting better.
p34
aVHis fever went down,  his appetite came back.
p35
aVSecond day, he was doing much better.
p36
aVThey were starting to  run out of penicillin,
p37
aVso what they would do  was run with his urine
p38
aVacross the road to re-synthesize  the penicillin from his urine
p39
aVand give it back to him,
p40
aVand that worked.
p41
aVDay four, well on the way to recovery.
p42
aVThis was a miracle.
p43
aVDay five, they ran out of penicillin,
p44
aVand the poor man died.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo that story didn't end that well,
p47
aVbut fortunately for  millions of other people,
p48
aVlike this child who was treated  again in the early 1940s,
p49
aVwho was again dying of a sepsis,
p50
aVand within just six days, you can see,
p51
aVrecovered thanks to this  wonder drug, penicillin.
p52
aVMillions have lived,
p53
aVand global health has been transformed.
p54
aVNow, antibiotics have been used
p55
aVfor patients like this,
p56
aVbut they've also been  used rather frivolously
p57
aVin some instances,
p58
aVfor treating someone  with just a cold or the flu,
p59
aVwhich they might not have  responded to an antibiotic,
p60
aVand they've also been  used in large quantities
p61
aVsub-therapeutically, which means in small concentrations,
p62
aVto make chicken and hogs grow faster.
p63
aVJust to save a few pennies on the price of meat,
p64
aVwe've spent a lot of  antibiotics on animals,
p65
aVnot for treatment, not for sick animals,
p66
aVbut primarily for growth promotion.
p67
aa(lp68
VNow, what did that lead us to?
p69
aVBasically, the massive use of antibiotics
p70
aVaround the world
p71
aVhas imposed such large selection pressure on bacteria
p72
aVthat resistance is now a problem,
p73
aVbecause we've now selected for just
p74
aVthe resistant bacteria.
p75
aa(lp76
VAnd I'm sure you've all read about this in the newspapers,
p77
aVyou've seen this in every magazine
p78
aVthat you come across,
p79
aVbut I really want you to appreciate
p80
aVthe significance of this problem.
p81
aVThis is serious.
p82
aVThe next slide I'm about to show you is  of carbapenem resistance in acinetobacter.
p83
aVAcinetobacter is a nasty hospital bug,
p84
aVand carbapenem is pretty much
p85
aVthe strongest class of antibiotics
p86
aVthat we can throw at this bug.
p87
aVAnd you can see in 1999
p88
aVthis is the pattern of resistance,
p89
aVmostly under about 10 percent across the United States.
p90
aVNow watch what happens  when we play the video.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo I don't know where you live,
p93
aVbut wherever it is, it certainly is a lot worse now
p94
aVthan it was in 1999,
p95
aVand that is the problem of antibiotic resistance.
p96
aVIt's a global issue
p97
aVaffecting both rich and poor countries,
p98
aVand at the heart of it,  you might say, well,
p99
aVisn't this really just a medical issue?
p100
aVIf we taught doctors how not  to use antibiotics as much,
p101
aVif we taught patients how  not to demand antibiotics,
p102
aVperhaps this really wouldn't be an issue,
p103
aVand maybe the pharmaceutical companies
p104
aVshould be working harder to develop
p105
aVmore antibiotics.
p106
aVNow, it turns out that there's something  fundamental about antibiotics
p107
aVwhich makes it different from other drugs,
p108
aVwhich is that if I misuse antibiotics
p109
aVor I use antibiotics,
p110
aVnot only am I affected but  others are affected as well,
p111
aVin the same way as if I  choose to drive to work
p112
aVor take a plane to go somewhere,
p113
aVthat the costs I impose on others
p114
aVthrough global climate change go everywhere,
p115
aVand I don't necessarily take these costs into consideration.
p116
aVThis is what economists might  call a problem of the commons,
p117
aVand the problem of the commons is exactly
p118
aVwhat we face in the case  of antibiotics as well:
p119
aVthat we don't consider \u2014
p120
aVand we, including individuals, patients,
p121
aVhospitals, entire health systems \u2014
p122
aVdo not consider the costs  that they impose on others
p123
aVby the way antibiotics are actually used.
p124
aa(lp125
VNow, that's a problem that's similar
p126
aVto another area that we all know about,
p127
aVwhich is of fuel use and energy,
p128
aVand of course energy use
p129
aVboth depletes energy as well as
p130
aVleads to local pollution  and climate change.
p131
aVAnd typically, in the case of energy,
p132
aVthere are two ways in which you can deal with the problem.
p133
aVOne is, we can make better use of the oil that we have,
p134
aVand that's analogous to making better use
p135
aVof existing antibiotics,
p136
aVand we can do this in a number of ways
p137
aVthat we'll talk about in a second,
p138
aVbut the other option is the  "drill, baby, drill" option,
p139
aVwhich in the case of antibiotics  is to go find new antibiotics.
p140
aa(lp141
VNow, these are not separate.
p142
aVThey're related, because if we invest heavily
p143
aVin new oil wells,
p144
aVwe reduce the incentives  for conservation of oil
p145
aVin the same way that's going  to happen for antibiotics.
p146
aVThe reverse is also going  to happen, which is that
p147
aVif we use our antibiotics appropriately,
p148
aVwe don't necessarily have  to make the investments
p149
aVin new drug development.
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd if you thought that these two were entirely,
p152
aVfully balanced between these two options,
p153
aVyou might consider the fact that
p154
aVthis is really a game that we're playing.
p155
aVThe game is really one of coevolution,
p156
aVand coevolution is, in  this particular picture,
p157
aVbetween cheetahs and gazelles.
p158
aVCheetahs have evolved to run faster,
p159
aVbecause if they didn't run faster,
p160
aVthey wouldn't get any lunch.
p161
aVGazelles have evolved to run faster because
p162
aVif they don't run faster, they would be lunch.
p163
aVNow, this is the game we're playing against the bacteria,
p164
aVexcept we're not the cheetahs,
p165
aVwe're the gazelles,
p166
aVand the bacteria would,
p167
aVjust in the course of this little talk,
p168
aVwould have had kids and grandkids
p169
aVand figured out how to be resistant
p170
aVjust by selection and trial and error,
p171
aVtrying it over and over again.
p172
aVWhereas how do we stay  ahead of the bacteria?
p173
aVWe have drug discovery processes,
p174
aVscreening molecules,
p175
aVwe have clinical trials,
p176
aVand then, when we think we have a drug,
p177
aVthen we have the FDA regulatory process.
p178
aVAnd once we go through all of that,
p179
aVthen we try to stay one step ahead
p180
aVof the bacteria.
p181
aa(lp182
VNow, this is clearly not a  game that can be sustained,
p183
aVor one that we can win
p184
aVby simply innovating to stay ahead.
p185
aVWe've got to slow the pace of coevolution down,
p186
aVand there are ideas that we  can borrow from energy
p187
aVthat are helpful in thinking about
p188
aVhow we might want to do this in the case
p189
aVof antibiotics as well.
p190
aVNow, if you think about how we deal with
p191
aVenergy pricing, for instance,
p192
aVwe consider emissions taxes,
p193
aVwhich means we're imposing  the costs of pollution
p194
aVon people who actually use that energy.
p195
aVWe might consider doing that for antibiotics as well,
p196
aVand perhaps that would make sure that antibiotics
p197
aVactually get used appropriately.
p198
aVThere are clean energy subsidies,
p199
aVwhich are to switch to fuels which don't pollute as much
p200
aVor perhaps don't need fossil fuels.
p201
aVNow, the analogy here is, perhaps we need
p202
aVto move away from using antibiotics,
p203
aVand if you think about it, what are  good substitutes for antibiotics?
p204
aVWell, turns out that anything that reduces
p205
aVthe need for the antibiotic would really work,
p206
aVso that could include improving hospital infection control
p207
aVor vaccinating people,
p208
aVparticularly against  the seasonal influenza.
p209
aVAnd the seasonal flu is probably
p210
aVthe biggest driver of antibiotic use,
p211
aVboth in this country as well as in many other countries,
p212
aVand that could really help.
p213
aVA third option might include something like tradeable permits.
p214
aVAnd these seem like faraway scenarios,
p215
aVbut if you consider the  fact that we might not
p216
aVhave antibiotics for many  people who have infections,
p217
aVwe might consider the fact that we might
p218
aVwant to allocate who actually gets to use
p219
aVsome of these antibiotics over others,
p220
aVand some of these might have to be on the basis of clinical need,
p221
aVbut also on the basis of pricing.
p222
aVAnd certainly consumer education works.
p223
aVVery often, people overuse antibiotics
p224
aVor prescribe too much without necessarily
p225
aVknowing that they do so,
p226
aVand feedback mechanisms
p227
aVhave been found to be useful,
p228
aVboth on energy \u2014
p229
aVWhen you tell someone that they're using
p230
aVa lot of energy during peak hour,
p231
aVthey tend to cut back,
p232
aVand the same sort of example has been performed
p233
aVeven in the case of antibiotics.
p234
aVA hospital in St. Louis basically would put up
p235
aVon a chart the names of surgeons
p236
aVin the ordering of how much antibiotics they'd used
p237
aVin the previous month,
p238
aVand this was purely an  informational feedback,
p239
aVthere was no shaming,
p240
aVbut essentially that provided  some information back
p241
aVto surgeons that maybe they could rethink
p242
aVhow they were using antibiotics.
p243
aa(lp244
VNow, there's a lot that can be done
p245
aVon the supply side as well.
p246
aVIf you look at the price of penicillin,
p247
aVthe cost per day is about 10 cents.
p248
aVIt's a fairly cheap drug.
p249
aVIf you take drugs that have been introduced since then \u2014
p250
aVlinezolid or daptomycin \u2014
p251
aVthose are significantly more expensive,
p252
aVso to a world that has been used to paying 10 cents a day for antibiotics,
p253
aVthe idea of paying 180 dollars per day
p254
aVseems like a lot.
p255
aVBut what is that really telling us?
p256
aVThat price is telling us
p257
aVthat we should no longer
p258
aVtake cheap, effective  antibiotics as a given
p259
aVinto the foreseeable future,
p260
aVand that price is a signal to us
p261
aVthat perhaps we need to be paying
p262
aVmuch more attention to conservation.
p263
aVThat price is also a signal
p264
aVthat maybe we need to start looking at other technologies,
p265
aVin the same way that  gasoline prices are a signal
p266
aVand an impetus, to, say,
p267
aVthe development of electric cars.
p268
aVPrices are important signals
p269
aVand we need to pay attention,
p270
aVbut we also need to consider the fact that
p271
aValthough these high prices seem unusual for antibiotics,
p272
aVthey're nothing compared to the price per day
p273
aVof some cancer drugs,
p274
aVwhich might save a patient's life only for a few months or perhaps a year,
p275
aVwhereas antibiotics would potentially
p276
aVsave a patient's life forever.
p277
aVSo this is going to involve
p278
aVa whole new paradigm shift,
p279
aVand it's also a scary shift because
p280
aVin many parts of this country,
p281
aVin many parts of the world,
p282
aVthe idea of paying 200 dollars
p283
aVfor a day of antibiotic treatment
p284
aVis simply unimaginable.
p285
aVSo we need to think about that.
p286
aa(lp287
VNow, there are backstop options,
p288
aVwhich is other alternative technologies
p289
aVthat people are working on.
p290
aVIt includes bacteriophages, probiotics,
p291
aVquorum sensing, synbiotics.
p292
aa(lp293
VNow, all of these are useful avenues to pursue,
p294
aVand they will become even more lucrative
p295
aVwhen the price of new  antibiotics starts going higher,
p296
aVand we've seen that the market does actually respond,
p297
aVand the government is now considering
p298
aVways of subsidizing new  antibiotics and development.
p299
aVBut there are challenges here.
p300
aVWe don't want to just throw money at a problem.
p301
aVWhat we want to be able to do
p302
aVis invest in new antibiotics
p303
aVin ways that actually encourage
p304
aVappropriate use and sales of those antibiotics,
p305
aVand that really is the challenge here.
p306
aa(lp307
VNow, going back to these technologies,
p308
aVyou all remember the line from that famous
p309
aVdinosaur film, "Nature will find a way."
p310
aVSo it's not as if these are  permanent solutions.
p311
aVWe really have to remember that, whatever the technology might be,
p312
aVthat nature will find some  way to work around it.
p313
aa(lp314
VYou might think, well,  this is just a problem
p315
aVjust with antibiotics and with bacteria,
p316
aVbut it turns out that we  have the exact same
p317
aVidentical problem in  many other fields as well,
p318
aVwith multidrug-resistant tuberculosis,
p319
aVwhich is a serious problem  in India and South Africa.
p320
aVThousands of patients are dying because
p321
aVthe second-line drugs are so expensive,
p322
aVand in some instances, even those don't work
p323
aVand you have XDR TB.
p324
aVViruses are becoming resistant.
p325
aVAgricultural pests. Malaria parasites.
p326
aVRight now, much of the world depends on
p327
aVone drug, artemisinin drugs,
p328
aVessentially to treat malaria.
p329
aVResistance to artemisinin has already emerged,
p330
aVand if this were to become widespread,
p331
aVthat puts at risk
p332
aVthe single drug that we have to  treat malaria around the world
p333
aVin a way that's currently  safe and efficacious.
p334
aVMosquitos develop resistance.
p335
aVIf you have kids, you probably  know about head lice,
p336
aVand if you're from New York City,
p337
aVI understand that the  specialty there is bedbugs.
p338
aVSo those are also resistant.
p339
aVAnd we have to bring an example from across the pond.
p340
aVTurns out that rats are  also resistant to poisons.
p341
aa(lp342
VNow, what's common  to all of these things is
p343
aVthe idea that we've had these technologies
p344
aVto control nature only for  the last 70, 80 or 100 years
p345
aVand essentially in a blink,
p346
aVwe have squandered our ability to control,
p347
aVbecause we have not recognized
p348
aVthat natural selection and  evolution was going to find
p349
aVa way to get back,
p350
aVand we need to completely rethink
p351
aVhow we're going to use
p352
aVmeasures to control biological organisms,
p353
aVand rethink how we incentivize
p354
aVthe development, introduction,
p355
aVin the case of antibiotics prescription,
p356
aVand use of these valuable resources.
p357
aVAnd we really now need to  start thinking about them
p358
aVas natural resources.
p359
aVAnd so we stand at a crossroads.
p360
aVAn option is to go through that rethinking
p361
aVand carefully consider incentives
p362
aVto change how we do business.
p363
aVThe alternative is
p364
aVa world in which even a blade of grass
p365
aVis a potentially lethal weapon.
p366
aa(lp367
VThank you.

VI got my first computer when I was a teenager growing up in Accra,
p5
aVand it was a really cool device.
p6
aVYou could play games with it. You could program it in BASIC.
p7
aVAnd I was fascinated.
p8
aVSo I went into the library to figure out how did this thing work.
p9
aVI read about how the CPU is constantly shuffling data back and forth
p10
aVbetween the memory, the RAM and the ALU,
p11
aVthe arithmetic and logic unit.
p12
aVAnd I thought to myself, this CPU really has to work like crazy
p13
aVjust to keep all this data moving through the system.
p14
aa(lp15
VBut nobody was really worried about this.
p16
aVWhen computers were first introduced,
p17
aVthey were said to be a million times faster than neurons.
p18
aVPeople were really excited. They thought they would soon outstrip
p19
aVthe capacity of the brain.
p20
aVThis is a quote, actually, from Alan Turing:
p21
aV"In 30 years, it will be as easy to ask a computer a question
p22
aVas to ask a person."
p23
aVThis was in 1946. And now, in 2007, it's still not true.
p24
aVAnd so, the question is, why aren't we really seeing
p25
aVthis kind of power in computers that we see in the brain?
p26
aa(lp27
VWhat people didn't realize, and I'm just beginning to realize right now,
p28
aVis that we pay a huge price for the speed
p29
aVthat we claim is a big advantage of these computers.
p30
aVLet's take a look at some numbers.
p31
aVThis is Blue Gene, the fastest computer in the world.
p32
aVIt's got 120,000 processors; they can basically process
p33
aV10 quadrillion bits of information per second.
p34
aVThat's 10 to the sixteenth. And they consume one and a half megawatts of power.
p35
aVSo that would be really great, if you could add that
p36
aVto the production capacity in Tanzania.
p37
aVIt would really boost the economy.
p38
aVJust to go back to the States,
p39
aVif you translate the amount of power or electricity
p40
aVthis computer uses to the amount of households in the States,
p41
aVyou get 1,200 households in the U.S.
p42
aVThat's how much power this computer uses.
p43
aa(lp44
VNow, let's compare this with the brain.
p45
aVThis is a picture of, actually Rory Sayres' girlfriend's brain.
p46
aVRory is a graduate student at Stanford.
p47
aVHe studies the brain using MRI, and he claims that
p48
aVthis is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned.
p49
aV(Laughter)
p50
aVSo that's true love, right there.
p51
aVNow, how much computation does the brain do?
p52
aVI estimate 10 to the 16 bits per second,
p53
aVwhich is actually about very similar to what Blue Gene does.
p54
aVSo that's the question. The question is, how much \u2014
p55
aVthey are doing a similar amount of processing, similar amount of data \u2014
p56
aVthe question is how much energy or electricity does the brain use?
p57
aVAnd it's actually as much as your laptop computer:
p58
aVit's just 10 watts.
p59
aVSo what we are doing right now with computers
p60
aVwith the energy consumed by 1,200 houses,
p61
aVthe brain is doing with the energy consumed by your laptop.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo the question is, how is the brain able to achieve this kind of efficiency?
p64
aVAnd let me just summarize. So the bottom line:
p65
aVthe brain processes information using 100,000 times less energy
p66
aVthan we do right now with this computer technology that we have.
p67
aVHow is the brain able to do this?
p68
aVLet's just take a look about how the brain works,
p69
aVand then I'll compare that with how computers work.
p70
aVSo, this clip is from the PBS series, "The Secret Life of the Brain."
p71
aVIt shows you these cells that process information.
p72
aVThey are called neurons.
p73
aVThey send little pulses of electricity down their processes to each other,
p74
aVand where they contact each other, those little pulses
p75
aVof electricity can jump from one neuron to the other.
p76
aVThat process is called a synapse.
p77
aVYou've got this huge network of cells interacting with each other \u2014
p78
aVabout 100 million of them,
p79
aVsending about 10 quadrillion of these pulses around every second.
p80
aVAnd that's basically what's going on in your brain right now as you're watching this.
p81
aa(lp82
VHow does that compare with the way computers work?
p83
aVIn the computer, you have all the data
p84
aVgoing through the central processing unit,
p85
aVand any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck,
p86
aVwhereas in the brain, what you have is these neurons,
p87
aVand the data just really flows through a network of connections
p88
aVamong the neurons. There's no bottleneck here.
p89
aVIt's really a network in the literal sense of the word.
p90
aVThe net is doing the work in the brain.
p91
aVIf you just look at these two pictures,
p92
aVthese kind of words pop into your mind.
p93
aVThis is serial and it's rigid \u2014 it's like cars on a freeway,
p94
aVeverything has to happen in lockstep \u2014
p95
aVwhereas this is parallel and it's fluid.
p96
aVInformation processing is very dynamic and adaptive.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo I'm not the first to figure this out. This is a quote from Brian Eno:
p99
aV"the problem with computers is that there is not enough Africa in them."
p100
aV(Laughter)
p101
aVBrian actually said this in 1995.
p102
aVAnd nobody was listening then,
p103
aVbut now people are beginning to listen
p104
aVbecause there's a pressing, technological problem that we face.
p105
aVAnd I'll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides.
p106
aa(lp107
VThis is \u2014 it's actually really this remarkable convergence
p108
aVbetween the devices that we use to compute in computers,
p109
aVand the devices that our brains use to compute.
p110
aVThe devices that computers use are what's called a transistor.
p111
aVThis electrode here, called the gate, controls the flow of current
p112
aVfrom the source to the drain \u2014 these two electrodes.
p113
aVAnd that current, electrical current,
p114
aVis carried by electrons, just like in your house and so on.
p115
aVAnd what you have here is, when you actually turn on the gate,
p116
aVyou get an increase in the amount of current, and you get a steady flow of current.
p117
aVAnd when you turn off the gate, there's no current flowing through the device.
p118
aVYour computer uses this presence of current to represent a one,
p119
aVand the absence of current to represent a zero.
p120
aa(lp121
VNow, what's happening is that as transistors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller,
p122
aVthey no longer behave like this.
p123
aVIn fact, they are starting to behave like the device that neurons use to compute,
p124
aVwhich is called an ion channel.
p125
aVAnd this is a little protein molecule.
p126
aVI mean, neurons have thousands of these.
p127
aVAnd it sits in the membrane of the cell and it's got a pore in it.
p128
aVAnd these are individual potassium ions
p129
aVthat are flowing through that pore.
p130
aVNow, this pore can open and close.
p131
aVBut, when it's open, because these ions have to line up
p132
aVand flow through, one at a time, you get a kind of sporadic, not steady \u2014
p133
aVit's a sporadic flow of current.
p134
aVAnd even when you close the pore \u2014 which neurons can do,
p135
aVthey can open and close these pores to generate electrical activity \u2014
p136
aVeven when it's closed, because these ions are so small,
p137
aVthey can actually sneak through, a few can sneak through at a time.
p138
aVSo, what you have is that when the pore is open,
p139
aVyou get some current sometimes.
p140
aVThese are your ones, but you've got a few zeros thrown in.
p141
aVAnd when it's closed, you have a zero,
p142
aVbut you have a few ones thrown in.
p143
aa(lp144
VNow, this is starting to happen in transistors.
p145
aVAnd the reason why that's happening is that, right now, in 2007 \u2014
p146
aVthe technology that we are using \u2014 a transistor is big enough
p147
aVthat several electrons can flow through the channel simultaneously, side by side.
p148
aVIn fact, there's about 12 electrons can all be flowing this way.
p149
aVAnd that means that a transistor corresponds
p150
aVto about 12 ion channels in parallel.
p151
aVNow, in a few years time, by 2015, we will shrink transistors so much.
p152
aVThis is what Intel does to keep adding more cores onto the chip.
p153
aVOr your memory sticks that you have now can carry one gigabyte
p154
aVof stuff on them \u2014 before, it was 256.
p155
aVTransistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen,
p156
aVand technology has really benefitted from that.
p157
aa(lp158
VBut what's happening now is that in 2015, the transistor is going to become so small,
p159
aVthat it corresponds to only one electron at a time
p160
aVcan flow through that channel,
p161
aVand that corresponds to a single ion channel.
p162
aVAnd you start having the same kind of traffic jams that you have in the ion channel.
p163
aVThe current will turn on and off at random,
p164
aVeven when it's supposed to be on.
p165
aVAnd that means your computer is going to get
p166
aVits ones and zeros mixed up, and that's going to crash your machine.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo, we are at the stage where we
p169
aVdon't really know how to compute with these kinds of devices.
p170
aVAnd the only kind of thing \u2014 the only thing we know right now
p171
aVthat can compute with these kinds of devices are the brain.
p172
aa(lp173
VOK, so a computer picks a specific item of data from memory,
p174
aVit sends it into the processor or the ALU,
p175
aVand then it puts the result back into memory.
p176
aVThat's the red path that's highlighted.
p177
aVThe way brains work, I told you all, you have got all these neurons.
p178
aVAnd the way they represent information is
p179
aVthey break up that data into little pieces
p180
aVthat are represented by pulses and different neurons.
p181
aVSo you have all these pieces of data
p182
aVdistributed throughout the network.
p183
aVAnd then the way that you process that data to get a result
p184
aVis that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity,
p185
aVjust by it flowing through the network.
p186
aVSo you set up these connections
p187
aVsuch that the input pattern just flows
p188
aVand generates the output pattern.
p189
aa(lp190
VWhat you see here is that there's these redundant connections.
p191
aVSo if this piece of data or this piece of the data gets clobbered,
p192
aVit doesn't show up over here, these two pieces can activate the missing part
p193
aVwith these redundant connections.
p194
aVSo even when you go to these crappy devices
p195
aVwhere sometimes you want a one and you get a zero, and it doesn't show up,
p196
aVthere's redundancy in the network
p197
aVthat can actually recover the missing information.
p198
aVIt makes the brain inherently robust.
p199
aVWhat you have here is a system where you store data locally.
p200
aVAnd it's brittle, because each of these steps has to be flawless,
p201
aVotherwise you lose that data, whereas in the brain, you have a system
p202
aVthat stores data in a distributed way, and it's robust.
p203
aa(lp204
VWhat I want to basically talk about is my dream,
p205
aVwhich is to build a computer that works like the brain.
p206
aVThis is something that we've been working on for the last couple of years.
p207
aVAnd I'm going to show you a system that we designed
p208
aVto model the retina,
p209
aVwhich is a piece of brain that lines the inside of your eyeball.
p210
aVWe didn't do this by actually writing code, like you do in a computer.
p211
aVIn fact, the processing that happens
p212
aVin that little piece of brain is very similar
p213
aVto the kind of processing that computers
p214
aVdo when they stream video over the Internet.
p215
aVThey want to compress the information \u2014
p216
aVthey just want to send the changes, what's new in the image, and so on \u2014
p217
aVand that is how your eyeball
p218
aVis able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve,
p219
aVto send to the rest of the brain.
p220
aa(lp221
VInstead of doing this in software, or doing those kinds of algorithms,
p222
aVwe went and talked to neurobiologists
p223
aVwho have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that's called the retina.
p224
aVAnd they figured out all the different cells,
p225
aVand they figured out the network, and we just took that network
p226
aVand we used it as the blueprint for the design of a silicon chip.
p227
aVSo now the neurons are represented by little nodes or circuits on the chip,
p228
aVand the connections among the neurons are represented, actually modeled by transistors.
p229
aVAnd these transistors are behaving essentially
p230
aVjust like ion channels behave in the brain.
p231
aVIt will give you the same kind of robust architecture that I described.
p232
aa(lp233
VHere is actually what our artificial eye looks like.
p234
aVThe retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here.
p235
aVAnd the chip \u2014 I'm going to show you a video
p236
aVthat the silicon retina put out of its output
p237
aVwhen it was looking at Kareem Zaghloul,
p238
aVwho's the student who designed this chip.
p239
aVLet me explain what you're going to see, OK,
p240
aVbecause it's putting out different kinds of information,
p241
aVit's not as straightforward as a camera.
p242
aVThe retina chip extracts four different kinds of information.
p243
aVIt extracts regions with dark contrast,
p244
aVwhich will show up on the video as red.
p245
aVAnd it extracts regions with white or light contrast,
p246
aVwhich will show up on the video as green.
p247
aa(lp248
VThis is Kareem's dark eyes
p249
aVand that's the white background that you see here.
p250
aVAnd then it also extracts movement.
p251
aVWhen Kareem moves his head to the right,
p252
aVyou will see this blue activity there;
p253
aVit represents regions where the contrast is increasing in the image,
p254
aVthat's where it's going from dark to light.
p255
aVAnd you also see this yellow activity,
p256
aVwhich represents regions where contrast is decreasing;
p257
aVit's going from light to dark.
p258
aVAnd these four types of information \u2014
p259
aVyour optic nerve has about a million fibers in it,
p260
aVand 900,000 of those fibers
p261
aVsend these four types of information.
p262
aVSo we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve.
p263
aa(lp264
VWhat you notice here is that these snapshots
p265
aVtaken from the output of the retina chip are very sparse, right?
p266
aVIt doesn't light up green everywhere in the background,
p267
aVonly on the edges, and then in the hair, and so on.
p268
aVAnd this is the same thing you see
p269
aVwhen people compress video to send: they want to make it very sparse,
p270
aVbecause that file is smaller. And this is what the retina is doing,
p271
aVand it's doing it just with the circuitry, and how this network of neurons
p272
aVthat are interacting in there, which we've captured on the chip.
p273
aa(lp274
VBut the point that I want to make \u2014 I'll show you up here.
p275
aVSo this image here is going to look like these ones,
p276
aVbut here I'll show you that we can reconstruct the image,
p277
aVso, you know, you can almost recognize Kareem in that top part there.
p278
aVAnd so, here you go.
p279
aVYes, so that's the idea.
p280
aVWhen you stand still, you just see the light and dark contrasts.
p281
aVBut when it's moving back and forth,
p282
aVthe retina picks up these changes.
p283
aVAnd that's why, you know, when you're sitting here
p284
aVand something happens in your background,
p285
aVyou merely move your eyes to it.
p286
aVThere are these cells that detect change
p287
aVand you move your attention to it.
p288
aVSo those are very important for catching somebody
p289
aVwho's trying to sneak up on you.
p290
aa(lp291
VLet me just end by saying that this is what happens
p292
aVwhen you put Africa in a piano, OK.
p293
aVThis is a steel drum here that has been modified,
p294
aVand that's what happens when you put Africa in a piano.
p295
aVAnd what I would like us to do is put Africa in the computer,
p296
aVand come up with a new kind of computer
p297
aVthat will generate thought, imagination, be creative and things like that.
p298
aVThank you.
p299
aV(Applause)
p300
aa(lp301
VChris Anderson: Question for you, Kwabena.
p302
aVDo you put together in your mind the work you're doing,
p303
aVthe future of Africa, this conference \u2014
p304
aVwhat connections can we make, if any, between them?
p305
aa(lp306
VKwabena Boahen: Yes, like I said at the beginning,
p307
aVI got my first computer when I was a teenager, growing up in Accra.
p308
aVAnd I had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it.
p309
aVIt was very brute force; it was very inelegant.
p310
aVI don't think that I would've had that reaction,
p311
aVif I'd grown up reading all this science fiction,
p312
aVhearing about RD2D2, whatever it was called, and just \u2014 you know,
p313
aVbuying into this hype about computers.
p314
aVI was coming at it from a different perspective,
p315
aVwhere I was bringing that different perspective
p316
aVto bear on the problem.
p317
aVAnd I think a lot of people in Africa have this different perspective,
p318
aVand I think that's going to impact technology.
p319
aVAnd that's going to impact how it's going to evolve.
p320
aVAnd I think you're going to be able to see, use that infusion,
p321
aVto come up with new things,
p322
aVbecause you're coming from a different perspective.
p323
aVI think we can contribute. We can dream like everybody else.
p324
aa(lp325
VCA: Thanks Kwabena, that was really interesting.
p326
aVThank you.

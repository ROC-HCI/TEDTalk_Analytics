VWe most certainly do talk to terrorists, no question about it.
p5
aVWe are at war with a new form of terrorism.
p6
aVIt's sort of the good old, traditional form of terrorism,
p7
aVbut it's sort of been packaged for the 21st century.
p8
aVOne of the big things about countering terrorism
p9
aVis, how do you perceive it?
p10
aVBecause perception leads to your response to it.
p11
aVSo if you have a traditional perception of terrorism,
p12
aVit would be that it's one of criminality, one of war.
p13
aVSo how are you going to respond to it?
p14
aVNaturally, it would follow that you meet kind with kind.
p15
aVYou fight it. If you have a more modernist approach,
p16
aVand your perception of terrorism is almost cause-and-effect,
p17
aVthen naturally from that, the responses that come out of it
p18
aVare much more asymmetrical.
p19
aa(lp20
VWe live in a modern, global world.
p21
aVTerrorists have actually adapted to it.
p22
aVIt's something we have to, too, and that means the people
p23
aVwho are working on counterterrorism responses
p24
aVhave to start, in effect, putting on
p25
aVtheir Google-tinted glasses, or whatever.
p26
aa(lp27
VFor my part, what I wanted us to do was just to look at
p28
aVterrorism as though it was a global brand,
p29
aVsay, Coca-Cola.
p30
aVBoth are fairly bad for your health. (Laughter)
p31
aVIf you look at it as a brand in those ways,
p32
aVwhat you'll come to realize is, it's a pretty flawed product.
p33
aVAs we've said, it's pretty bad for your health,
p34
aVit's bad for those who it affects,
p35
aVand it's not actually good if you're a suicide bomber either.
p36
aVIt doesn't actually do what it says on the tin.
p37
aVYou're not really going to get 72 virgins in heaven.
p38
aVIt's not going to happen, I don't think.
p39
aVAnd you're not really going to, in the '80s, end capitalism
p40
aVby supporting one of these groups. It's a load of nonsense.
p41
aa(lp42
VBut what you realize, it's got an Achilles' heel.
p43
aVThe brand has an Achilles' heel.
p44
aVWe've mentioned the health,
p45
aVbut it needs consumers to buy into it.
p46
aVThe consumers it needs are the terrorist constituency.
p47
aVThey're the people who buy into the brand, support them,
p48
aVfacilitate them, and they're the people
p49
aVwe've got to reach out to.
p50
aVWe've got to attack that brand in front of them.
p51
aa(lp52
VThere's two essential ways of doing that, if we carry on this brand theme.
p53
aVOne is reducing their market. What I mean is,
p54
aVit's their brand against our brand. We've got to compete.
p55
aVWe've got to show we're a better product.
p56
aVIf I'm trying to show we're a better product,
p57
aVI probably wouldn't do things like Guantanamo Bay.
p58
aVWe've talked there about curtailing the underlying need
p59
aVfor the product itself. You could be looking there at
p60
aVpoverty, injustice, all those sorts of things
p61
aVwhich feed terrorism.
p62
aa(lp63
VThe other thing to do is to knock the product,
p64
aVattack the brand myth, as we've said.
p65
aVYou know, there's nothing heroic about killing a young kid.
p66
aVPerhaps we need to focus on that and get that message back across.
p67
aVWe've got to reveal the dangers in the product.
p68
aVOur target audience, it's not just the producers of terrorism,
p69
aVas I've said, the terrorists.
p70
aVIt's not just the marketeers of terrorism,
p71
aVwhich is those who finance, those who facilitate it,
p72
aVbut it's the consumers of terrorism.
p73
aVWe've got to get in to those homelands.
p74
aVThat's where they recruit from. That's where they get their power and strength.
p75
aVThat's where their consumers come from.
p76
aVAnd we have to get our messaging in there.
p77
aVSo the essentials are, we've got to have interaction
p78
aVin those areas, with the terrorists, the facilitators, etc.
p79
aVWe've got to engage, we've got to educate,
p80
aVand we've got to have dialogue.
p81
aa(lp82
VNow, staying on this brand thing for just a few more seconds,
p83
aVthink about delivery mechanisms.
p84
aVHow are we going to do these attacks?
p85
aVWell, reducing the market is really one for governments
p86
aVand civil society. We've got to show we're better.
p87
aVWe've got to show our values.
p88
aVWe've got to practice what we preach.
p89
aVBut when it comes to knocking the brand,
p90
aVif the terrorists are Coca-Cola and we're Pepsi,
p91
aVI don't think, being Pepsi, anything we say about Coca-Cola,
p92
aVanyone's going to believe us.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo we've got to find a different mechanism,
p95
aVand one of the best mechanisms I've ever come across
p96
aVis the victims of terrorism.
p97
aVThey are somebody who can actually stand there and say,
p98
aV"This product's crap. I had it and I was sick for days.
p99
aVIt burnt my hand, whatever." You believe them.
p100
aVYou can see their scars. You trust them.
p101
aVBut whether it's victims, whether it's governments,
p102
aVNGOs, or even the Queen yesterday, in Northern Ireland,
p103
aVwe have to interact and engage with those different
p104
aVlayers of terrorism, and, in effect,
p105
aVwe do have to have a little dance with the devil.
p106
aa(lp107
VThis is my favorite part of my speech.
p108
aVI wanted to blow you all up to try and make a point,
p109
aVbut \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p110
aVTED, for health and safety reasons, have told me
p111
aVI've got to do a countdown, so
p112
aVI feel like a bit of an Irish or Jewish terrorist,
p113
aVsort of a health and safety terrorist, and I \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p114
aVI've got to count 3, 2, 1, and
p115
aVit's a bit alarming, so thinking of what my motto would be,
p116
aVand it would be, "Body parts, not heart attacks."
p117
aVSo 3, 2, 1. (Explosion sound)
p118
aVVery good. (Laughter)
p119
aVNow, lady in 15J was a suicide bomber amongst us all.
p120
aVWe're all victims of terrorism.
p121
aVThere's 625 of us in this room. We're going to be scarred for life.
p122
aVThere was a father and a son who sat in that seat over there.
p123
aVThe son's dead. The father lives.
p124
aVThe father will probably kick himself for years to come
p125
aVthat he didn't take that seat instead of his kid.
p126
aVHe's going to take to alcohol, and he's probably
p127
aVgoing to kill himself in three years. That's the stats.
p128
aVThere's a very young, attractive lady over here,
p129
aVand she has something which I think's the worst form
p130
aVof psychological, physical injury I've ever seen
p131
aVout of a suicide bombing: It's human shrapnel.
p132
aVWhat it means is, when she sat in a restaurant
p133
aVin years to come, 10 years to come, 15 years to come,
p134
aVor she's on the beach, every so often she's going to start
p135
aVrubbing her skin, and out of there will come
p136
aVa piece of that shrapnel.
p137
aVAnd that is a hard thing for the head to take.
p138
aVThere's a lady over there as well who lost her legs
p139
aVin this bombing.
p140
aVShe's going to find out that she gets a pitiful amount
p141
aVof money off our government
p142
aVfor looking after what's happened to her.
p143
aVShe had a daughter who was going to go to one of the best
p144
aVuniversities. She's going to give up university
p145
aVto look after Mum.
p146
aVWe're all here, and all of those who watch it
p147
aVare going to be traumatized by this event,
p148
aVbut all of you here who are victims are going to learn
p149
aVsome hard truths.
p150
aVThat is, our society, we sympathize, but after a while,
p151
aVwe start to ignore. We don't do enough as a society.
p152
aVWe do not look after our victims, and we do not enable them,
p153
aVand what I'm going to try and show is that actually,
p154
aVvictims are the best weapon we have
p155
aVagainst more terrorism.
p156
aa(lp157
VHow would the government at the turn of the millennium
p158
aVapproach today? Well, we all know.
p159
aVWhat they'd have done then is an invasion.
p160
aVIf the suicide bomber was from Wales,
p161
aVgood luck to Wales, I'd say.
p162
aVKnee-jerk legislation, emergency provision legislation \u2014
p163
aVwhich hits at the very basis of our society, as we all know \u2014
p164
aVit's a mistake.
p165
aVWe're going to drive prejudice throughout Edinburgh,
p166
aVthroughout the U.K., for Welsh people.
p167
aa(lp168
VToday's approach, governments have learned from their mistakes.
p169
aVThey are looking at what I've started off on,
p170
aVon these more asymmetrical approaches to it,
p171
aVmore modernist views, cause and effect.
p172
aVBut mistakes of the past are inevitable.
p173
aVIt's human nature.
p174
aVThe fear and the pressure to do something on them
p175
aVis going to be immense. They are going to make mistakes.
p176
aVThey're not just going to be smart.
p177
aa(lp178
VThere was a famous Irish terrorist who once summed up
p179
aVthe point very beautifully. He said,
p180
aV"The thing is, about the British government, is, is that it's got
p181
aVto be lucky all the time, and we only have to be lucky once."
p182
aa(lp183
VSo what we need to do is we have to effect it.
p184
aVWe've got to start thinking about being more proactive.
p185
aVWe need to build an arsenal of noncombative weapons
p186
aVin this war on terrorism.
p187
aVBut of course, it's ideas \u2014 is not something that governments do very well.
p188
aa(lp189
VI want to go back just to before the bang, to this idea of
p190
aVbrand, and I was talking about Coke and Pepsi, etc.
p191
aVWe see it as terrorism versus democracy in that brand war.
p192
aVThey'll see it as freedom fighters and truth
p193
aVagainst injustice, imperialism, etc.
p194
aa(lp195
VWe do have to see this as a deadly battlefield.
p196
aVIt's not just [our] flesh and blood they want.
p197
aVThey actually want our cultural souls, and that's why
p198
aVthe brand analogy is a very interesting way of looking at this.
p199
aVIf we look at al Qaeda. Al Qaeda was essentially
p200
aVa product on a shelf in a souk somewhere
p201
aVwhich not many people had heard of.
p202
aV9/11 launched it. It was its big marketing day,
p203
aVand it was packaged for the 21st century. They knew what they were doing.
p204
aVThey were effectively [doing] something in this brand image
p205
aVof creating a brand which can be franchised around
p206
aVthe world, where there's poverty, ignorance and injustice.
p207
aa(lp208
VWe, as I've said, have got to hit that market,
p209
aVbut we've got to use our heads rather than our might.
p210
aVIf we perceive it in this way as a brand, or other ways of thinking at it like this,
p211
aVwe will not resolve or counter terrorism.
p212
aa(lp213
VWhat I'd like to do is just briefly go through a few examples
p214
aVfrom my work on areas where we try and approach these things differently.
p215
aVThe first one has been dubbed "lawfare,"
p216
aVfor want of a better word.
p217
aVWhen we originally looked at bringing civil actions against terrorists,
p218
aVeveryone thought we were a bit mad and mavericks
p219
aVand crackpots. Now it's got a title. Everyone's doing it.
p220
aVThere's a bomb, people start suing.
p221
aVBut one of the first early cases on this was the Omagh Bombing.
p222
aVA civil action was brought from 1998.
p223
aVIn Omagh, bomb went off, Real IRA,
p224
aVmiddle of a peace process.
p225
aVThat meant that the culprits couldn't really be prosecuted
p226
aVfor lots of reasons, mostly to do with the peace process
p227
aVand what was going on, the greater good.
p228
aVIt also meant, then, if you can imagine this,
p229
aVthat the people who bombed your children
p230
aVand your husbands were walking around the supermarket
p231
aVthat you lived in.
p232
aVSome of those victims said enough is enough.
p233
aVWe brought a private action, and thank God, 10 years later,
p234
aVwe actually won it. There is a slight appeal on
p235
aVat the moment so I have to be a bit careful,
p236
aVbut I'm fairly confident.
p237
aa(lp238
VWhy was it effective?
p239
aVIt was effective not just because justice was seen to be done
p240
aVwhere there was a huge void.
p241
aVIt was because the Real IRA and other terrorist groups,
p242
aVtheir whole strength is from the fact that they are
p243
aVan underdog. When we put the victims as the underdog
p244
aVand flipped it, they didn't know what to do.
p245
aVThey were embarrassed. Their recruitment went down.
p246
aVThe bombs actually stopped \u2014 fact \u2014 because of this action.
p247
aVWe became, or those victims became, more importantly,
p248
aVa ghost that haunted the terrorist organization.
p249
aa(lp250
VThere's other examples. We have a case called Almog
p251
aVwhich is to do with a bank that was,
p252
aVallegedly, from our point of view,
p253
aVgiving rewards to suicide bombers.
p254
aVJust by bringing the very action,
p255
aVthat bank has stopped doing it, and indeed,
p256
aVthe powers that be around the world, which for real politic
p257
aVreasons before, couldn't actually deal with this issue,
p258
aVbecause there was lots of competing interests,
p259
aVhave actually closed down those loopholes in the banking system.
p260
aVThere's another case called the McDonald case,
p261
aVwhere some victims of Semtex, of the Provisional IRA bombings,
p262
aVwhich were supplied by Gaddafi, sued,
p263
aVand that action has led to amazing things for new Libya.
p264
aVNew Libya has been compassionate towards those victims,
p265
aVand started taking it \u2014 so it started a whole new dialogue there.
p266
aVBut the problem is, we need more and more support
p267
aVfor these ideas and cases.
p268
aa(lp269
VCivil affairs and civil society initiatives.
p270
aVA good one is in Somalia. There's a war on piracy.
p271
aVIf anyone thinks you can have a war on piracy
p272
aVlike a war on terrorism and beat it, you're wrong.
p273
aVWhat we're trying to do there is turn pirates to fisherman.
p274
aVThey used to be fisherman, of course,
p275
aVbut we stole their fish and dumped a load of toxic waste
p276
aVin their water, so what we're trying to do is create
p277
aVsecurity and employment by bringing a coastguard
p278
aValong with the fisheries industry, and I can guarantee you,
p279
aVas that builds, al Shabaab and such likes will not have
p280
aVthe poverty and injustice any longer to prey on those people.
p281
aVThese initiatives cost less than a missile,
p282
aVand certainly less than any soldier's life,
p283
aVbut more importantly, it takes the war to their homelands,
p284
aVand not onto our shore,
p285
aVand we're looking at the causes.
p286
aa(lp287
VThe last one I wanted to talk about was dialogue.
p288
aVThe advantages of dialogue are obvious.
p289
aVIt self-educates both sides, enables a better understanding,
p290
aVreveals the strengths and weaknesses,
p291
aVand yes, like some of the speakers before,
p292
aVthe shared vulnerability does lead to trust, and
p293
aVit does then become, that process, part of normalization.
p294
aVBut it's not an easy road. After the bomb,
p295
aVthe victims are not into this.
p296
aVThere's practical problems.
p297
aVIt's politically risky for the protagonists
p298
aVand for the interlocutors. On one occasion
p299
aVI was doing it, every time I did a point that they didn't like,
p300
aVthey actually threw stones at me,
p301
aVand when I did a point they liked,
p302
aVthey starting shooting in the air, equally not great. (Laughter)
p303
aVWhatever the point, it gets to the heart of the problem,
p304
aVyou're doing it, you're talking to them.
p305
aa(lp306
VNow, I just want to end with saying, if we follow reason,
p307
aVwe realize that I think we'd all say that we want to
p308
aVhave a perception of terrorism which is not just a pure
p309
aVmilitary perception of it.
p310
aVWe need to foster more
p311
aVmodern and asymmetrical responses to it.
p312
aVThis isn't about being soft on terrorism.
p313
aVIt's about fighting them on contemporary battlefields.
p314
aVWe must foster innovation, as I've said.
p315
aVGovernments are receptive. It won't come from those dusty corridors.
p316
aVThe private sector has a role.
p317
aVThe role we could do right now is going away
p318
aVand looking at how we can support victims around the world
p319
aVto bring initiatives.
p320
aa(lp321
VIf I was to leave you with some big questions here which
p322
aVmay change one's perception to it, and who knows what
p323
aVthoughts and responses will come out of it,
p324
aVbut did myself and my terrorist group actually need
p325
aVto blow you up to make our point?
p326
aVWe have to ask ourselves these questions, however unpalatable.
p327
aVHave we been ignoring an injustice or a humanitarian
p328
aVstruggle somewhere in the world?
p329
aVWhat if, actually, engagement on poverty and injustice
p330
aVis exactly what the terrorists wanted us to do?
p331
aVWhat if the bombs are just simply wake-up calls for us?
p332
aVWhat happens if that bomb went off
p333
aVbecause we didn't have any thoughts and things in place
p334
aVto allow dialogue to deal with these things and interaction?
p335
aa(lp336
VWhat is definitely uncontroversial
p337
aVis that, as I've said, we've got to stop being reactive,
p338
aVand more proactive, and I just want to leave you
p339
aVwith one idea, which is that
p340
aVit's a provocative question for you to think about,
p341
aVand the answer will require sympathy with the devil.
p342
aVIt's a question that's been tackled by many great thinkers
p343
aVand writers: What if society actually needs crisis to change?
p344
aVWhat if society actually needs terrorism
p345
aVto change and adapt for the better?
p346
aVIt's those Bulgakov themes, it's that picture of Jesus
p347
aVand the Devil hand in hand in Gethsemane
p348
aVwalking into the moonlight.
p349
aVWhat it would mean is that humans,
p350
aVin order to survive in development,
p351
aVquite Darwinian spirit here,
p352
aVinherently must dance with the devil.
p353
aa(lp354
VA lot of people say that communism was defeated
p355
aVby the Rolling Stones. It's a good theory.
p356
aVMaybe the Rolling Stones has a place in this.
p357
aVThank you.
p358
aV(Music) (Applause)
p359
aVBruno Giussani: Thank you. (Applause)

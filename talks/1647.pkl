VHi. My name is Cameron Russell,
p5
aVand for the last little while, I've been a model.
p6
aVActually, for 10 years.
p7
aVAnd I feel like
p8
aVthere's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now
p9
aVbecause I should not have worn this dress.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VSo luckily, I brought an outfit change.
p14
aVThis is the first outfit change on the TED stage,
p15
aVso you guys are pretty lucky to witness it, I think.
p16
aVIf some of the women were really horrified when I came out,
p17
aVyou don't have to tell me now, but I'll find out later on Twitter.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VI'd also note that I'm quite privileged
p22
aVto be able to transform what you think of me
p23
aVin a very brief 10 seconds.
p24
aVNot everybody gets to do that.
p25
aVThese heels are very uncomfortable, so good thing I wasn't going to wear them.
p26
aVThe worst part is putting this sweater over my head,
p27
aVbecause that's when you'll all laugh at me,
p28
aVso don't do anything while it's over my head.
p29
aVAll right.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo, why did I do that?
p32
aVThat was awkward.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VWell \u2014
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VHopefully not as awkward as that picture.
p41
aVImage is powerful,
p42
aVbut also, image is superficial.
p43
aVI just totally transformed what you thought of me, in six seconds.
p44
aVAnd in this picture,
p45
aVI had actually never had a boyfriend in real life.
p46
aVI was totally uncomfortable,
p47
aVand the photographer was telling me to arch my back
p48
aVand put my hand in that guy's hair.
p49
aVAnd of course, barring surgery,
p50
aVor the fake tan that I got two days ago for work,
p51
aVthere's very little that we can do to transform how we look,
p52
aVand how we look, though it is superficial and immutable,
p53
aVhas a huge impact on our lives.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo today, for me, being fearless means being honest.
p56
aVAnd I am on this stage because I am a model.
p57
aVI am on this stage because I am a pretty, white woman,
p58
aVand in my industry, we call that a sexy girl.
p59
aVI'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me,
p60
aVbut with an honest twist.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo the first question is, how do you become a model?
p63
aVI always just say, "Oh, I was scouted,"
p64
aVbut that means nothing.
p65
aVThe real way that I became a model
p66
aVis I won a genetic lottery, and I am the recipient of a legacy,
p67
aVand maybe you're wondering what is a legacy.
p68
aVWell, for the past few centuries
p69
aVwe have defined beauty not just as health and youth
p70
aVand symmetry that we're biologically programmed to admire,
p71
aVbut also as tall, slender figures,
p72
aVand femininity and white skin.
p73
aVAnd this is a legacy that was built for me,
p74
aVand it's a legacy that I've been cashing out on.
p75
aVAnd I know there are people in the audience
p76
aVwho are skeptical at this point,
p77
aVand maybe there are some fashionistas who are like,
p78
aV"Wait. Naomi. Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liu Wen."
p79
aVAnd first, I commend you on your model knowledge. Very impressive.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VBut unfortunately, I have to inform you that in 2007,
p84
aVa very inspired NYU Ph.D. student
p85
aVcounted all the models on the runway, every single one that was hired,
p86
aVand of the 677 models that were hired,
p87
aVonly 27, or less than four percent, were non-white.
p88
aa(lp89
VThe next question people always ask is,
p90
aV"Can I be a model when I grow up?"
p91
aVAnd the first answer is, "I don't know, they don't put me in charge of that."
p92
aVBut the second answer,
p93
aVand what I really want to say to these little girls is,
p94
aV"Why? You know? You can be anything.
p95
aVYou could be the President of the United States,
p96
aVor the inventor of the next Internet,
p97
aVor a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet,
p98
aVwhich would be awesome, because you'd be the first one."
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VIf, after this amazing list, they still are like,
p103
aV"No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model,"
p104
aVwell, then I say, "Be my boss."
p105
aVBecause I'm not in charge of anything,
p106
aVand you could be the editor in chief of American Vogue
p107
aVor the CEO of H&M, or the next Steven Meisel.
p108
aVSaying that you want to be a model when you grow up
p109
aVis akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up.
p110
aVIt's out of your control, and it's awesome,
p111
aVand it's not a career path.
p112
aa(lp113
VI will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accumulated model knowledge,
p114
aVbecause unlike cardiothoracic surgeons,
p115
aVit can just be distilled right now.
p116
aVSo, if the photographer is right there,
p117
aVthe light is right there, like a nice HMI,
p118
aVand the client says, "We want a walking shot,"
p119
aVthis leg goes first, nice and long, this arm goes back, this arm goes forward,
p120
aVthe head is at three quarters, and you just go back and forth,
p121
aVjust do that, and then you look back at your imaginary friends,
p122
aV300, 400, 500 times.
p123
aa(lp124
V(Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
VIt will look something like this.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VHopefully less awkward than that one in the middle.
p131
aVThat was \u2014 I don't know what happened there.
p132
aa(lp133
VUnfortunately, after you've gone to school,
p134
aVand you have a résumé and you've done a few jobs,
p135
aVyou can't say anything anymore,
p136
aVso if you say you want to be the President of the United States,
p137
aVbut your résumé reads, "Underwear Model: 10 years,"
p138
aVpeople give you a funny look.
p139
aa(lp140
VThe next question is, "Do they retouch all the photos?"
p141
aVAnd yeah, they pretty much retouch all the photos,
p142
aVbut that is only a small component of what's happening.
p143
aVThis picture is the very first picture that I ever took,
p144
aVand it's also the very first time that I had worn a bikini,
p145
aVand I didn't even have my period yet.
p146
aVI know we're getting personal, but I was a young girl.
p147
aVThis is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier.
p148
aVHere's me on the same day as this shoot.
p149
aVMy friend got to come.
p150
aVHere's me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue.
p151
aVHere's me on the soccer team and in V Magazine.
p152
aVAnd here's me today.
p153
aVAnd I hope what you're seeing
p154
aVis that these pictures are not pictures of me.
p155
aVThey are constructions,
p156
aVand they are constructions by a group of professionals,
p157
aVby hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists
p158
aVand all of their assistants and pre-production and post-production,
p159
aVand they build this.
p160
aVThat's not me.
p161
aa(lp162
VOkay, so the next question people always ask me is,
p163
aV"Do you get free stuff?"
p164
aa(lp165
V(Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
VI do have too many 8-inch heels which I never get to wear,
p168
aVexcept for earlier,
p169
aVbut the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life,
p170
aVand that's what we don't like to talk about.
p171
aa(lp172
VI grew up in Cambridge,
p173
aVand one time I went into a store and I forgot my money
p174
aVand they gave me the dress for free.
p175
aVWhen I was a teenager, I was driving with my friend
p176
aVwho was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course,
p177
aVwe got pulled over,
p178
aVand all it took was a "Sorry, officer," and we were on our way.
p179
aVAnd I got these free things because of how I look,
p180
aVnot who I am, and there are people paying a cost
p181
aVfor how they look and not who they are.
p182
aa(lp183
VI live in New York, and last year,
p184
aVof the 140,000 teenagers that were stopped and frisked,
p185
aV86% of them were black and Latino, and most of them were young men.
p186
aVAnd there are only 177,000 young black and Latino men in New York,
p187
aVso for them, it's not a question of, "Will I get stopped?"
p188
aVbut "How many times will I get stopped? When will I get stopped?"
p189
aVWhen I was researching this talk,
p190
aVI found out that of the 13-year-old girls in the United States,
p191
aV53% don't like their bodies,
p192
aVand that number goes to 78% by the time that they're 17.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo, the last question people ask me is,
p195
aV"What is it like to be a model?"
p196
aVAnd I think the answer that they're looking for is,
p197
aV"If you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair,
p198
aVyou will be so happy and fabulous."
p199
aVAnd when we're backstage,
p200
aVwe give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that.
p201
aVWe say, "It's really amazing to travel, and it's amazing to get to work
p202
aVwith creative, inspired, passionate people."
p203
aVAnd those things are true, but they're only one half of the story,
p204
aVbecause the thing that we never say on camera,
p205
aVthat I have never said on camera, is,
p206
aV"I am insecure."
p207
aVAnd I'm insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day.
p208
aVAnd if you ever are wondering,
p209
aV"If I have thinner thighs and shinier hair, will I be happier?"
p210
aVyou just need to meet a group of models,
p211
aVbecause they have the thinnest thighs, the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes,
p212
aVand they're the most physically insecure women probably on the planet.
p213
aa(lp214
VWhen I was writing this talk,
p215
aVI found it very difficult to strike an honest balance,
p216
aVbecause on the one hand,
p217
aVI felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say,
p218
aV"Look I've received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor,"
p219
aVand it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with,
p220
aV"and it doesn't always make me happy."
p221
aVBut mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression
p222
aVwhen I am one of the biggest beneficiaries.
p223
aa(lp224
VBut I'm also happy and honored to be up here
p225
aVand I think that it's great that I got to come
p226
aVbefore 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I'd had more agency in my career,
p227
aVbecause maybe then I wouldn't tell the story of how I got my first job,
p228
aVor maybe I wouldn't tell the story of how I paid for college,
p229
aVwhich seems so important right now.
p230
aa(lp231
VIf there's a takeaway to this talk,
p232
aVI hope it's that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging
p233
aVthe power of image in our perceived successes
p234
aVand our perceived failures.
p235
aa(lp236
VThank you.
p237
aa(lp238
V(Applause)

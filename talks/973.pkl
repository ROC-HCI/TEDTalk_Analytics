VI've been fascinated for a lifetime
p5
aVby the beauty, form and function
p6
aVof giant bluefin tuna.
p7
aVBluefin are warmblooded like us.
p8
aVThey're the largest of the tunas,
p9
aVthe second-largest fish in the sea \u2014 bony fish.
p10
aVThey actually are a fish
p11
aVthat is endothermic \u2014
p12
aVpowers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal.
p13
aVThat's one of our bluefin at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
p14
aVYou can see in its shape and its streamlined design
p15
aVit's powered for ocean swimming.
p16
aVIt flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins, gets lift,
p17
aVpowers its movements
p18
aVwith a lunate tail.
p19
aVIt's actually got a naked skin for most of its body,
p20
aVso it reduces friction with the water.
p21
aVThis is what one of nature's finest machines.
p22
aa(lp23
VNow, bluefin
p24
aVwere revered by Man
p25
aVfor all of human history.
p26
aVFor 4,000 years, we fished sustainably for this animal,
p27
aVand it's evidenced
p28
aVin the art that we see
p29
aVfrom thousands of years ago.
p30
aVBluefin are in cave paintings in France.
p31
aVThey're on coins
p32
aVthat date back 3,000 years.
p33
aVThis fish was revered by humankind.
p34
aVIt was fished sustainably
p35
aVtill all of time,
p36
aVexcept for our generation.
p37
aVBluefin are pursued wherever they go \u2014
p38
aVthere is a gold rush on Earth,
p39
aVand this is a gold rush for bluefin.
p40
aVThere are traps that fish sustainably
p41
aVup until recently.
p42
aVAnd yet, the type of fishing going on today,
p43
aVwith pens, with enormous stakes,
p44
aVis really wiping bluefin
p45
aVecologically off the planet.
p46
aVNow bluefin, in general,
p47
aVgoes to one place: Japan.
p48
aVSome of you may be guilty
p49
aVof having contributed to the demise of bluefin.
p50
aVThey're delectable muscle,
p51
aVrich in fat \u2014
p52
aVabsolutely taste delicious.
p53
aVAnd that's their problem; we're eating them to death.
p54
aVNow in the Atlantic, the story is pretty simple.
p55
aVBluefin have two populations: one large, one small.
p56
aVThe North American population
p57
aVis fished at about 2,000 ton.
p58
aVThe European population and North African \u2014 the Eastern bluefin tuna \u2014
p59
aVis fished at tremendous levels:
p60
aV50,000 tons over the last decade almost every year.
p61
aa(lp62
VThe result is whether you're looking
p63
aVat the West or the Eastern bluefin population,
p64
aVthere's been tremendous decline on both sides,
p65
aVas much as 90 percent
p66
aVif you go back with your baseline
p67
aVto 1950.
p68
aVFor that, bluefin have been given a status
p69
aVequivalent to tigers, to lions,
p70
aVto certain African elephants
p71
aVand to pandas.
p72
aVThese fish have been proposed
p73
aVfor an endangered species listing in the past two months.
p74
aVThey were voted on and rejected
p75
aVjust two weeks ago,
p76
aVdespite outstanding science
p77
aVthat shows from two committees
p78
aVthis fish meets the criteria of CITES I.
p79
aVAnd if it's tunas you don't care about,
p80
aVperhaps you might be interested
p81
aVthat international long lines and pursing
p82
aVchase down tunas and bycatch animals
p83
aVsuch as leatherbacks, sharks,
p84
aVmarlin, albatross.
p85
aVThese animals and their demise
p86
aVoccurs in the tuna fisheries.
p87
aVThe challenge we face
p88
aVis that we know very little about tuna,
p89
aVand everyone in the room knows what it looks like
p90
aVwhen an African lion
p91
aVtakes down its prey.
p92
aVI doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed.
p93
aVThis tuna symbolizes
p94
aVwhat's the problem for all of us in the room.
p95
aa(lp96
VIt's the 21st century, but we really have only just begun
p97
aVto really study our oceans in a deep way.
p98
aVTechnology has come of age
p99
aVthat's allowing us to see the Earth from space
p100
aVand go deep into the seas remotely.
p101
aVAnd we've got to use these technologies immediately
p102
aVto get a better understanding
p103
aVof how our ocean realm works.
p104
aVMost of us from the ship \u2014 even I \u2014
p105
aVlook out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea.
p106
aVWe don't know where the structure is.
p107
aVWe can't tell where are the watering holes
p108
aVlike we can on an African plain.
p109
aVWe can't see the corridors,
p110
aVand we can't see what it is
p111
aVthat brings together a tuna,
p112
aVa leatherback and an albatross.
p113
aVWe're only just beginning to understand
p114
aVhow the physical oceanography
p115
aVand the biological oceanography
p116
aVcome together
p117
aVto create a seasonal force
p118
aVthat actually causes the upwelling
p119
aVthat might make a hot spot a hope spot.
p120
aVThe reasons these challenges are great
p121
aVis that technically it's difficult to go to sea.
p122
aVIt's hard to study a bluefin on its turf,
p123
aVthe entire Pacific realm.
p124
aVIt's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark
p125
aVand try to put a tag on it.
p126
aVAnd then imagine being Bruce Mate's team from OSU,
p127
aVgetting up close to a blue whale
p128
aVand fixing a tag on the blue whale that stays,
p129
aVan engineering challenge
p130
aVwe've yet to really overcome.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo the story of our team, a dedicated team,
p133
aVis fish and chips.
p134
aVWe basically are taking
p135
aVthe same satellite phone parts,
p136
aVor the same parts that are in your computer, chips.
p137
aVWe're putting them together in unusual ways,
p138
aVand this is taking us into the ocean realm
p139
aVlike never before.
p140
aVAnd for the first time,
p141
aVwe're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean
p142
aVusing light and photons
p143
aVto measure sunrise and sunset.
p144
aVNow, I've been working with tunas for over 15 years.
p145
aVI have the privilege of being a partner
p146
aVwith the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
p147
aVWe've actually taken a sliver of the ocean,
p148
aVput it behind glass,
p149
aVand we together
p150
aVhave put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display.
p151
aVWhen the veil of bubbles lifts every morning,
p152
aVwe can actually see a community from the Pelagic ocean,
p153
aVone of the only places on Earth
p154
aVyou can see giant bluefin swim by.
p155
aVWe can see in their beauty of form and function,
p156
aVtheir ceaseless activity.
p157
aVThey're flying through their space, ocean space.
p158
aVAnd we can bring two million people a year
p159
aVinto contact with this fish
p160
aVand show them its beauty.
p161
aa(lp162
VBehind the scenes is a working lab at Stanford University
p163
aVpartnered with the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
p164
aVHere, for over 14 or 15 years,
p165
aVwe've actually brought in
p166
aVboth bluefin and yellowfin in captivity.
p167
aVWe'd been studying these fish,
p168
aVbut first we had to learn how to husbandry them.
p169
aVWhat do they like to eat?
p170
aVWhat is it that they're happy with?
p171
aVWe go in the tanks with the tuna \u2014 we touch their naked skin \u2014
p172
aVit's pretty amazing. It feels wonderful.
p173
aVAnd then, better yet,
p174
aVwe've got our own version of tuna whisperers,
p175
aVour own Chuck Farwell, Alex Norton,
p176
aVwho can take a big tuna
p177
aVand in one motion,
p178
aVput it into an envelope of water,
p179
aVso that we can actually work with the tuna
p180
aVand learn the techniques it takes
p181
aVto not injure this fish
p182
aVwho never sees a boundary in the open sea.
p183
aVJeff and Jason there, are scientists
p184
aVwho are going to take a tuna
p185
aVand put it in the equivalent of a treadmill, a flume.
p186
aVAnd that tuna thinks it's going to Japan, but it's staying in place.
p187
aVWe're actually measuring its oxygen consumption,
p188
aVits energy consumption.
p189
aVWe're taking this data and building better models.
p190
aVAnd when I see that tuna \u2014 this is my favorite view \u2014
p191
aVI begin to wonder:
p192
aVhow did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did?
p193
aVSo take a look at that animal.
p194
aVThat's the closest you'll probably ever get.
p195
aVNow, the activities from the lab
p196
aVhave taught us now how to go out in the open ocean.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo in a program called Tag-A-Giant
p199
aVwe've actually gone from Ireland to Canada,
p200
aVfrom Corsica to Spain.
p201
aVWe've fished with many nations around the world
p202
aVin an effort to basically
p203
aVput electronic computers
p204
aVinside giant tunas.
p205
aVWe've actually tagged 1,100 tunas.
p206
aVAnd I'm going to show you three clips,
p207
aVbecause I tagged 1,100 tunas.
p208
aVIt's a very hard process, but it's a ballet.
p209
aVWe bring the tuna out, we measure it.
p210
aVA team of fishers, captains, scientists and technicians
p211
aVwork together to keep this animal out of the ocean
p212
aVfor about four to five minutes.
p213
aVWe put water over its gills, give it oxygen.
p214
aVAnd then with a lot of effort, after tagging,
p215
aVputting in the computer,
p216
aVmaking sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment,
p217
aVwe send this fish back into the sea.
p218
aVAnd when it goes, we're always happy.
p219
aVWe see a flick of the tail.
p220
aVAnd from our data that gets collected,
p221
aVwhen that tag comes back,
p222
aVbecause a fisher returns it
p223
aVfor a thousand-dollar reward,
p224
aVwe can get tracks beneath the sea
p225
aVfor up to five years now,
p226
aVon a backboned animal.
p227
aa(lp228
VNow sometimes the tunas are really large,
p229
aVsuch as this fish off Nantucket.
p230
aVBut that's about half the size
p231
aVof the biggest tuna we've ever tagged.
p232
aVIt takes a human effort,
p233
aVa team effort, to bring the fish in.
p234
aVIn this case, what we're going to do
p235
aVis put a pop-up satellite archival tag on the tuna.
p236
aVThis tag rides on the tuna,
p237
aVsenses the environment around the tuna
p238
aVand actually will come off the fish,
p239
aVdetach, float to the surface
p240
aVand send back to Earth-orbiting satellites
p241
aVposition data estimated by math on the tag,
p242
aVpressure data and temperature data.
p243
aVAnd so what we get then from the pop-up satellite tag
p244
aVis we get away from having to have a human interaction
p245
aVto recapture the tag.
p246
aVBoth the electronic tags I'm talking about are expensive.
p247
aVThese tags have been engineered
p248
aVby a variety of teams in North America.
p249
aVThey are some of our finest instruments,
p250
aVour new technology in the ocean today.
p251
aVOne community in general
p252
aVhas given more to help us than any other community.
p253
aVAnd that's the fisheries off the state of North Carolina.
p254
aVThere are two villages, Harris and Morehead City,
p255
aVevery winter for over a decade,
p256
aVheld a party called Tag-A-Giant,
p257
aVand together, fishers worked with us
p258
aVto tag 800 to 900 fish.
p259
aVIn this case, we're actually going to measure the fish.
p260
aVWe're going to do something that in recent years we've started:
p261
aVtake a mucus sample.
p262
aVWatch how shiny the skin is; you can see my reflection there.
p263
aVAnd from that mucus, we can get gene profiles,
p264
aVwe can get information on gender,
p265
aVchecking the pop-up tag one more time,
p266
aVand then it's out in the ocean.
p267
aVAnd this is my favorite.
p268
aa(lp269
VWith the help of my former postdoc, Gareth Lawson,
p270
aVthis is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna.
p271
aVThis tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean.
p272
aVThe warm is the Gulf Stream,
p273
aVthe cold up there in the Gulf of Maine.
p274
aVThat's where the tuna wants to go \u2014 it wants to forage on schools of herring \u2014
p275
aVbut it can't get there. It's too cold.
p276
aVBut then it warms up, and the tuna pops in, gets some fish,
p277
aVmaybe comes back to home base,
p278
aVgoes in again
p279
aVand then comes back to winter down there in North Carolina
p280
aVand then on to the Bahamas.
p281
aVAnd my favorite scene, three tunas going into the Gulf of Mexico.
p282
aVThree tunas tagged.
p283
aVAstronomically, we're calculating positions.
p284
aVThey're coming together. That could be tuna sex \u2014
p285
aVand there it is.
p286
aVThat is where the tuna spawn.
p287
aVSo from data like this,
p288
aVwe're able now to put the map up,
p289
aVand in this map
p290
aVyou see thousands of positions
p291
aVgenerated by this decade and a half of tagging.
p292
aVAnd now we're showing that tunas on the western side
p293
aVgo to the eastern side.
p294
aVSo two populations of tunas \u2014
p295
aVthat is, we have a Gulf population, one that we can tag \u2014
p296
aVthey go to the Gulf of Mexico, I showed you that \u2014
p297
aVand a second population.
p298
aVLiving amongst our tunas \u2014 our North American tunas \u2014
p299
aVare European tunas that go back to the Med.
p300
aVOn the hot spots \u2014 the hope spots \u2014
p301
aVthey're mixed populations.
p302
aa(lp303
VAnd so what we've done with the science
p304
aVis we're showing the International Commission,
p305
aVbuilding new models,
p306
aVshowing them that a two-stock no-mixing model \u2014
p307
aVto this day, used to reject
p308
aVthe CITES treaty \u2014
p309
aVthat model isn't the right model.
p310
aVThis model, a model of overlap,
p311
aVis the way to move forward.
p312
aVSo we can then predict
p313
aVwhere management places should be.
p314
aVPlaces like the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean
p315
aVare places where the single species,
p316
aVthe single population, can be captured.
p317
aVThese become forthright in places we need to protect.
p318
aVThe center of the Atlantic where the mixing is,
p319
aVI could imagine a policy that lets Canada and America fish,
p320
aVbecause they manage their fisheries well,
p321
aVthey're doing a good job.
p322
aVBut in the international realm,
p323
aVwhere fishing and overfishing has really gone wild,
p324
aVthese are the places that we have to make hope spots in.
p325
aVThat's the size they have to be to protect the bluefin tuna.
p326
aa(lp327
VNow in a second project
p328
aVcalled Tagging of Pacific Pelagics,
p329
aVwe took on the planet as a team,
p330
aVthose of us in the Census of Marine Life.
p331
aVAnd, funded primarily through Sloan Foundation and others,
p332
aVwe were able to actually go in, in our project \u2014
p333
aVwe're one of 17 field programs
p334
aVand begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators,
p335
aVnot just tunas.
p336
aVSo what we've done
p337
aVis actually gone up to tag salmon shark in Alaska,
p338
aVmet salmon shark on their home territory,
p339
aVfollowed them catching salmon
p340
aVand then went in and figured out
p341
aVthat, if we take a salmon and put it on a line,
p342
aVwe can actually take up a salmon shark \u2014
p343
aVThis is the cousin of the white shark \u2014
p344
aVand very carefully \u2014
p345
aVnote, I say "very carefully," \u2014
p346
aVwe can actually keep it calm,
p347
aVput a hose in its mouth, keep it off the deck
p348
aVand then tag it with a satellite tag.
p349
aVThat satellite tag will now have your shark phone home
p350
aVand send in a message.
p351
aVAnd that shark leaping there, if you look carefully, has an antenna.
p352
aVIt's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag
p353
aVjumping after salmon,
p354
aVsending home its data.
p355
aVSalmon sharks aren't the only sharks we tag.
p356
aVBut there goes salmon sharks with this meter-level resolution
p357
aVon an ocean of temperature \u2014 warm colors are warmer.
p358
aVSalmon sharks go down
p359
aVto the tropics to pup
p360
aVand come into Monterey.
p361
aa(lp362
VNow right next door in Monterey and up at the Farallones
p363
aVare a white shark team led by Scott Anderson \u2014 there \u2014
p364
aVand Sal Jorgensen.
p365
aVThey can throw out a target \u2014
p366
aVit's a carpet shaped like a seal \u2014
p367
aVand in will come a white shark, a curious critter
p368
aVthat will come right up to our 16-ft. boat.
p369
aVIt's a several thousand-pound animal.
p370
aVAnd we'll wind in the target.
p371
aVAnd we'll place an acoustic tag
p372
aVthat says, "OMSHARK 10165,"
p373
aVor something like that, acoustically with a ping.
p374
aVAnd then we'll put on a satellite tag
p375
aVthat will give us the long-distance journeys
p376
aVwith the light-based geolocation algorithms
p377
aVsolved on the computer that's on the fish.
p378
aVSo in this case, Sal's looking at two tags there,
p379
aVand there they are: the white sharks of California
p380
aVgoing off to the white shark cafe and coming back.
p381
aVWe also tag makos with our NOAA colleagues,
p382
aVblue sharks.
p383
aVAnd now, together, what we can see
p384
aVon this ocean of color that's temperature,
p385
aVwe can see ten-day worms of makos and salmon sharks.
p386
aVWe have white sharks and blue sharks.
p387
aVFor the first time,
p388
aVan ecoscape as large as ocean-scale,
p389
aVshowing where the sharks go.
p390
aa(lp391
VThe tuna team from TOPP has done the unthinkable:
p392
aVthree teams tagged 1,700 tunas,
p393
aVbluefin, yellowfin and albacore
p394
aVall at the same time \u2014
p395
aVcarefully rehearsed tagging programs
p396
aVin which we go out, pick up juvenile tunas,
p397
aVput in the tags that actually have the sensors,
p398
aVstick out the tuna
p399
aVand then let them go.
p400
aVThey get returned, and when they get returned,
p401
aVhere on a NASA numerical ocean
p402
aVyou can see bluefin in blue
p403
aVgo across their corridor,
p404
aVreturning to the Western Pacific.
p405
aa(lp406
VOur team from UCSC has tagged elephant seals
p407
aVwith tags that are glued on their heads, that come off when they slough.
p408
aVThese elephant seals cover half an ocean,
p409
aVtake data down to 1,800 feet \u2014
p410
aVamazing data.
p411
aVAnd then there's Scott Shaffer and our shearwaters
p412
aVwearing tuna tags, light-based tags,
p413
aVthat now are going to take you from New Zealand to Monterey and back,
p414
aVjourneys of 35,000 nautical miles
p415
aVwe had never seen before.
p416
aVBut now with light-based geolocation tags that are very small,
p417
aVwe can actually see these journeys.
p418
aVSame thing with Laysan albatross
p419
aVwho travel an entire ocean
p420
aVon a trip sometimes,
p421
aVup to the same zone the tunas use.
p422
aVYou can see why they might be caught.
p423
aVThen there's George Schillinger and our leatherback team out of Playa Grande
p424
aVtagging leatherbacks
p425
aVthat go right past where we are.
p426
aVAnd Scott Benson's team
p427
aVthat showed that leatherbacks go from Indonesia
p428
aVall the way to Monterey.
p429
aVSo what we can see on this moving ocean
p430
aVis we can finally see where the predators are.
p431
aVWe can actually see how they're using ecospaces
p432
aVas large as an ocean.
p433
aa(lp434
VAnd from this information,
p435
aVwe can begin to map the hope spots.
p436
aVSo this is just three years of data right here \u2014
p437
aVand there's a decade of this data.
p438
aVWe see the pulse and the seasonal activities
p439
aVthat these animals are going on.
p440
aVSo what we're able to do with this information
p441
aVis boil it down to hot spots,
p442
aV4,000 deployments,
p443
aVa huge herculean task,
p444
aV2,000 tags
p445
aVin an area, shown here for the first time,
p446
aVoff the California coast,
p447
aVthat appears to be a gathering place.
p448
aVAnd then for sort of an encore from these animals,
p449
aVthey're helping us.
p450
aVThey're carrying instruments
p451
aVthat are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters.
p452
aVThey're taking information from our planet
p453
aVat very critical places like Antarctica and the Poles.
p454
aVThose are seals from many countries
p455
aVbeing released
p456
aVwho are sampling underneath the ice sheets
p457
aVand giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality
p458
aVon both poles.
p459
aa(lp460
VThis data, when visualized, is captivating to watch.
p461
aVWe still haven't figured out best how to visualize the data.
p462
aVAnd then, as these animals swim
p463
aVand give us the information
p464
aVthat's important to climate issues,
p465
aVwe also think it's critical
p466
aVto get this information to the public,
p467
aVto engage the public with this kind of data.
p468
aVWe did this with the Great Turtle Race \u2014
p469
aVtagged turtles, brought in four million hits.
p470
aVAnd now with Google's Oceans,
p471
aVwe can actually put a white shark in that ocean.
p472
aVAnd when we do and it swims,
p473
aVwe see this magnificent bathymetry
p474
aVthat the shark knows is there on its path
p475
aVas it goes from California to Hawaii.
p476
aVBut maybe Mission Blue
p477
aVcan fill in that ocean that we can't see.
p478
aVWe've got the capacity, NASA has the ocean.
p479
aVWe just need to put it together.
p480
aa(lp481
VSo in conclusion,
p482
aVwe know where Yellowstone is for North America;
p483
aVit's off our coast.
p484
aVWe have the technology that's shown us where it is.
p485
aVWhat we need to think about perhaps for Mission Blue
p486
aVis increasing the biologging capacity.
p487
aVHow is it that we can actually
p488
aVtake this type of activity elsewhere?
p489
aVAnd then finally \u2014 to basically get the message home \u2014
p490
aVmaybe use live links
p491
aVfrom animals such as blue whales and white sharks.
p492
aVMake killer apps, if you will.
p493
aVA lot of people are excited
p494
aVwhen sharks actually went under the Golden Gate Bridge.
p495
aVLet's connect the public to this activity right on their iPhone.
p496
aVThat way we do away with a few internet myths.
p497
aa(lp498
VSo we can save the bluefin tuna.
p499
aVWe can save the white shark.
p500
aVWe have the science and technology.
p501
aVHope is here. Yes we can.
p502
aVWe need just to apply this capacity
p503
aVfurther in the oceans.
p504
aa(lp505
VThank you.

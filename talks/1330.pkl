VDo you know how many choices you make
p5
aVin a typical day?
p6
aVDo you know how many choices you make
p7
aVin typical week?
p8
aVI recently did a survey
p9
aVwith over 2,000 Americans,
p10
aVand the average number of choices
p11
aVthat the typical American reports making
p12
aVis about 70 in a typical day.
p13
aVThere was also recently a study done with CEOs
p14
aVin which they followed CEOs around for a whole week.
p15
aVAnd these scientists simply documented all the various tasks
p16
aVthat these CEOs engaged in
p17
aVand how much time they spent engaging
p18
aVin making decisions related to these tasks.
p19
aVAnd they found that the average CEO
p20
aVengaged in about 139 tasks in a week.
p21
aVEach task was made up of many, many, many sub-choices of course.
p22
aV50 percent of their decisions
p23
aVwere made in nine minutes or less.
p24
aVOnly about 12 percent of the decisions
p25
aVdid they make an hour or more of their time.
p26
aVThink about your own choices.
p27
aVDo you know how many choices
p28
aVmake it into your nine minute category
p29
aVversus your one hour category?
p30
aVHow well do you think you're doing
p31
aVat managing those choices?
p32
aa(lp33
VToday I want to talk
p34
aVabout one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have,
p35
aVwhich is the choice overload problem.
p36
aVI want to talk about the problem
p37
aVand some potential solutions.
p38
aVNow as I talk about this problem,
p39
aVI'm going to have some questions for you
p40
aVand I'm going to want to know your answers.
p41
aVSo when I ask you a question,
p42
aVsince I'm blind,
p43
aVonly raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories.
p44
aV(Laughter)
p45
aVOtherwise, when I ask you a question,
p46
aVand if your answer is yes,
p47
aVI'd like you to clap your hands.
p48
aVSo for my first question for you today:
p49
aVAre you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem?
p50
aV(Applause)
p51
aVThank you.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo when I was a graduate student at Stanford University,
p54
aVI used to go to this very, very upscale grocery store;
p55
aVat least at that time it was truly upscale.
p56
aVIt was a store called Draeger's.
p57
aVNow this store, it was almost like going to an amusement park.
p58
aVThey had 250 different kinds of mustards and vinegars
p59
aVand over 500 different kinds
p60
aVof fruits and vegetables
p61
aVand more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water \u2014
p62
aVand this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water.
p63
aVI used to love going to this store,
p64
aVbut on one occasion I asked myself,
p65
aVwell how come you never buy anything?
p66
aVHere's their olive oil aisle.
p67
aVThey had over 75 different kinds of olive oil,
p68
aVincluding those that were in a locked case
p69
aVthat came from thousand-year-old olive trees.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager,
p72
aVand I asked the manager,
p73
aV"Is this model of offering people all this choice really working?"
p74
aVAnd he pointed to the busloads of tourists
p75
aVthat would show up everyday,
p76
aVwith cameras ready usually.
p77
aVWe decided to do a little experiment,
p78
aVand we picked jam for our experiment.
p79
aVHere's their jam aisle.
p80
aVThey had 348 different kinds of jam.
p81
aVWe set up a little tasting booth
p82
aVright near the entrance of the store.
p83
aVWe there put out six different flavors of jam
p84
aVor 24 different flavors of jam,
p85
aVand we looked at two things:
p86
aVFirst, in which case
p87
aVwere people more likely to stop, sample some jam?
p88
aVMore people stopped when there were 24, about 60 percent,
p89
aVthan when there were six,
p90
aVabout 40 percent.
p91
aVThe next thing we looked at
p92
aVis in which case were people more likely
p93
aVto buy a jar of jam.
p94
aVNow we see the opposite effect.
p95
aVOf the people who stopped when there were 24,
p96
aVonly three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam.
p97
aVOf the people who stopped when there were six,
p98
aVwell now we saw that 30 percent of them
p99
aVactually bought a jar of jam.
p100
aVNow if you do the math,
p101
aVpeople were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam
p102
aVif they encountered six
p103
aVthan if they encountered 24.
p104
aa(lp105
VNow choosing not to buy a jar of jam
p106
aVis probably good for us \u2014
p107
aVat least it's good for our waistlines \u2014
p108
aVbut it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us
p109
aVeven in very consequential decisions.
p110
aVWe choose not to choose,
p111
aVeven when it goes against our best self-interests.
p112
aVSo now for the topic of today: financial savings.
p113
aVNow I'm going to describe to you a study I did
p114
aVwith Gur Huberman, Emir Kamenica, Wei Jang
p115
aVwhere we looked at the retirement savings decisions
p116
aVof nearly a million Americans
p117
aVfrom about 650 plans
p118
aVall in the U.S.
p119
aVAnd what we looked at
p120
aVwas whether the number of fund offerings
p121
aVavailable in a retirement savings plan,
p122
aVthe 401(k) plan,
p123
aVdoes that affect people's likelihood
p124
aVto save more for tomorrow.
p125
aVAnd what we found
p126
aVwas that indeed there was a correlation.
p127
aVSo in these plans, we had about 657 plans
p128
aVthat ranged from offering people
p129
aVanywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings.
p130
aVAnd what we found was that,
p131
aVthe more funds offered,
p132
aVindeed, there was less participation rate.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo if you look at the extremes,
p135
aVthose plans that offered you two funds,
p136
aVparticipation rates were around in the mid-70s \u2014
p137
aVstill not as high as we want it to be.
p138
aVIn those plans that offered nearly 60 funds,
p139
aVparticipation rates have now dropped
p140
aVto about the 60th percentile.
p141
aVNow it turns out
p142
aVthat even if you do choose to participate
p143
aVwhen there are more choices present,
p144
aVeven then, it has negative consequences.
p145
aVSo for those people who did choose to participate,
p146
aVthe more choices available,
p147
aVthe more likely people were
p148
aVto completely avoid stocks or equity funds.
p149
aVThe more choices available,
p150
aVthe more likely they were
p151
aVto put all their money in pure money market accounts.
p152
aVNow neither of these extreme decisions
p153
aVare the kinds of decisions
p154
aVthat any of us would recommend for people
p155
aVwhen you're considering their future financial well-being.
p156
aa(lp157
VWell, over the past decade,
p158
aVwe have observed three main negative consequences
p159
aVto offering people more and more choices.
p160
aVThey're more likely to delay choosing \u2014
p161
aVprocrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest.
p162
aVThey're more likely to make worse choices \u2014
p163
aVworse financial choices, medical choices.
p164
aVThey're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied,
p165
aVeven when they do objectively better.
p166
aVThe main reason for this
p167
aVis because, we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls
p168
aVof mayonnaises, mustards, vinegars, jams,
p169
aVbut we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting
p170
aVand actually picking from that stunning display.
p171
aVSo what I want to propose to you today
p172
aVare four simple techniques \u2014
p173
aVtechniques that we have tested in one way or another
p174
aVin different research venues \u2014
p175
aVthat you can easily apply
p176
aVin your businesses.
p177
aa(lp178
VThe first: Cut.
p179
aVYou've heard it said before,
p180
aVbut it's never been more true than today,
p181
aVthat less is more.
p182
aVPeople are always upset when I say, "Cut."
p183
aVThey're always worried they're going to lose shelf space.
p184
aVBut in fact, what we're seeing more and more
p185
aVis that if you are willing to cut,
p186
aVget rid of those extraneous redundant options,
p187
aVwell there's an increase in sales,
p188
aVthere's a lowering of costs,
p189
aVthere is an improvement of the choosing experience.
p190
aVWhen Proctor & Gamble
p191
aVwent from 26 different kinds of Head & Shoulders to 15,
p192
aVthey saw an increase in sales by 10 percent.
p193
aVWhen the Golden Cat Corporation
p194
aVgot rid of their 10 worst-selling cat litter products,
p195
aVthey saw an increase in profits
p196
aVby 87 percent \u2014
p197
aVa function of both increase in sales
p198
aVand lowering of costs.
p199
aVYou know, the average grocery store today
p200
aVoffers you 45,000 products.
p201
aVThe typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products.
p202
aVBut the ninth largest retailer,
p203
aVthe ninth biggest retailer in the world today
p204
aVis Aldi,
p205
aVand it offers you only 1,400 products \u2014
p206
aVone kind of canned tomato sauce.
p207
aa(lp208
VNow in the financial savings world,
p209
aVI think one of the best examples that has recently come out
p210
aVon how to best manage the choice offerings
p211
aVhas actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing,
p212
aVwhich was the program that they have at Harvard.
p213
aVEvery single Harvard employee
p214
aVis now automatically enrolled
p215
aVin a lifecycle fund.
p216
aVFor those people who actually want to choose,
p217
aVthey're given 20 funds,
p218
aVnot 300 or more funds.
p219
aVYou know, often, people say,
p220
aV"I don't know how to cut.
p221
aVThey're all important choices."
p222
aVAnd the first thing I do is I ask the employees,
p223
aV"Tell me how these choices are different from one another.
p224
aVAnd if your employees can't tell them apart,
p225
aVneither can your consumers."
p226
aa(lp227
VNow before we started our session this afternoon,
p228
aVI had a chat with Gary.
p229
aVAnd Gary said that he would be willing
p230
aVto offer people in this audience
p231
aVan all-expenses-paid free vacation
p232
aVto the most beautiful road in the world.
p233
aVHere's a description of the road.
p234
aVAnd I'd like you to read it.
p235
aVAnd now I'll give you a few seconds to read it
p236
aVand then I want you to clap your hands
p237
aVif you're ready to take Gary up on his offer.
p238
aV(Light clapping)
p239
aVOkay. Anybody who's ready to take him up on his offer.
p240
aVIs that all?
p241
aVAll right, let me show you some more about this.
p242
aV(Laughter)
p243
aVYou guys knew there was a trick, didn't you.
p244
aV(Honk)
p245
aVNow who's ready to go on this trip.
p246
aV(Applause)
p247
aV(Laughter)
p248
aVI think I might have actually heard more hands.
p249
aa(lp250
VAll right.
p251
aVNow in fact,
p252
aVyou had objectively more information
p253
aVthe first time around than the second time around,
p254
aVbut I would venture to guess
p255
aVthat you felt that it was more real the second time around.
p256
aVBecause the pictures made it feel
p257
aVmore real to you.
p258
aVWhich brings me to the second technique
p259
aVfor handling the choice overload problem,
p260
aVwhich is concretization.
p261
aVThat in order for people to understand
p262
aVthe differences between the choices,
p263
aVthey have to be able to understand
p264
aVthe consequences associated with each choice,
p265
aVand that the consequences need to be felt
p266
aVin a vivid sort of way, in a very concrete way.
p267
aVWhy do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more
p268
aVwhen they use an ATM card or a credit card
p269
aVas opposed to cash?
p270
aVBecause it doesn't feel like real money.
p271
aVAnd it turns out
p272
aVthat making it feel more concrete
p273
aVcan actually be a very positive tool
p274
aVto use in getting people to save more.
p275
aa(lp276
VSo a study that I did with Shlomo Benartzi
p277
aVand Alessandro Previtero,
p278
aVwe did a study with people at ING \u2014
p279
aVemployees that are all working at ING \u2014
p280
aVand now these people were all in a session
p281
aVwhere they're doing enrollment for their 401(k) plan.
p282
aVAnd during that session,
p283
aVwe kept the session exactly the way it used to be,
p284
aVbut we added one little thing.
p285
aVThe one little thing we added
p286
aVwas we asked people
p287
aVto just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life
p288
aVif you saved more.
p289
aVBy doing that simple thing,
p290
aVthere was an increase in enrollment by 20 percent
p291
aVand there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save
p292
aVor the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account
p293
aVby four percent.
p294
aa(lp295
VThe third technique: Categorization.
p296
aVWe can handle more categories
p297
aVthan we can handle choices.
p298
aVSo for example,
p299
aVhere's a study we did in a magazine aisle.
p300
aVIt turns out that in Wegmans grocery stores
p301
aVup and down the northeast corridor,
p302
aVthe magazine aisles range anywhere
p303
aVfrom 331 different kinds of magazines
p304
aVall the way up to 664.
p305
aVBut you know what?
p306
aVIf I show you 600 magazines
p307
aVand I divide them up into 10 categories,
p308
aVversus I show you 400 magazines
p309
aVand divide them up into 20 categories,
p310
aVyou believe that I have given you
p311
aVmore choice and a better choosing experience
p312
aVif I gave you the 400
p313
aVthan if I gave you the 600.
p314
aVBecause the categories tell me how to tell them apart.
p315
aa(lp316
VHere are two different jewelry displays.
p317
aVOne is called "Jazz" and the other one is called "Swing."
p318
aVIf you think the display on the left is Swing
p319
aVand the display on the right is Jazz,
p320
aVclap your hands.
p321
aV(Light Clapping)
p322
aVOkay, there's some.
p323
aVIf you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,
p324
aVclap your hands.
p325
aVOkay, a bit more.
p326
aVNow it turns out you're right.
p327
aVThe one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,
p328
aVbut you know what?
p329
aVThis is a highly useless categorization scheme.
p330
aV(Laughter)
p331
aVThe categories need to say something
p332
aVto the chooser, not the choice-maker.
p333
aVAnd you often see that problem
p334
aVwhen it comes down to those long lists of all these funds.
p335
aVWho are they actually supposed to be informing?
p336
aa(lp337
VMy fourth technique: Condition for complexity.
p338
aVIt turns out we can actually
p339
aVhandle a lot more information than we think we can,
p340
aVwe've just got to take it a little easier.
p341
aVWe have to gradually increase the complexity.
p342
aVI'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking about.
p343
aVLet's take a very, very complicated decision:
p344
aVbuying a car.
p345
aVHere's a German car manufacturer
p346
aVthat gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car.
p347
aVYou've got to make 60 different decisions,
p348
aVcompletely make up your car.
p349
aVNow these decisions vary
p350
aVin the number of choices that they offer per decision.
p351
aVCar colors, exterior car colors \u2014
p352
aVI've got 56 choices.
p353
aVEngines, gearshift \u2014 four choices.
p354
aVSo now what I'm going to do
p355
aVis I'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear.
p356
aVSo half of the customers
p357
aVare going to go from high choice, 56 car colors,
p358
aVto low choice, four gearshifts.
p359
aVThe other half of the customers
p360
aVare going to go from low choice, four gearshifts,
p361
aVto 56 car colors, high choice.
p362
aa(lp363
VWhat am I going to look at?
p364
aVHow engaged you are.
p365
aVIf you keep hitting the default button per decision,
p366
aVthat means you're getting overwhelmed,
p367
aVthat means I'm losing you.
p368
aVWhat you find
p369
aVis the people who go from high choice to low choice,
p370
aVthey're hitting that default button over and over and over again.
p371
aVWe're losing them.
p372
aVThey go from low choice to high choice,
p373
aVthey're hanging in there.
p374
aVIt's the same information. It's the same number of choices.
p375
aVThe only thing that I have done
p376
aVis I have varied the order
p377
aVin which that information is presented.
p378
aVIf I start you off easy,
p379
aVI learn how to choose.
p380
aVEven though choosing gearshift
p381
aVdoesn't tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor,
p382
aVit still prepares me for how to choose.
p383
aVIt also gets me excited about this big product that I'm putting together,
p384
aVso I'm more willing to be motivated
p385
aVto be engaged.
p386
aa(lp387
VSo let me recap.
p388
aVI have talked about four techniques
p389
aVfor mitigating the problem of choice overload \u2014
p390
aVcut \u2014 get rid of the extraneous alternatives;
p391
aVconcretize \u2014 make it real;
p392
aVcategorize \u2014 we can handle more categories, less choices;
p393
aVcondition for complexity.
p394
aVAll of these techniques that I'm describing to you today
p395
aVare designed to help you manage your choices \u2014
p396
aVbetter for you, you can use them on yourself,
p397
aVbetter for the people that you are serving.
p398
aVBecause I believe that the key
p399
aVto getting the most from choice
p400
aVis to be choosy about choosing.
p401
aVAnd the more we're able to be choosy about choosing
p402
aVthe better we will be able
p403
aVto practice the art of choosing.
p404
aa(lp405
VThank you very much.

VI thought I would think about changing your perspective on the world a bit,
p5
aVand showing you some of the designs that we have in nature.
p6
aVAnd so, I have my first slide to talk about
p7
aVthe dawning of the universe and what I call
p8
aVthe cosmic scene investigation, that is, looking at
p9
aVthe relics of creation and inferring what happened at the beginning,
p10
aVand then following it up and trying to understand it.
p11
aa(lp12
VAnd so one of the questions that I asked you is,
p13
aVwhen you look around, what do you see?
p14
aVWell, you see this space that's created by designers
p15
aVand by the work of people, but what you actually see
p16
aVis a lot of material that was already here,
p17
aVbeing reshaped in a certain form.
p18
aVAnd so the question is: how did that material get here?
p19
aVHow did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped, and so forth?
p20
aVIt's a question of what's the continuity?
p21
aVSo one of the things I look at is,
p22
aVhow did the universe begin and shape?
p23
aVWhat was the whole process in the creation and the evolution of the universe
p24
aVto getting to the point that we have these kinds of materials?
p25
aa(lp26
VSo that's sort of the part, and let me move on then and show you
p27
aVthe Hubble Ultra Deep Field.
p28
aVIf you look at this picture,
p29
aVwhat you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in it.
p30
aVAnd everything but \u2014 four of these light objects are stars,
p31
aVand you can see them there \u2014 little pluses.
p32
aVThis is a star, this is a star, everything else is a galaxy, OK?
p33
aVSo there's a couple of thousand galaxies
p34
aVyou can see easily with your eye in here.
p35
aVAnd when I look out at particularly this galaxy,
p36
aVwhich looks a lot like ours, I wonder if there's
p37
aVan art design college conference going on,
p38
aVand intelligent beings there are thinking about, you know,
p39
aVwhat designs they might do, and there might be a few cosmologists
p40
aVtrying to understand where the universe itself came from,
p41
aVand there might even be some in that galaxy looking at ours
p42
aVtrying to figure out what's going on over here.
p43
aa(lp44
VBut there's a lot of other galaxies, and some are nearby,
p45
aVand they're kind of the color of the Sun,
p46
aVand some are further away and they're a little bluer, and so forth.
p47
aVBut one of the questions is \u2014 this should be, to you \u2014
p48
aVhow come there are so many galaxies?
p49
aVBecause this represents a very clean fraction of the sky.
p50
aVThis is only 1,000 galaxies.
p51
aVWe think there's on the order \u2014 visible to the Hubble Space Telescope,
p52
aVif you had the time to scan it around \u2014
p53
aVabout 100 billion galaxies. Right?
p54
aVIt's a very large number of galaxies.
p55
aVAnd that's roughly how many stars there are in our own galaxy.
p56
aa(lp57
VBut when you look at some of these regions like this, you'll see
p58
aVmore galaxies than stars, which is kind of a conundrum.
p59
aVSo the question should come to your mind is, what kind of design, you know,
p60
aVwhat kind of creative process and what kind of design
p61
aVproduced the world like that?
p62
aVAnd then I'm going to show you it's actually a lot more complicated.
p63
aVWe're going to try and follow it up.
p64
aVWe have a tool that actually helps us out in this study,
p65
aVand that's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big
p66
aVthat it's a time machine, in a certain sense.
p67
aVWe draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it.
p68
aVPut the Earth at the center of the nested spheres,
p69
aVjust because that's where we're making observations.
p70
aVAnd the moon is only two seconds away, so if you take a picture of the moon
p71
aVusing ordinary light, it's the moon two seconds ago, and who cares.
p72
aVTwo seconds is like the present.
p73
aVThe Sun is eight minutes ago. That's not such a big deal, right,
p74
aVunless there's solar flares coming then you want to get out the way.
p75
aVYou'd like to have a little advance warning.
p76
aa(lp77
VBut you get out to Jupiter and it's 40 minutes away. It's a problem.
p78
aVYou hear about Mars, it's a problem communicating to Mars
p79
aVbecause it takes light long enough to go there.
p80
aVBut if you look out to the nearest set of stars,
p81
aVto the nearest 40 or 50 stars, it's about 10 years.
p82
aVSo if you take a picture of what's going on, it's 10 years ago.
p83
aVBut you go and look to the center of the galaxy,
p84
aVit's thousands of years ago.
p85
aVIf you look at Andromeda, which is the nearest big galaxy,
p86
aVand it's two million years ago.
p87
aVIf you took a picture of the Earth two million years ago,
p88
aVthere'd be no evidence of humans at all,
p89
aVbecause we don't think there were humans yet.
p90
aVI mean, it just gives you the scale.
p91
aVWith the Hubble Space Telescope, we're looking at
p92
aVhundreds of millions of years to a billion years.
p93
aa(lp94
VBut if we were capable to come up with an idea of how to look even further \u2014
p95
aVthere's some things even further,
p96
aVand that was what I did in a lot of my work,
p97
aVwas to develop the techniques \u2014 we could look out back to even earlier
p98
aVepochs before there were stars and before there were galaxies,
p99
aVback to when the universe was hot and dense and very different.
p100
aVAnd so that's the sort of sequence,
p101
aVand so I have a more artistic impression of this.
p102
aVThere's the galaxy in the middle, which is the Milky Way,
p103
aVand around that are the Hubble \u2014 you know, nearby kind of galaxies,
p104
aVand there's a sphere that marks the different times.
p105
aVAnd behind that are some more modern galaxies.
p106
aa(lp107
VYou see the whole big picture?
p108
aVThe beginning of time is funny \u2014 it's on the outside, right?
p109
aVAnd then there's a part of the universe we can't see
p110
aVbecause it's so dense and so hot, light can't escape.
p111
aVIt's like you can't see to the center of the Sun;
p112
aVyou have to use other techniques to know what's going on inside the Sun.
p113
aVBut you can see the edge of the Sun,
p114
aVand the universe gets that way, and you can see that.
p115
aVAnd then you see this sort of model area around the outside,
p116
aVand that is the radiation coming from the Big Bang,
p117
aVwhich is actually incredibly uniform.
p118
aVThe universe is almost a perfect sphere,
p119
aVbut there are these very tiny variations
p120
aVwhich we show here in great exaggeration.
p121
aVAnd from them in the time sequence we're going to have to go
p122
aVfrom these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and first stars
p123
aVto these more advanced galaxies, and eventually the solar system, and so forth.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo it's a big design job,
p126
aVbut we'll see about how things are going on.
p127
aVSo the way these measurements were done,
p128
aVthere's been a set of satellites, and this is where you get to see.
p129
aVSo there was the COBE satellite, which was launched in 1989,
p130
aVand we discovered these variations.
p131
aVAnd then in 2000, the MAP satellite was launched \u2014 the WMAP \u2014
p132
aVand it made somewhat better pictures.
p133
aVAnd later this year \u2014 this is the cool stealth version,
p134
aVthe one that actually has some beautiful design features to it,
p135
aVand you should look \u2014 the Planck satellite will be launched,
p136
aVand it will make very high-resolution maps.
p137
aVAnd that will be the sequence of understanding
p138
aVthe very beginning of the universe.
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd what we saw was, we saw these variations, and then they told us
p141
aVthe secrets, both about the structure of space-time,
p142
aVand about the contents of the universe,
p143
aVand about how the universe started in its original motions.
p144
aVSo we have this picture, which is quite a spectacular picture,
p145
aVand I'll come back to the beginning, where we're going to have
p146
aVsome mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning.
p147
aVAnd we go through a period of accelerating expansion, and the universe
p148
aVexpands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent,
p149
aVthen to the Dark Ages, and then the first stars turn on,
p150
aVand they evolve into galaxies, and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies.
p151
aVAnd somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming.
p152
aVAnd it's maturing up to the present time.
p153
aVAnd there's some spectacular things.
p154
aVAnd this wastebasket part, that's to represent
p155
aVwhat the structure of space-time itself is doing during this period.
p156
aVAnd so this is a pretty weird model, right?
p157
aVWhat kind of evidence do we have for that?
p158
aa(lp159
VSo let me show you some of nature's patterns
p160
aVthat are the result of this.
p161
aVI always think of space-time as being the real substance of space,
p162
aVand the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean.
p163
aVIt's a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever went on.
p164
aVSo here is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey showing the location of a million galaxies.
p165
aVSo there's a dot on here for every galaxy.
p166
aVThey go out and point a telescope at the sky, take a picture,
p167
aVidentify what are stars and throw them away, look at the galaxies,
p168
aVestimate how far away they are, and plot them up.
p169
aVAnd just put radially they're going out that way.
p170
aVAnd you see these structures, this thing we call the Great Wall,
p171
aVbut there are voids and those kinds of stuff, and they kind of fade out
p172
aVbecause the telescope isn't sensitive enough to do it.
p173
aa(lp174
VNow I'm going to show you this in 3D.
p175
aVWhat happens is, you take pictures
p176
aVas the Earth rotates, you get a fan across the sky.
p177
aVThere are some places you can't look because of our own galaxy,
p178
aVor because there are no telescopes available to do it.
p179
aVSo the next picture shows you the three-dimensional version of this rotating around.
p180
aVDo you see the fan-like scans made across the sky?
p181
aVRemember, every spot on here is a galaxy, and you see the galaxies,
p182
aVyou know, sort of in our neighborhood, and you sort of see the structure.
p183
aVAnd you see this thing we call the Great Wall,
p184
aVand you see the complicated structure, and you see these voids.
p185
aVThere are places where there are no galaxies and there are places
p186
aVwhere there are thousands of galaxies clumped together, right.
p187
aVSo there's an interesting pattern,
p188
aVbut we don't have enough data here to actually see the pattern.
p189
aVWe only have a million galaxies, right?
p190
aVSo we're keeping, like, a million balls in the air
p191
aVbut, what's going on?
p192
aVThere's another survey which is very similar to this,
p193
aVcalled the Two-degree Field of View Galaxy Redshift Survey.
p194
aa(lp195
VNow we're going to fly through it at warp a million.
p196
aVAnd every time there's a galaxy \u2014 at its location there's a galaxy \u2014
p197
aVand if we know anything about the galaxy, which we do,
p198
aVbecause there's a redshift measurement and everything,
p199
aVyou put in the type of galaxy and the color,
p200
aVso this is the real representation.
p201
aVAnd when you're in the middle of the galaxies
p202
aVit's hard to see the pattern; it's like being in the middle of life.
p203
aVIt's hard to see the pattern in the middle of the audience,
p204
aVit's hard to see the pattern of this.
p205
aVSo we're going to go out and swing around and look back at this.
p206
aVAnd you'll see, first, the structure of the survey,
p207
aVand then you'll start seeing the structure of the galaxies
p208
aVthat we see out there.
p209
aVSo again, you can see the extension of this Great Wall of galaxies showing up here.
p210
aa(lp211
VBut you can see the voids,
p212
aVyou can see the complicated structure, and you say,
p213
aVwell, how did this happen?
p214
aVSuppose you're the cosmic designer.
p215
aVHow are you going to put galaxies out there in a pattern like that?
p216
aVIt's not just throwing them out at random.
p217
aVThere's a more complicated process going on here.
p218
aVHow are you going to end up doing that?
p219
aVAnd so now we're in for some serious play.
p220
aVThat is, we have to seriously play God,
p221
aVnot just change people's lives, but make the universe, right.
p222
aVSo if that's your responsibility, how are you going to do that?
p223
aVWhat's the kind of technique?
p224
aVWhat's the kind of thing you're going to do?
p225
aa(lp226
VSo I'm going to show you the results of a very large-scale simulation
p227
aVof what we think the universe might be like, using, essentially,
p228
aVsome of the play principles and some of the design principles that,
p229
aVyou know, humans have labored so hard to pick up,
p230
aVbut apparently nature knew how to do at the beginning.
p231
aVAnd that is, you start out with very simple ingredients
p232
aVand some simple rules,
p233
aVbut you have to have enough ingredients to make it complicated.
p234
aVAnd then you put in some randomness,
p235
aVsome fluctuations and some randomness,
p236
aVand realize a whole bunch of different representations.
p237
aa(lp238
VSo what I'm going to do is show you
p239
aVthe distribution of matter as a function of scales.
p240
aVWe're going to zoom in, but this is a plot of what it is.
p241
aVAnd we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right.
p242
aVIt's called dark matter.
p243
aVThat is matter that doesn't interact with light
p244
aVthe typical way that ordinary matter does,
p245
aVthe way the light's shining on me or on the stage.
p246
aVIt's transparent to light, but in order for you to see it,
p247
aVwe're going to make it white. OK?
p248
aVSo the stuff that's in this picture that's white, that is the dark matter.
p249
aVIt should be called invisible matter,
p250
aVbut the dark matter we've made visible.
p251
aVAnd the stuff that is in the yellow color,
p252
aVthat is the ordinary kind of matter that's turned into stars and galaxies.
p253
aa(lp254
VSo I'll show you the next movie.
p255
aVSo this \u2014 we're going to zoom in.
p256
aVNotice this pattern and pay attention to this pattern.
p257
aVWe're going to zoom in and zoom in.
p258
aVAnd you'll see there are all these filaments and structures and voids.
p259
aVAnd when a number of filaments come together in a knot,
p260
aVthat makes a supercluster of galaxies.
p261
aVThis one we're zooming in on
p262
aVis somewhere between 100,000 and a million galaxies in that small region.
p263
aVSo we live in the boonies.
p264
aVWe don't live in the center of the solar system,
p265
aVwe don't live in the center of the galaxy
p266
aVand our galaxy's not in the center of the cluster.
p267
aa(lp268
VSo we're zooming in.
p269
aVThis is a region which probably has more than 100,000,
p270
aVon the order of a million galaxies in that region.
p271
aVWe're going to keep zooming in. OK.
p272
aVAnd so I forgot to tell you the scale.
p273
aVA parsec is 3.26 light years.
p274
aVSo a gigaparsec is three billion light years \u2014 that's the scale.
p275
aVSo it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance.
p276
aVNow we're into a distance sort of between here and here.
p277
aVThat's the distance between us and Andromeda, right?
p278
aVThese little specks that you're seeing in here, they're galaxies.
p279
aa(lp280
VNow we're going to zoom back out,
p281
aVand you can see this structure that,
p282
aVwhen we get very far out, looks very regular,
p283
aVbut it's made up of a lot of irregular variations.
p284
aVSo they're simple building blocks.
p285
aVThere's a very simple fluid to begin with.
p286
aVIt's got dark matter, it's got ordinary matter,
p287
aVit's got photons and it's got neutrinos,
p288
aVwhich don't play much role in the later part of the universe.
p289
aVAnd it's just a simple fluid and it, over time,
p290
aVdevelops into this complicated structure.
p291
aVAnd so you know when you first saw this picture,
p292
aVit didn't mean quite so much to you.
p293
aVHere you're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe
p294
aVand you're seeing billions of galaxies, right, and nodes,
p295
aVbut you realize they're not even the main structure.
p296
aVThere's a framework, which is the dark matter, the invisible matter,
p297
aVthat's out there that's actually holding it all together.
p298
aa(lp299
VSo let's fly through it, and you can see how much harder it is
p300
aVwhen you're in the middle of something to figure this out.
p301
aVSo here's that same end result.
p302
aVYou see a filament,
p303
aVyou see the light is the invisible matter,
p304
aVand the yellow is the stars or the galaxies showing up.
p305
aVAnd we're going to fly around, and we'll fly around,
p306
aVand you'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect,
p307
aVand you get a large cluster of galaxies.
p308
aVAnd then we'll fly in to where the very large cluster is,
p309
aVand you can see what it looks like.
p310
aVAnd so from inside, it doesn't look very complicated, right?
p311
aVIt's only when you look at it at a very large scale,
p312
aVand explore it and so forth, you realize it's a very intricate,
p313
aVcomplicated kind of a design, right?
p314
aVAnd it's grown up in some kind of way.
p315
aa(lp316
VSo the question is,
p317
aVhow hard would it be to assemble this, right?
p318
aVHow big a contractor team would you need
p319
aVto put this universe together, right?
p320
aVThat's the issue, right?
p321
aVAnd so here we are.
p322
aVYou see how the filament \u2014
p323
aVyou see how several filaments are coming together,
p324
aVtherefore making this supercluster of galaxies.
p325
aVAnd you have to understand, this is not how it would actually look
p326
aVif you \u2014 first, you can't travel this fast,
p327
aVeverything would be distorted,
p328
aVbut this is using simple rendering and graphic arts kind of stuff.
p329
aVThis is how, if you took billions of years to go around,
p330
aVit might look to you, right?
p331
aVAnd if you could see invisible matter, too.
p332
aa(lp333
VAnd so the idea is, you know, how would you put together the universe
p334
aVin a very simple way?
p335
aVWe're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe,
p336
aVeverything we can see in every direction with the Hubble Space Telescope
p337
aVplus our other instruments,
p338
aVwas once in a region that was smaller than an atom.
p339
aVIt started with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuations,
p340
aVbut expanding at a tremendous rate.
p341
aVAnd those fluctuations
p342
aVwere stretched to astronomical sizes, and those fluctuations
p343
aVeventually are the things we see in the cosmic microwave background.
p344
aVAnd then we needed some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies
p345
aVand clusters of galaxies and make these kinds of structures go on.
p346
aa(lp347
VSo I'm going to show you a smaller simulation.
p348
aVThis simulation was run on 1,000 processors for a month
p349
aVin order to make just this simple visible one.
p350
aVSo I'm going to show you one
p351
aVthat can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture.
p352
aVSo you start out with teeny fluctuations
p353
aVwhen the universe was at this point,
p354
aVnow four times smaller, and so forth.
p355
aVAnd you start seeing these networks, this cosmic web of structure forming.
p356
aVAnd this is a simple one, because it doesn't have the ordinary matter
p357
aVand it just has the dark matter in it.
p358
aVAnd you see how the dark matter lumps up,
p359
aVand the ordinary matter just trails along behind.
p360
aVSo there it is.
p361
aVAt the beginning it's very uniform.
p362
aVThe fluctuations are a part in 100,000.
p363
aVThere are a few peaks that are a part in 10,000,
p364
aVand then over billions of years, gravity just pulls in.
p365
aa(lp366
VThis is light over density, pulls the material around in.
p367
aVThat pulls in more material and pulls in more material.
p368
aVBut the distances on the universe are so large
p369
aVand the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form.
p370
aVAnd it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size it is now,
p371
aVin terms of its expansion.
p372
aVAnd at that point, the universe mysteriously starts accelerating
p373
aVits expansion and cuts off the formation of larger-scale structure.
p374
aVSo we're just seeing as large a scale structure as we can see,
p375
aVand then only things that have started forming already
p376
aVare going to form, and then from then on it's going to go on.
p377
aa(lp378
VSo we're able to do the simulation, but this is two days on a desktop.
p379
aVWe need, you know, 30 days on 1,000 processors
p380
aVto do the kind of simulation that I showed you before.
p381
aVSo we have an idea of how to play seriously, creating the universe
p382
aVby starting with essentially less than an eyedrop full of material,
p383
aVand we create everything we can see in any direction, right,
p384
aVfrom almost nothing \u2014 that is, something extremely tiny,
p385
aVextremely small \u2014 and it is almost perfect,
p386
aVexcept it has these tiny fluctuations at a part in 100,000 level,
p387
aVwhich turn out to produce the interesting patterns and designs we see,
p388
aVthat is, galaxies and stars and so forth.
p389
aa(lp390
VSo we have a model, and we can calculate it, and we can use it
p391
aVto make designs of what we think the universe really looks like.
p392
aVAnd that design is sort of way beyond
p393
aVwhat our original imagination ever was.
p394
aVSo this is what we started with 15 years ago,
p395
aVwith the Cosmic Background Explorer \u2014 made the map on the upper right,
p396
aVwhich basically showed us that there were large-scale fluctuations,
p397
aVand actually fluctuations on several scales. You can kind of see that.
p398
aVSince then we've had WMAP,
p399
aVwhich just gives us higher angular resolution.
p400
aVWe see the same large-scale structure,
p401
aVbut we see additional small-scale structure.
p402
aVAnd on the bottom right is if the satellite had flipped upside down
p403
aVand mapped the Earth, what kind of a map we would have got of the Earth.
p404
aVYou can see, well, you can, kind of pick out
p405
aVall the major continents, but that's about it.
p406
aa(lp407
VBut what we're hoping when we get to Planck, we'll have resolution
p408
aVabout equivalent to the resolution you see of the Earth there,
p409
aVwhere you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the Earth.
p410
aVAnd you can also tell, because of the sharp edges
p411
aVand the way things fit together, there are some non-linear processes.
p412
aVGeology has these effects,
p413
aVwhich is moving the plates around and so forth.
p414
aVYou can see that just from the map alone.
p415
aVWe want to get to the point in our maps of the early universe
p416
aVwe can see whether there are any non-linear effects
p417
aVthat are starting to move, to modify, and are giving us a hint about how
p418
aVspace-time itself was actually created at the beginning moments.
p419
aVSo that's where we are today,
p420
aVand that's what I wanted to give you  a flavor of.
p421
aVGive you a different view about what the design
p422
aVand what everything else looks like.
p423
aVThank you.

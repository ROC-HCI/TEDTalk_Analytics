VCan I ask you to please recall a time
p5
aVwhen you really loved something \u2014
p6
aVa movie, an album, a song or a book \u2014
p7
aVand you recommended it wholeheartedly
p8
aVto someone you also really liked,
p9
aVand you anticipated that reaction, you waited for it,
p10
aVand it came back, and the person hated it?
p11
aVSo, by way of introduction,
p12
aVthat is the exact same state
p13
aVin which I spent every working day of the last six years. (Laughter)
p14
aVI teach high school math.
p15
aVI sell a product to a market
p16
aVthat doesn't want it, but is forced by law to buy it.
p17
aVI mean, it's just a losing proposition.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo there's a useful stereotype about students that I see,
p20
aVa useful stereotype about you all.
p21
aVI could give you guys
p22
aVan algebra-two final exam,
p23
aVand I would expect no higher
p24
aVthan a 25 percent pass rate.
p25
aVAnd both of these facts say less about you or my students
p26
aVthan they do about what we call math education
p27
aVin the U.S. today.
p28
aa(lp29
VTo start with, I'd like to break math down into two categories.
p30
aVOne is computation; this is the stuff you've forgotten.
p31
aVFor example, factoring quadratics with
p32
aVleading coefficients greater than one.
p33
aVThis stuff is also really easy to relearn,
p34
aVprovided you have a really strong grounding
p35
aVin reasoning. Math reasoning \u2014
p36
aVwe'll call it the application
p37
aVof math processes to the world around us \u2014
p38
aVthis is hard to teach.
p39
aVThis is what we would love students to retain,
p40
aVeven if they don't go into mathematical fields.
p41
aVThis is also something that, the way we teach it in the U.S.
p42
aVall but ensures they won't retain it.
p43
aVSo, I'd like to talk about why that is,
p44
aVwhy that's such a calamity for society, what we can do about it
p45
aVand, to close with, why this is an amazing time
p46
aVto be a math teacher.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo first, five symptoms
p49
aVthat you're doing math reasoning wrong
p50
aVin your classroom.
p51
aVOne is a lack of initiative; your students don't self-start.
p52
aVYou finish your lecture block
p53
aVand immediately you have five hands going up
p54
aVasking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks.
p55
aVStudents lack perseverance.
p56
aVThey lack retention; you find yourself
p57
aVre-explaining concepts three months later, wholesale.
p58
aVThere's an aversion to word problems,
p59
aVwhich describes 99 percent of my students.
p60
aVAnd then the other one percent
p61
aVis eagerly looking for the formula
p62
aVto apply in that situation.
p63
aVThis is really destructive.
p64
aa(lp65
VDavid Milch, creator of "Deadwood" and other amazing TV shows,
p66
aVhas a really good description for this.
p67
aVHe swore off creating
p68
aVcontemporary drama,
p69
aVshows set in the present day,
p70
aVbecause he saw that when people fill their mind
p71
aVwith four hours a day of, for example, "Two and a Half Men," no disrespect,
p72
aVit shapes the neural pathways, he said,
p73
aVin such a way that they expect simple problems.
p74
aVHe called it, "an impatience with irresolution."
p75
aVYou're impatient with things that don't resolve quickly.
p76
aVYou expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes,
p77
aVthree commercial breaks and a laugh track.
p78
aVAnd I'll put it to all of you,
p79
aVwhat you already know, that no problem worth solving is that simple.
p80
aVI am very concerned about this
p81
aVbecause I'm going to retire in a world that my students will run.
p82
aVI'm doing bad things
p83
aVto my own future and well-being
p84
aVwhen I teach this way.
p85
aVI'm here to tell you that the way our textbooks \u2014 particularly
p86
aVmass-adopted textbooks \u2014 teach math reasoning
p87
aVand patient problem solving,
p88
aVit's functionally equivalent to turning on "Two and a Half Men" and calling it a day.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VIn all seriousness. Here's an example from a physics textbook.
p93
aVIt applies equally to math.
p94
aVNotice, first of all here,
p95
aVthat you have exactly three pieces of information there,
p96
aVeach of which will figure into a formula
p97
aVsomewhere, eventually,
p98
aVwhich the student will then compute.
p99
aVI believe in real life.
p100
aVAnd ask yourself, what problem have you solved, ever,
p101
aVthat was worth solving
p102
aVwhere you knew all of the given information in advance;
p103
aVwhere you didn't have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out,
p104
aVor you didn't have sufficient information
p105
aVand had to go find some.
p106
aVI'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that.
p107
aVAnd the textbook, I think, knows how it's hamstringing students
p108
aVbecause, watch this, this is the practice problem set.
p109
aVWhen it comes time to do the actual problem set,
p110
aVwe have problems like this right here
p111
aVwhere we're just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit.
p112
aVAnd if the student still doesn't recognize the stamp this was molded from,
p113
aVit helpfully explains to you
p114
aVwhat sample problem you can return to to find the formula.
p115
aVYou could literally, I mean this,
p116
aVpass this particular unit without knowing any physics,
p117
aVjust knowing how to decode a textbook. That's a shame.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math.
p120
aVHere's a really cool problem. I like this.
p121
aVIt's about defining steepness and slope
p122
aVusing a ski lift.
p123
aVBut what you have here is actually four separate layers,
p124
aVand I'm curious which of you can see the four separate layers
p125
aVand, particularly, how when they're compressed together
p126
aVand presented to the student all at once,
p127
aVhow that creates this impatient problem solving.
p128
aVI'll define them here: You have the visual.
p129
aVYou also have the mathematical structure,
p130
aVtalking about grids, measurements, labels,
p131
aVpoints, axes, that sort of thing.
p132
aVYou have substeps, which all lead to what we really want to talk about:
p133
aVwhich section is the steepest.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo I hope you can see.
p136
aVI really hope you can see how what we're doing here
p137
aVis taking a compelling question, a compelling answer,
p138
aVbut we're paving a smooth, straight path
p139
aVfrom one to the other
p140
aVand congratulating our students for how well
p141
aVthey can step over the small cracks in the way.
p142
aVThat's all we're doing here.
p143
aVSo I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way
p144
aVand build them up with students,
p145
aVwe can have everything we're looking for in terms of patient problem solving.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo right here I start with the visual,
p148
aVand I immediately ask the question:
p149
aVWhich section is the steepest?
p150
aVAnd this starts conversation
p151
aVbecause the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers.
p152
aVSo you get people arguing against each other,
p153
aVfriend versus friend,
p154
aVin pairs, journaling, whatever.
p155
aVAnd then eventually we realize
p156
aVit's getting annoying to talk about
p157
aVthe skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen
p158
aVor the skier just above the mid line.
p159
aVAnd we realize how great would it be
p160
aVif we just had some A, B, C and D labels
p161
aVto talk about them more easily.
p162
aVAnd then as we start to define what does steepness mean,
p163
aVwe realize it would be nice to have some measurements
p164
aVto really narrow it down, specifically what that means.
p165
aVAnd then and only then,
p166
aVwe throw down that mathematical structure.
p167
aVThe math serves the conversation,
p168
aVthe conversation doesn't serve the math.
p169
aVAnd at that point, I'll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes
p170
aVare good to go on the whole slope, steepness thing.
p171
aVBut if you need to,
p172
aVyour students can then develop those substeps together.
p173
aa(lp174
VDo you guys see how this, right here, compared to that \u2014
p175
aVwhich one creates that patient problem solving, that math reasoning?
p176
aVIt's been obvious in my practice, to me.
p177
aVAnd I'll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein,
p178
aVwho, I believe, has paid his dues.
p179
aVHe talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important,
p180
aVand yet in my practice, in the U.S. here,
p181
aVwe just give problems to students;
p182
aVwe don't involve them in the formulation of the problem.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo 90 percent of what I do
p185
aVwith my five hours of prep time per week
p186
aVis to take fairly compelling elements
p187
aVof problems like this from my textbook
p188
aVand rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving.
p189
aVAnd here's how it works.
p190
aVI like this question. It's about a water tank.
p191
aVThe question is: How long will it take you to fill it up?
p192
aVFirst things first, we eliminate all the substeps.
p193
aVStudents have to develop those,
p194
aVthey have to formulate those.
p195
aVAnd then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you'll need.
p196
aVNone of it's a distractor, so we lose that.
p197
aVStudents need to decide, "All right, well,
p198
aVdoes the height matter? Does the side of it matter?
p199
aVDoes the color of the valve matter? What matters here?"
p200
aVSuch an underrepresented question in math curriculum.
p201
aVSo now we have a water tank.
p202
aVHow long will it take you to fill it up? And that's it.
p203
aa(lp204
VAnd because this is the 21st century
p205
aVand we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms,
p206
aVnot in terms of line art or clip art
p207
aVthat you so often see in textbooks,
p208
aVwe go out and we take a picture of it.
p209
aVSo now we have the real deal.
p210
aVHow long will it take it to fill it up?
p211
aVAnd then even better is we take a video,
p212
aVa video of someone filling it up.
p213
aVAnd it's filling up slowly, agonizingly slowly.
p214
aVIt's tedious.
p215
aVStudents are looking at their watches, rolling their eyes,
p216
aVand they're all wondering at some point or another,
p217
aV"Man, how long is it going to take to fill up?"
p218
aV(Laughter)
p219
aVThat's how you know you've baited the hook, right?
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd that question, off this right here, is really fun for me
p222
aVbecause, like the intro,
p223
aVI teach kids \u2014 because of my inexperience \u2014
p224
aVI teach the kids that are the most remedial, all right?
p225
aVAnd I've got kids who will not join a conversation about math
p226
aVbecause someone else has the formula;
p227
aVsomeone else knows how to work the formula better than me,
p228
aVso I won't talk about it.
p229
aVBut here, every student is on a level playing field of intuition.
p230
aVEveryone's filled something up with water before,
p231
aVso I get kids answering the question, "How long will it take?"
p232
aVI've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated
p233
aVjoining the conversation.
p234
aVWe put names on the board, attach them to guesses,
p235
aVand kids have bought in here.
p236
aVAnd then we follow the process I've described.
p237
aVAnd the best part here, or one of the better parts
p238
aVis that we don't get our answer from the answer key
p239
aVin the back of the teacher's edition.
p240
aVWe, instead, just watch the end of the movie.
p241
aV(Laughter)
p242
aVAnd that's terrifying,
p243
aVbecause the theoretical models that always work out
p244
aVin the answer key in the back of a teacher's edition,
p245
aVthat's great, but
p246
aVit's scary to talk about sources of error
p247
aVwhen the theoretical does not match up with the practical.
p248
aVBut those conversations have been so valuable,
p249
aVamong the most valuable.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo I'm here to report some really fun games
p252
aVwith students who come pre-installed
p253
aVwith these viruses day one of the class.
p254
aVThese are the kids who now, one semester in,
p255
aVI can put something on the board,
p256
aVtotally new, totally foreign,
p257
aVand they'll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more
p258
aVthan they would have at the start of the year,
p259
aVwhich is just so fun.
p260
aVWe're no longer averse to word problems,
p261
aVbecause we've redefined what a word problem is.
p262
aVWe're no longer intimidated by math,
p263
aVbecause we're slowly redefining what math is.
p264
aVThis has been a lot of fun.
p265
aa(lp266
VI encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia,
p267
aVbecause it brings the real world into your classroom
p268
aVin high resolution and full color;
p269
aVto encourage student intuition for that level playing field;
p270
aVto ask the shortest question you possibly can
p271
aVand let those more specific questions come out in conversation;
p272
aVto let students build the problem,
p273
aVbecause Einstein said so;
p274
aVand to finally, in total, just be less helpful,
p275
aVbecause the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways:
p276
aVIt's buying you out of your obligation,
p277
aVfor patient problem solving and math reasoning, to be less helpful.
p278
aa(lp279
VAnd why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now
p280
aVis because we have the tools to create
p281
aVthis high-quality curriculum in our front pocket.
p282
aVIt's ubiquitous and fairly cheap,
p283
aVand the tools to distribute it
p284
aVfreely under open licenses
p285
aVhas also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous.
p286
aVI put a video series on my blog not so long ago
p287
aVand it got 6,000 views in two weeks.
p288
aVI get emails still from teachers in countries I've never visited
p289
aVsaying, "Wow, yeah. We had a good conversation about that.
p290
aVOh, and by the way, here's how I made your stuff better,"
p291
aVwhich, wow.
p292
aVI put this problem on my blog recently:
p293
aVIn a grocery store, which line do you get into,
p294
aVthe one that has one cart and 19 items
p295
aVor the line with four carts and three, five, two and one items.
p296
aVAnd the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom,
p297
aVbut it eventually got me on "Good Morning America" a few weeks later,
p298
aVwhich is just bizarre, right?
p299
aa(lp300
VAnd from all of this, I can only conclude
p301
aVthat people, not just students,
p302
aVare really hungry for this.
p303
aVMath makes sense of the world.
p304
aVMath is the vocabulary
p305
aVfor your own intuition.
p306
aVSo I just really encourage you, whatever your stake is in education \u2014
p307
aVwhether you're a student, parent, teacher, policy maker, whatever \u2014
p308
aVinsist on better math curriculum.
p309
aVWe need more patient problem solvers. Thank you. (Applause)

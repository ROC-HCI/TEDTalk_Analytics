VTime flies.
p5
aVIt's actually almost 20 years ago
p6
aVwhen I wanted to reframe the way we use information,
p7
aVthe way we work together: I invented the World Wide Web.
p8
aVNow, 20 years on, at TED,
p9
aVI want to ask your help in a new reframing.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo going back to 1989,
p12
aVI wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system.
p13
aVNobody really did anything with it, pretty much.
p14
aVBut 18 months later \u2014 this is how innovation happens \u2014
p15
aV18 months later, my boss said I could do it on the side,
p16
aVas a sort of a play project,
p17
aVkick the tires of a new computer we'd got.
p18
aVAnd so he gave me the time to code it up.
p19
aVSo I basically roughed out what HTML should look like:
p20
aVhypertext protocol, HTTP;
p21
aVthe idea of URLs, these names for things
p22
aVwhich started with HTTP.
p23
aVI wrote the code and put it out there.
p24
aa(lp25
VWhy did I do it?
p26
aVWell, it was basically frustration.
p27
aVI was frustrated \u2014 I was working as a software engineer
p28
aVin this huge, very exciting lab,
p29
aVlots of people coming from all over the world.
p30
aVThey brought all sorts of different computers with them.
p31
aVThey had all sorts of different data formats,
p32
aVall sorts, all kinds of documentation systems.
p33
aVSo that, in all that diversity,
p34
aVif I wanted to figure out how to build something
p35
aVout of a bit of this and a bit of this,
p36
aVeverything I looked into, I had to connect to some new machine,
p37
aVI had to learn to run some new program,
p38
aVI would find the information I wanted in some new data format.
p39
aVAnd these were all incompatible.
p40
aVIt was just very frustrating.
p41
aVThe frustration was all this unlocked potential.
p42
aa(lp43
VIn fact, on all these discs there were documents.
p44
aVSo if you just imagined them all
p45
aVbeing part of some big, virtual documentation system in the sky,
p46
aVsay on the Internet,
p47
aVthen life would be so much easier.
p48
aVWell, once you've had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skin
p49
aVand even if people don't read your memo \u2014
p50
aVactually he did, it was found after he died, his copy.
p51
aVHe had written, "Vague, but exciting," in pencil, in the corner.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VBut in general it was difficult \u2014 it was really difficult to explain
p56
aVwhat the web was like.
p57
aVIt's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then.
p58
aVBut then \u2014 OK, when TED started, there was no web
p59
aVso things like "click" didn't have the same meaning.
p60
aVI can show somebody a piece of hypertext,
p61
aVa page which has got links,
p62
aVand we click on the link and bing \u2014 there'll be another hypertext page.
p63
aVNot impressive.
p64
aVYou know, we've seen that \u2014 we've got things on hypertext on CD-ROMs.
p65
aVWhat was difficult was to get them to imagine:
p66
aVso, imagine that that link could have gone
p67
aVto virtually any document you could imagine.
p68
aVAlright, that is the leap that was very difficult for people to make.
p69
aVWell, some people did.
p70
aVSo yeah, it was difficult to explain, but there was a grassroots movement.
p71
aVAnd that is what has made it most fun.
p72
aVThat has been the most exciting thing,
p73
aVnot the technology, not the things people have done with it,
p74
aVbut actually the community, the spirit of all these people
p75
aVgetting together, sending the emails.
p76
aVThat's what it was like then.
p77
aa(lp78
VDo you know what? It's funny, but right now it's kind of like that again.
p79
aVI asked everybody, more or less, to put their documents \u2014
p80
aVI said, "Could you put your documents on this web thing?"
p81
aVAnd you did.
p82
aVThanks.
p83
aVIt's been a blast, hasn't it?
p84
aVI mean, it has been quite interesting
p85
aVbecause we've found out that the things that happen with the web
p86
aVreally sort of blow us away.
p87
aVThey're much more than we'd originally imagined
p88
aVwhen we put together the little, initial website
p89
aVthat we started off with.
p90
aVNow, I want you to put your data on the web.
p91
aVTurns out that there is still huge unlocked potential.
p92
aVThere is still a huge frustration
p93
aVthat people have because we haven't got data on the web as data.
p94
aa(lp95
VWhat do you mean, "data"? What's the difference \u2014 documents, data?
p96
aVWell, documents you read, OK?
p97
aVMore or less, you read them, you can follow links from them, and that's it.
p98
aVData \u2014 you can do all kinds of stuff with a computer.
p99
aVWho was here or has otherwise seen Hans Rosling's talk?
p100
aVOne of the great \u2014 yes a lot of people have seen it \u2014
p101
aVone of the great TED Talks.
p102
aVHans put up this presentation
p103
aVin which he showed, for various different countries, in various different colors \u2014
p104
aVhe showed income levels on one axis
p105
aVand he showed infant mortality, and he shot this thing animated through time.
p106
aVSo, he'd taken this data and made a presentation
p107
aVwhich just shattered a lot of myths that people had
p108
aVabout the economics in the developing world.
p109
aa(lp110
VHe put up a slide a little bit like this.
p111
aVIt had underground all the data
p112
aVOK, data is brown and boxy and boring,
p113
aVand that's how we think of it, isn't it?
p114
aVBecause data you can't naturally use by itself
p115
aVBut in fact, data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives
p116
aVand it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it.
p117
aVIn this case, Hans had put the data together
p118
aVhe had found from all kinds of United Nations websites and things.
p119
aVHe had put it together,
p120
aVcombined it into something more interesting than the original pieces
p121
aVand then he'd put it into this software,
p122
aVwhich I think his son developed, originally,
p123
aVand produces this wonderful presentation.
p124
aVAnd Hans made a point
p125
aVof saying, "Look, it's really important to have a lot of data."
p126
aVAnd I was happy to see that at the party last night
p127
aVthat he was still saying, very forcibly, "It's really important to have a lot of data."
p128
aa(lp129
VSo I want us now to think about
p130
aVnot just two pieces of data being connected, or six like he did,
p131
aVbut I want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web
p132
aVand so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web
p133
aVand then calling that linked data.
p134
aVThe technology is linked data, and it's extremely simple.
p135
aVIf you want to put something on the web there are three rules:
p136
aVfirst thing is that those HTTP names \u2014
p137
aVthose things that start with "http:" \u2014
p138
aVwe're using them not just for documents now,
p139
aVwe're using them for things that the documents are about.
p140
aVWe're using them for people, we're using them for places,
p141
aVwe're using them for your products, we're using them for events.
p142
aVAll kinds of conceptual things, they have names now that start with HTTP.
p143
aa(lp144
VSecond rule, if I take one of these HTTP names and I look it up
p145
aVand I do the web thing with it and I fetch the data
p146
aVusing the HTTP protocol from the web,
p147
aVI will get back some data in a standard format
p148
aVwhich is kind of useful data that somebody might like to know
p149
aVabout that thing, about that event.
p150
aVWho's at the event? Whatever it is about that person,
p151
aVwhere they were born, things like that.
p152
aVSo the second rule is I get important information back.
p153
aa(lp154
VThird rule is that when I get back that information
p155
aVit's not just got somebody's height and weight and when they were born,
p156
aVit's got relationships.
p157
aVData is relationships.
p158
aVInterestingly, data is relationships.
p159
aVThis person was born in Berlin; Berlin is in Germany.
p160
aVAnd when it has relationships, whenever it expresses a relationship
p161
aVthen the other thing that it's related to
p162
aVis given one of those names that starts HTTP.
p163
aVSo, I can go ahead and look that thing up.
p164
aVSo I look up a person \u2014 I can look up then the city where they were born; then
p165
aVI can look up the region it's in, and the town it's in,
p166
aVand the population of it, and so on.
p167
aVSo I can browse this stuff.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo that's it, really.
p170
aVThat is linked data.
p171
aVI wrote an article entitled "Linked Data" a couple of years ago
p172
aVand soon after that, things started to happen.
p173
aVThe idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lots
p174
aVof these boxes that Hans had,
p175
aVand we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting.
p176
aVIt's not just a whole lot of other plants.
p177
aVIt's not just a root supplying a plant,
p178
aVbut for each of those plants, whatever it is \u2014
p179
aVa presentation, an analysis, somebody's looking for patterns in the data \u2014
p180
aVthey get to look at all the data
p181
aVand they get it connected together,
p182
aVand the really important thing about data
p183
aVis the more things you have to connect together, the more powerful it is.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo, linked data.
p186
aVThe meme went out there.
p187
aVAnd, pretty soon Chris Bizer at the Freie Universitat in Berlin
p188
aVwho was one of the first people to put interesting things up,
p189
aVhe noticed that Wikipedia \u2014
p190
aVyou know Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia
p191
aVwith lots and lots of interesting documents in it.
p192
aVWell, in those documents, there are little squares, little boxes.
p193
aVAnd in most information boxes, there's data.
p194
aVSo he wrote a program to take the data, extract it from Wikipedia,
p195
aVand put it into a blob of linked data
p196
aVon the web, which he called dbpedia.
p197
aVDbpedia is represented by the blue blob in the middle of this slide
p198
aVand if you actually go and look up Berlin,
p199
aVyou'll find that there are other blobs of data
p200
aVwhich also have stuff about Berlin, and they're linked together.
p201
aVSo if you pull the data from dbpedia about Berlin,
p202
aVyou'll end up pulling up these other things as well.
p203
aVAnd the exciting thing is it's starting to grow.
p204
aVThis is just the grassroots stuff again, OK?
p205
aa(lp206
VLet's think about data for a bit.
p207
aVData comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms.
p208
aVThink of the diversity of the web. It's a really important thing
p209
aVthat the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there.
p210
aVSo it is with data. I could talk about all kinds of data.
p211
aVWe could talk about government data, enterprise data is really important,
p212
aVthere's scientific data, there's personal data,
p213
aVthere's weather data, there's data about events,
p214
aVthere's data about talks, and there's news and there's all kinds of stuff.
p215
aVI'm just going to mention a few of them
p216
aVso that you get the idea of the diversity of it,
p217
aVso that you also see how much unlocked potential.
p218
aa(lp219
VLet's start with government data.
p220
aVBarack Obama said in a speech,
p221
aVthat he \u2014 American government data would be available on the Internet
p222
aVin accessible formats.
p223
aVAnd I hope that they will put it up as linked data.
p224
aVThat's important. Why is it important?
p225
aVNot just for transparency, yeah transparency in government is important,
p226
aVbut that data \u2014 this is the data from all the government departments
p227
aVThink about how much of that data is about how life is lived in America.
p228
aVIt's actual useful. It's got value.
p229
aVI can use it in my company.
p230
aVI could use it as a kid to do my homework.
p231
aVSo we're talking about making the place, making the world run better
p232
aVby making this data available.
p233
aa(lp234
VIn fact if you're responsible \u2014 if you know about some data
p235
aVin a government department, often you find that
p236
aVthese people, they're very tempted to keep it \u2014
p237
aVHans calls it database hugging.
p238
aVYou hug your database, you don't want to let it go
p239
aVuntil you've made a beautiful website for it.
p240
aVWell, I'd like to suggest that rather \u2014
p241
aVyes, make a beautiful website,
p242
aVwho am I to say don't make a beautiful website?
p243
aVMake a beautiful website, but first
p244
aVgive us the unadulterated data,
p245
aVwe want the data.
p246
aVWe want unadulterated data.
p247
aVOK, we have to ask for raw data now.
p248
aVAnd I'm going to ask you to practice that, OK?
p249
aVCan you say "raw"?
p250
aa(lp251
VAudience: Raw.
p252
aa(lp253
VTim Berners-Lee: Can you say "data"?
p254
aa(lp255
VAudience: Data.
p256
aa(lp257
VTBL: Can you say "now"?
p258
aa(lp259
VAudience: Now!
p260
aa(lp261
VTBL: Alright, "raw data now"!
p262
aa(lp263
VAudience: Raw data now!
p264
aa(lp265
VPractice that. It's important because you have no idea the number of excuses
p266
aVpeople come up with to hang onto their data
p267
aVand not give it to you, even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer.
p268
aVAnd it's not just America. It's all over the world.
p269
aVAnd it's not just governments, of course \u2014 it's enterprises as well.
p270
aa(lp271
VSo I'm just going to mention a few other thoughts on data.
p272
aVHere we are at TED, and all the time we are very conscious
p273
aVof the huge challenges that human society has right now \u2014
p274
aVcuring cancer, understanding the brain for Alzheimer's,
p275
aVunderstanding the economy to make it a little bit more stable,
p276
aVunderstanding how the world works.
p277
aVThe people who are going to solve those \u2014 the scientists \u2014
p278
aVthey have half-formed ideas in their head,
p279
aVthey try to communicate those over the web.
p280
aVBut a lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the moment
p281
aVis on databases, often sitting in their computers,
p282
aVand actually, currently not shared.
p283
aa(lp284
VIn fact, I'll just go into one area \u2014
p285
aVif you're looking at Alzheimer's, for example,
p286
aVdrug discovery \u2014 there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out
p287
aVbecause scientists in that field realize
p288
aVthis is a great way of getting out of those silos,
p289
aVbecause they had their genomics data in one database
p290
aVin one building, and they had their protein data in another.
p291
aVNow, they are sticking it onto \u2014 linked data \u2014
p292
aVand now they can ask the sort of question, that you probably wouldn't ask,
p293
aVI wouldn't ask \u2014 they would.
p294
aVWhat proteins are involved in signal transduction
p295
aVand also related to pyramidal neurons?
p296
aVWell, you take that mouthful and you put it into Google.
p297
aVOf course, there's no page on the web which has answered that question
p298
aVbecause nobody has asked that question before.
p299
aVYou get 223,000 hits \u2014
p300
aVno results you can use.
p301
aVYou ask the linked data \u2014 which they've now put together \u2014
p302
aV32 hits, each of which is a protein which has those properties
p303
aVand you can look at.
p304
aVThe power of being able to ask those questions, as a scientist \u2014
p305
aVquestions which actually bridge across different disciplines \u2014
p306
aVis really a complete sea change.
p307
aVIt's very very important.
p308
aVScientists are totally stymied at the moment \u2014
p309
aVthe power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up
p310
aVand we need to get it unlocked so we can tackle those huge problems.
p311
aa(lp312
VNow if I go on like this, you'll think that all the data comes from huge institutions
p313
aVand has nothing to do with you.
p314
aVBut, that's not true.
p315
aVIn fact, data is about our lives.
p316
aVYou just \u2014 you log on to your social networking site,
p317
aVyour favorite one, you say, "This is my friend."
p318
aVBing! Relationship. Data.
p319
aVYou say, "This photograph, it's about \u2014 it depicts this person. "
p320
aVBing! That's data. Data, data, data.
p321
aVEvery time you do things on the social networking site,
p322
aVthe social networking site is taking data and using it \u2014 re-purposing it \u2014
p323
aVand using it to make other people's lives more interesting on the site.
p324
aVBut, when you go to another linked data site \u2014
p325
aVand let's say this is one about travel,
p326
aVand you say, "I want to send this photo to all the people in that group,"
p327
aVyou can't get over the walls.
p328
aVThe Economist wrote an article about it, and lots of people have blogged about it \u2014
p329
aVtremendous frustration.
p330
aVThe way to break down the silos is to get inter-operability
p331
aVbetween social networking sites.
p332
aVWe need to do that with linked data.
p333
aa(lp334
VOne last type of data I'll talk about, maybe it's the most exciting.
p335
aVBefore I came down here, I looked it up on OpenStreetMap
p336
aVThe OpenStreetMap's a map, but it's also a Wiki.
p337
aVZoom in and that square thing is a theater \u2014 which we're in right now \u2014
p338
aVThe Terrace Theater. It didn't have a name on it.
p339
aVSo I could go into edit mode, I could select the theater,
p340
aVI could add down at the bottom the name, and I could save it back.
p341
aVAnd now if you go back to the OpenStreetMap. org,
p342
aVand you find this place, you will find that The Terrace Theater has got a name.
p343
aVI did that. Me!
p344
aVI did that to the map. I just did that!
p345
aVI put that up on there. Hey, you know what?
p346
aVIf I \u2014 that street map is all about everybody doing their bit
p347
aVand it creates an incredible resource
p348
aVbecause everybody else does theirs.
p349
aVAnd that is what linked data is all about.
p350
aVIt's about people doing their bit
p351
aVto produce a little bit, and it all connecting.
p352
aVThat's how linked data works.
p353
aVYou do your bit. Everybody else does theirs.
p354
aVYou may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there
p355
aVbut you know to demand it.
p356
aVAnd we've practiced that.
p357
aa(lp358
VSo, linked data \u2014 it's huge.
p359
aVI've only told you a very small number of things
p360
aVThere are data in every aspect of our lives,
p361
aVevery aspect of work and pleasure,
p362
aVand it's not just about the number of places where data comes,
p363
aVit's about connecting it together.
p364
aVAnd when you connect data together, you get power
p365
aVin a way that doesn't happen just with the web, with documents.
p366
aVYou get this really huge power out of it.
p367
aVSo, we're at the stage now
p368
aVwhere we have to do this \u2014 the people who think it's a great idea.
p369
aVAnd all the people \u2014 and I think there's a lot of people at TED who do things because \u2014
p370
aVeven though there's not an immediate return on the investment
p371
aVbecause it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it \u2014
p372
aVthey'll do it because they're the sort of person who just does things
p373
aVwhich would be good if everybody else did them.
p374
aVOK, so it's called linked data.
p375
aVI want you to make it.
p376
aVI want you to demand it.
p377
aVAnd I think it's an idea worth spreading.
p378
aa(lp379
VThanks.

VWe do not invest in victims,
p5
aVwe invest in survivors.
p6
aVAnd in ways both big and small,
p7
aVthe narrative of the victim
p8
aVshapes the way we see women.
p9
aVYou can't count what you don't see.
p10
aVAnd we don't invest in what's invisible to us.
p11
aVBut this is the face
p12
aVof resilience.
p13
aa(lp14
VSix years ago,
p15
aVI started writing about women entrepreneurs
p16
aVduring and after conflict.
p17
aVI set out to write a compelling economic story,
p18
aVone that had great characters, that no one else was telling,
p19
aVand one that I thought mattered.
p20
aVAnd that turned out to be women.
p21
aa(lp22
VI had left ABC news and a career I loved at the age of 30
p23
aVfor business school,
p24
aVa path I knew almost nothing about.
p25
aVNone of the women I had grown up with in Maryland
p26
aVhad graduated from college,
p27
aVlet alone considered business school.
p28
aVBut they had hustled to feed their kids
p29
aVand pay their rent.
p30
aVAnd I saw from a young age
p31
aVthat having a decent job and earning a good living
p32
aVmade the biggest difference
p33
aVfor families who were struggling.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo if you're going to talk about jobs,
p36
aVthen you have to talk about entrepreneurs.
p37
aVAnd if you're talking about entrepreneurs
p38
aVin conflict and post-conflict settings,
p39
aVthen you must talk about women,
p40
aVbecause they are the population you have left.
p41
aVRwanda in the immediate aftermath of the genocide
p42
aVwas 77 percent female.
p43
aVI want to introduce you
p44
aVto some of those entrepreneurs I've met
p45
aVand share with you some of what they've taught me over the years.
p46
aa(lp47
VI went to Afghanistan in 2005
p48
aVto work on a Financial Times piece,
p49
aVand there I met Kamila,
p50
aVa young women who told me she had just turned down
p51
aVa job with the international community
p52
aVthat would have paid her nearly $2,000 a month \u2014
p53
aVan astronomical sum in that context.
p54
aVAnd she had turned it down, she said,
p55
aVbecause she was going to start her next business,
p56
aVan entrepreneurship consultancy
p57
aVthat would teach business skills
p58
aVto men and women all around Afghanistan.
p59
aVBusiness, she said,
p60
aVwas critical to her country's future.
p61
aVBecause long after this round of internationals left,
p62
aVbusiness would help keep her country
p63
aVpeaceful and secure.
p64
aVAnd she said business was even more important for women
p65
aVbecause earning an income earned respect
p66
aVand money was power for women.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo I was amazed.
p69
aVI mean here was a girl who had never lived in peace time
p70
aVwho somehow had come to sound like a candidate from "The Apprentice."
p71
aV(Laughter)
p72
aVSo I asked her, "How in the world do you know this much about business?
p73
aVWhy are you so passionate?"
p74
aVShe said, "Oh Gayle, this is actually my third business.
p75
aVMy first business was a dressmaking business
p76
aVI started under the Taliban.
p77
aVAnd that was actually an excellent business,
p78
aVbecause we provided jobs for women all around our neighborhood.
p79
aVAnd that's really how I became an entrepreneur."
p80
aa(lp81
VThink about this:
p82
aVHere were girls who braved danger
p83
aVto become breadwinners
p84
aVduring years in which they couldn't even be on their streets.
p85
aVAnd at a time of economic collapse
p86
aVwhen people sold baby dolls and shoe laces
p87
aVand windows and doors
p88
aVjust to survive,
p89
aVthese girls made the difference
p90
aVbetween survival and starvation
p91
aVfor so many.
p92
aVI couldn't leave the story, and I couldn't leave the topic either,
p93
aVbecause everywhere I went I met more of these women
p94
aVwho no one seemed to know about,
p95
aVor even wish to.
p96
aa(lp97
VI went on to Bosnia,
p98
aVand early on in my interviews I met with an IMF official
p99
aVwho said, "You know, Gayle,
p100
aVI don't think we actually have women in business in Bosnia,
p101
aVbut there is a lady selling cheese nearby
p102
aVon the side of the road.
p103
aVSo maybe you could interview her."
p104
aVSo I went out reporting
p105
aVand within a day I met Narcisa Kavazovic
p106
aVwho at that point was opening a new factory
p107
aVon the war's former front lines in Sarajevo.
p108
aVShe had started her business
p109
aVsquatting in an abandoned garage,
p110
aVsewing sheets and pillow cases
p111
aVshe would take to markets all around the city
p112
aVso that she could support
p113
aVthe 12 or 13 family members
p114
aVwho were counting on her for survival.
p115
aVBy the time we met, she had 20 employees,
p116
aVmost of them women,
p117
aVwho were sending their boys and their girls to school.
p118
aVAnd she was just the start.
p119
aVI met women running essential oils businesses,
p120
aVwineries
p121
aVand even the country's largest advertising agency.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo these stories together
p124
aVbecame the Herald Tribune business cover.
p125
aVAnd when this story posted,
p126
aVI ran to my computer to send it to the IMF official.
p127
aVAnd I said, "Just in case you're looking for entrepreneurs
p128
aVto feature at your next investment conference,
p129
aVhere are a couple of women."
p130
aa(lp131
V(Applause)
p132
aa(lp133
VBut think about this.
p134
aVThe IMF official is hardly the only person
p135
aVto automatically file women under micro.
p136
aVThe biases, whether intentional or otherwise,
p137
aVare pervasive,
p138
aVand so are the misleading mental images.
p139
aVIf you see the word "microfinance,"
p140
aVwhat comes to mind?
p141
aVMost people say women.
p142
aVAnd if you see the word "entrepreneur,"
p143
aVmost people think men.
p144
aVWhy is that?
p145
aVBecause we aim low and we think small
p146
aVwhen it comes to women.
p147
aa(lp148
VMicrofinance is an incredibly powerful tool
p149
aVthat leads to self-sufficiency and self-respect,
p150
aVbut we must move beyond micro-hopes
p151
aVand micro-ambitions for women,
p152
aVbecause they have so much greater hopes for themselves.
p153
aVThey want to move from micro to medium and beyond.
p154
aVAnd in many places,
p155
aVthey're there.
p156
aVIn the U.S., women-owned businesses
p157
aVwill create five and a half million new jobs by 2018.
p158
aVIn South Korea and Indonesia,
p159
aVwomen own nearly half a million firms.
p160
aVChina, women run 20 percent
p161
aVof all small businesses.
p162
aVAnd in the developing world overall,
p163
aVThat figure is 40 to 50 percent.
p164
aa(lp165
VNearly everywhere I go,
p166
aVI meet incredibly interesting entrepreneurs
p167
aVwho are seeking access to finance, access to markets
p168
aVand established business networks.
p169
aVThey are often ignored
p170
aVbecause they're harder to help.
p171
aVIt is much riskier to give a 50,000 dollar loan
p172
aVthan it is to give a 500 dollar loan.
p173
aVAnd as the World Bank recently noted,
p174
aVwomen are stuck in a productivity trap.
p175
aVThose in small businesses
p176
aVcan't get the capital they need to expand
p177
aVand those in microbusiness
p178
aVcan't grow out of them.
p179
aa(lp180
VRecently I was at the State Department in Washington
p181
aVand I met an incredibly passionate entrepreneur from Ghana.
p182
aVShe sells chocolates.
p183
aVAnd she had come to Washington,
p184
aVnot seeking a handout and not seeking a microloan.
p185
aVShe had come seeking serious investment dollars
p186
aVso that she could build the factory
p187
aVand buy the equipment she needs
p188
aVto export her chocolates
p189
aVto Africa, Europe, the Middle East
p190
aVand far beyond \u2014
p191
aVcapital that would help her to employ
p192
aVmore than the 20 people
p193
aVthat she already has working for her,
p194
aVand capital that would fuel her own country's
p195
aVeconomic climb.
p196
aa(lp197
VThe great news is
p198
aVwe already know what works.
p199
aVTheory and empirical evidence
p200
aVHave already taught us.
p201
aVWe don't need to invent solutions because we have them \u2014
p202
aVcash flow loans
p203
aVbased in income rather than assets,
p204
aVloans that use secure contracts rather than collateral,
p205
aVbecause women often don't own land.
p206
aVAnd Kiva.org, the microlender,
p207
aVis actually now experimenting with crowdsourcing
p208
aVsmall and medium sized loans.
p209
aVAnd that's just to start.
p210
aa(lp211
VRecently it has become very much in fashion
p212
aVto call women "the emerging market of the emerging market."
p213
aVI think that is terrific.
p214
aVYou know why?
p215
aVBecause \u2014 and I say this as somebody who worked in finance \u2014
p216
aV500 billion dollars at least
p217
aVhas gone into the emerging markets in the past decade.
p218
aVBecause investors saw the potential for return
p219
aVat a time of slowing economic growth,
p220
aVand so they created financial products
p221
aVand financial innovation
p222
aVtailored to the emerging markets.
p223
aa(lp224
VHow wonderful would it be
p225
aVif we were prepared to replace all of our lofty words
p226
aVwith our wallets
p227
aVand invest 500 billion dollars
p228
aVunleashing women's economic potential?
p229
aVJust think of the benefits
p230
aVwhen it comes to jobs, productivity,
p231
aVemployment, child nutrition,
p232
aVmaternal mortality, literacy
p233
aVand much, much more.
p234
aVBecause, as the World Economic Forum noted,
p235
aVsmaller gender gaps are directly correlated
p236
aVwith increased economic competitiveness.
p237
aVAnd not one country in all the world
p238
aVhas eliminated its economic participation gap \u2014
p239
aVnot one.
p240
aa(lp241
VSo the great news
p242
aVis this is an incredible opportunity.
p243
aVWe have so much room to grow.
p244
aVSo you see,
p245
aVthis is not about doing good,
p246
aVthis is about global growth
p247
aVand global employment.
p248
aVIt is about how we invest
p249
aVand it's about how we see women.
p250
aVAnd women can no longer be
p251
aVboth half the population
p252
aVand a special interest group.
p253
aa(lp254
V(Applause)
p255
aa(lp256
VOftentimes I get into very interesting discussions with reporters
p257
aVwho say to me, "Gayle, these are great stories,
p258
aVbut you're really writing about the exceptions."
p259
aVNow that makes me pause for just a couple reasons.
p260
aVFirst of all, for exceptions,
p261
aVthere are a lot of them
p262
aVand they're important.
p263
aVSecondly, when we talk about men who are succeeding,
p264
aVwe rightly consider them
p265
aVicons or pioneers or innovators
p266
aVto be emulated.
p267
aVAnd when we talk about women,
p268
aVthey are either exceptions to be dismissed
p269
aVor aberrations to be ignored.
p270
aVAnd finally,
p271
aVthere is no society anywhere in all the world
p272
aVthat is not changed
p273
aVexcept by its most exceptional.
p274
aVSo why wouldn't we celebrate and elevate
p275
aVthese change makers and job creators
p276
aVrather than overlook them?
p277
aa(lp278
VThis topic of resilience is very personal to me
p279
aVand in many ways has shaped my life.
p280
aVMy mom was a single mom
p281
aVwho worked at the phone company during the day
p282
aVand sold Tupperware at night
p283
aVso that I could have every opportunity possible.
p284
aVWe shopped double coupons
p285
aVand layaway and consignment stores,
p286
aVand when she got sick with stage four breast cancer
p287
aVand could no longer work,
p288
aVwe even applied for food stamps.
p289
aVAnd when I would feel sorry for myself
p290
aVas nine or 10 year-old girls do,
p291
aVshe would say to me, "My dear, on a scale of major world tragedies,
p292
aVyours is not a three."
p293
aa(lp294
V(Laughter)
p295
aa(lp296
VAnd when I was applying to business school
p297
aVand felt certain I couldn't do it
p298
aVand nobody I knew had done it,
p299
aVI went to my aunt who survived years of beatings at the hand of her husband
p300
aVand escaped a marriage of abuse
p301
aVwith only her dignity intact.
p302
aVAnd she told me,
p303
aV"Never import other people's limitations."
p304
aa(lp305
VAnd when I complained to my grandmother,
p306
aVa World War II veteran
p307
aVwho worked in film for 50 years
p308
aVand who supported me from the age of 13,
p309
aVthat I was terrified
p310
aVthat if I turned down a plum assignment at ABC
p311
aVfor a fellowship overseas,
p312
aVI would never ever, ever find another job,
p313
aVshe said, "Kiddo, I'm going to tell you two things.
p314
aVFirst of all, no one turns down a Fulbright,
p315
aVand secondly, McDonald's is always hiring."
p316
aV(Laughter)
p317
aV"You will find a job. Take the leap."
p318
aa(lp319
VThe women in my family
p320
aVare not exceptions.
p321
aVThe women in this room and watching in L.A.
p322
aVand all around the world
p323
aVare not exceptions.
p324
aVWe are not a special interest group.
p325
aVWe are the majority.
p326
aVAnd for far too long,
p327
aVwe have underestimated ourselves
p328
aVand been undervalued by others.
p329
aVIt is time for us to aim higher
p330
aVwhen it comes to women,
p331
aVto invest more and to deploy our dollars
p332
aVto benefit women all around the world.
p333
aa(lp334
VWe can make a difference,
p335
aVand make a difference, not just for women,
p336
aVbut for a global economy
p337
aVthat desperately needs their contributions.
p338
aVTogether we can make certain
p339
aVthat the so-called exceptions
p340
aVbegin to rule.
p341
aVWhen we change the way we see ourselves,
p342
aVothers will follow.
p343
aVAnd it is time for all of us
p344
aVto think bigger.
p345
aa(lp346
VThank you very much.

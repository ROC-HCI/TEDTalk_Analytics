VThe public debate about architecture
p5
aVquite often just stays on contemplating the final result,
p6
aVthe architectural object.
p7
aVIs the latest tower in London
p8
aVa gherkin or a sausage
p9
aVor a sex tool?
p10
aa(lp11
VSo recently, we asked ourselves
p12
aVif we could invent a format
p13
aVthat could actually tell the stories behind the projects,
p14
aVmaybe combining images and drawings and words
p15
aVto actually sort of tell stories about architecture.
p16
aVAnd we discovered that we didn't have to invent it,
p17
aVit already existed in the form of a comic book.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo we basically copied the format of the comic book
p20
aVto actually tell the stories of behind the scenes,
p21
aVhow our projects actually evolve through adaptation
p22
aVand improvisation.
p23
aVSort of through the turmoil and the opportunities
p24
aVand the incidents of the real world.
p25
aVWe call this comic book "Yes is More,"
p26
aVwhich is obviously a sort of evolution of the ideas of some of our heroes.
p27
aa(lp28
VIn this case it's Mies van der Rohe's Less is More.
p29
aVHe triggered the modernist revolution.
p30
aVAfter him followed the post-modern counter-revolution,
p31
aVRobert Venturi saying, "Less is a bore."
p32
aVAfter him, Philip Johnson sort of introduced
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVyou could say promiscuity, or at least openness
p35
aVto new ideas with, "I am a whore."
p36
aVRecently, Obama has introduced optimism
p37
aVat a sort of time of global financial crisis.
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd what we'd like to say with "Yes is More"
p40
aVis basically trying to question this idea
p41
aVthat the architectural avant-garde is almost always negatively defined,
p42
aVas who or what we are against.
p43
aVThe cliche of the radical architect
p44
aVis the sort of angry young man rebelling against the establishment.
p45
aVOr this idea of the misunderstood genius,
p46
aVfrustrated that the world doesn't fit in with his or her ideas.
p47
aVRather than revolution, we're much more interested in evolution,
p48
aVthis idea that things gradually evolve
p49
aVby adapting and improvising
p50
aVto the changes of the world.
p51
aa(lp52
VIn fact, I actually think that Darwin is one of the people
p53
aVwho best explains our design process.
p54
aVHis famous evolutionary tree
p55
aVcould almost be a diagram of the way we work.
p56
aVAs you can see, a project evolves through
p57
aVa series of generations of design meetings.
p58
aVAt each meeting, there's way too many ideas.
p59
aVOnly the best ones can survive.
p60
aVAnd through a process of architectural selection,
p61
aVwe might choose a really beautiful model
p62
aVor we might have a very functional model.
p63
aVWe mate them. They have sort of mutant offspring.
p64
aVAnd through these sort of generations of design meetings
p65
aVwe arrive at a design.
p66
aa(lp67
VA very literal way of showing it is a project we did
p68
aVfor a library and a hotel in Copenhagen.
p69
aVThe design process was really tough,
p70
aValmost like a struggle for survival,
p71
aVbut gradually an idea evolved:
p72
aVthis sort of idea of a rational tower
p73
aVthat melts together with the surrounding city,
p74
aVsort of expanding the public space onto what we refer to as
p75
aVa Scandinavian version of the Spanish Steps in Rome,
p76
aVbut sort of public on the outside, as well as on the inside,
p77
aVwith the library.
p78
aa(lp79
VBut Darwin doesn't only explain the evolution of a single idea.
p80
aVAs you can see, sometimes a subspecies branches off.
p81
aVAnd quite often we sit in a design meeting
p82
aVand we discover that there is this great idea.
p83
aVIt doesn't really work in this context.
p84
aVBut for another client in another culture,
p85
aVit could really be the right answer to a different question.
p86
aVSo as a result, we never throw anything out.
p87
aVWe keep our office almost like an archive
p88
aVof architectural biodiversity.
p89
aVYou never know when you might need it.
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd what I'd like to do now, in an act of
p92
aVwarp-speed storytelling,
p93
aVis tell the story of how two projects evolved
p94
aVby adapting and improvising
p95
aVto the happenstance of the world.
p96
aVThe first story starts last year when we went to Shanghai
p97
aVto do the competition for the Danish
p98
aVNational Pavilion for the World Expo in 2010.
p99
aVAnd we saw this guy, Haibao.
p100
aVHe's the mascot of the expo,
p101
aVand he looks strangely familiar.
p102
aVIn fact he looked like a building we had designed
p103
aVfor a hotel in the north of Sweden.
p104
aVWhen we submitted it for the Swedish competition we thought
p105
aVit was a really cool scheme, but it didn't exactly
p106
aVlook like something from the north of Sweden.
p107
aVThe Swedish jury didn't think so either. So we lost.
p108
aa(lp109
VBut then we had a meeting with a Chinese businessman
p110
aVwho saw our design and said,
p111
aV"Wow, that's the Chinese character for the word 'people.'"
p112
aV(Laughter)
p113
aVSo, apparently this is how you write "people,"
p114
aVas in the People's Republic of China.
p115
aVWe even double checked.
p116
aVAnd at the same time, we got invited to exhibit
p117
aVat the Shanghai Creative Industry Week.
p118
aVSo we thought like, this is too much of an opportunity,
p119
aVso we hired a feng shui master.
p120
aVWe scaled the building up three times to Chinese proportions,
p121
aVand went to China.
p122
aV(Laughter)
p123
aVSo the People's Building, as we called it.
p124
aVThis is our two interpreters, sort of reading the architecture.
p125
aa(lp126
VIt went on the cover of the Wen Wei Po newspaper,
p127
aVwhich got Mr. Liangyu Chen, the mayor of Shanghai,
p128
aVto visit the exhibition.
p129
aVAnd we had the chance to explain the project.
p130
aVAnd he said, "Shanghai is the city in the world
p131
aVwith most skyscrapers,"
p132
aVbut to him it was as if the connection to the roots had been cut over.
p133
aVAnd with the People's Building, he saw an architecture
p134
aVthat could bridge the gap between the ancient wisdom of China
p135
aVand the progressive future of China.
p136
aVSo we obviously profoundly agreed with him.
p137
aV(Laughter)
p138
aV(Applause)
p139
aVUnfortunately, Mr. Chen is now in prison for corruption.
p140
aV(Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
VBut like I said, Haibao looked very familiar,
p143
aVbecause he is actually the Chinese character for "people."
p144
aVAnd they chose this mascot because
p145
aVthe theme of the expo is "Better City, Better Life."
p146
aVSustainability.
p147
aVAnd we thought, sustainability has grown into being
p148
aVthis sort of neo-Protestant idea
p149
aVthat it has to hurt in order to do good.
p150
aa(lp151
VYou know, you're not supposed to take long, warm showers.
p152
aVYou're not supposed to fly on holidays because it's bad for the environment.
p153
aVGradually, you get this idea that sustainable life
p154
aVis less fun than normal life.
p155
aVSo we thought that maybe it could be interesting to focus on examples
p156
aVwhere a sustainable city
p157
aVactually increases the quality of life.
p158
aa(lp159
VWe also asked ourselves, what could Denmark possibly show China
p160
aVthat would be relevant?
p161
aVYou know, it's one of the biggest countries in the world, one of the smallest.
p162
aVChina symbolized by the dragon.
p163
aVDenmark, we have a national bird, the swan.
p164
aV(Laughter)
p165
aVChina has many great poets,
p166
aa(lp167
Vbut we discovered that in the People's Republic
p168
aVpublic school curriculum,
p169
aVthey have three fairy tales by An Tu Sheng,
p170
aVor Hans Christian Anderson, as we call him.
p171
aVSo that means that all 1.3 billion Chinese
p172
aVhave grown up with "The Emperor's New Clothes,"
p173
aV"The Matchstick Girl" and "The Little Mermaid."
p174
aVIt's almost like a fragment of Danish culture
p175
aVintegrated into Chinese culture.
p176
aa(lp177
VThe biggest tourist attraction in China is the Great Wall.
p178
aVThe Great Wall is the only thing that can be seen from the moon.
p179
aVThe big tourist attraction in Denmark is The Little Mermaid.
p180
aVThat can actually hardly be seen from the canal tours.
p181
aV(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd it sort of shows the difference between these two cities.
p184
aVCopenhagen, Shanghai,
p185
aVmodern, European.
p186
aVBut then we looked at recent urban development,
p187
aVand we noticed that this is like a Shanghai street,
p188
aV30 years ago. All bikes, no cars.
p189
aVThis is how it looks today; all traffic jam.
p190
aVBicycles have become forbidden many places.
p191
aa(lp192
VMeanwhile, in Copenhagen we're actually expanding the bicycle lanes.
p193
aVA third of all the people commute by bike.
p194
aVWe have a free system of bicycles called the City Bike
p195
aVthat you can borrow if you visit the city.
p196
aVSo we thought, why don't we reintroduce the bicycle in China?
p197
aVWe donate 1,000 bikes to Shanghai.
p198
aVSo if you come to the expo, go straight to the Danish pavilion,
p199
aVget a Danish bike, and then continue on that to visit the other pavilions.
p200
aa(lp201
VLike I said, Shanghai and Copenhagen are both port cities,
p202
aVbut in Copenhagen the water has gotten so clean
p203
aVthat you can actually swim in it.
p204
aVOne of the first projects we ever did
p205
aVwas the harbor bath in Copenhagen,
p206
aVsort of continuing the public realm into the water.
p207
aVSo we thought that these expos quite often have a lot of
p208
aVstate financed propaganda,
p209
aVimages, statements, but no real experience.
p210
aVSo just like with a bike, we don't talk about it.
p211
aVYou can try it.
p212
aVLike with the water, instead of talking about it,
p213
aVwe're going to sail a million liters of harbor water
p214
aVfrom Copenhagen to Shanghai,
p215
aVso the Chinese who have the courage can actually dive in
p216
aVand feel how clean it is.
p217
aa(lp218
VThis is where people normally object that it doesn't sound very sustainable
p219
aVto sail water from Copenhagen to China.
p220
aVBut in fact, the container ships go
p221
aVfull of goods from China to Denmark,
p222
aVand then they sail empty back.
p223
aVSo quite often you load water for ballast.
p224
aVSo we can actually hitch a ride for free.
p225
aa(lp226
VAnd in the middle of this sort of harbor bath,
p227
aVwe're actually going to put the actual Little Mermaid.
p228
aVSo the real Mermaid, the real water, and the real bikes.
p229
aVAnd when she's gone, we're going to invite
p230
aVa Chinese artist to reinterpret her.
p231
aVThe architecture of the pavilion is this sort of loop
p232
aVof exhibition and bikes.
p233
aVWhen you go to the exhibition, you'll see the Mermaid and the pool.
p234
aVYou'll walk around, start looking for a bicycle on the roof,
p235
aVjump on your ride and then continue out into the rest of the expo.
p236
aa(lp237
VSo when we actually won the competition
p238
aVwe had to do an exhibition in China explaining the project.
p239
aVAnd to our surprise we got one of our boards back
p240
aVwith corrections from the Chinese state censorship.
p241
aVThe first thing, the China map missed Taiwan.
p242
aVIt's a very serious political issue in China. We will add on.
p243
aVThe second thing, we had compared the swan to the dragon,
p244
aVand then the Chinese state said,
p245
aV"Suggest change to panda."
p246
aV(Laughter)
p247
aV(Applause)
p248
aa(lp249
VSo, when it came out in Denmark that we were actually going to
p250
aVmove our national monument,
p251
aVthe National People's Party sort of rebelled against it.
p252
aVThey tried to pass a law against moving the Mermaid.
p253
aVSo for the first time, I got invited to speak at the National Parliament.
p254
aVIt was kind of interesting because in the morning, from 9 to 11,
p255
aVthey were discussing the bailout package \u2014
p256
aVhow many billions to invest in saving the Danish economy.
p257
aVAnd then at 11 o'clock they stopped talking about these little issues.
p258
aVAnd then from 11 to 1,
p259
aVthey were debating whether or not to send the Mermaid to China.
p260
aV(Laughter)
p261
aV(Applause)
p262
aa(lp263
VBut to conclude, if you want to see the Mermaid from May to December
p264
aVnext year, don't come to Copenhagen,
p265
aVbecause she's going to be in Shanghai.
p266
aVIf you do come to Copenhagen,
p267
aVyou will probably see an installation by Ai Weiwei, the Chinese artist.
p268
aVBut if the Chinese government intervenes, it might even be a panda.
p269
aV(Laughter)
p270
aa(lp271
VSo the second story that I'd like to tell
p272
aVis, actually starts in my own house.
p273
aVThis is my apartment.
p274
aVThis is the view from my apartment,
p275
aVover the sort of landscape of triangular balconies
p276
aVthat our client called the Leonardo DiCaprio balcony.
p277
aVAnd they form this sort of vertical backyard
p278
aVwhere, on a nice summer day, you'll actually get introduced to all your neighbors
p279
aVin a vertical radius of 10 meters.
p280
aVThe house is sort of a distortion of a square block.
p281
aVTrying to zigzag it to make sure
p282
aVthat all of the apartments look at the straight views,
p283
aVinstead of into each other.
p284
aa(lp285
VUntil recently, this was the view from my apartment,
p286
aVonto this place where our client actually bought the neighbor site.
p287
aVAnd he said that he was going to do an apartment block
p288
aVnext to a parking structure.
p289
aVAnd we thought, rather than doing a traditional stack of apartments
p290
aVlooking straight into a big boring block of cars,
p291
aVwhy don't we turn all the apartments into penthouses,
p292
aVput them on a podium of cars.
p293
aa(lp294
VAnd because Copenhagen is completely flat,
p295
aVif you want to have a nice south-facing slope with a view,
p296
aVyou basically have to do it yourself.
p297
aVThen we sort of cut up the volume,
p298
aVso we wouldn't block the view from my apartment.
p299
aV(Laughter)
p300
aVAnd essentially the parking is sort of occupying the deep space
p301
aVunderneath the apartments.
p302
aa(lp303
VAnd up in the sun, you have a single layer of apartments
p304
aVthat combine all the splendors of a suburban lifestyle,
p305
aVlike a house with a garden with a sort of metropolitan view,
p306
aVand a sort of dense urban location.
p307
aVThis is our first architectural model.
p308
aVThis is an aerial photo taken last summer.
p309
aVAnd essentially, the apartments cover the parking.
p310
aVThey are accessed through this diagonal elevator.
p311
aVIt's actually a stand-up product from Switzerland,
p312
aVbecause in Switzerland they have a natural need for diagonal elevators.
p313
aV(Laughter)
p314
aa(lp315
VAnd the facade of the parking,
p316
aVwe wanted to make the parking naturally ventilated,
p317
aVso we needed to perforate it.
p318
aVAnd we discovered that by controlling the size of the holes,
p319
aVwe could actually turn the entire facade
p320
aVinto a gigantic, naturally ventilated,
p321
aVrasterized image.
p322
aVAnd since we always refer to the project as The Mountain,
p323
aVwe commissioned this Japanese Himalaya photographer
p324
aVto give us this beautiful photo of Mount Everest,
p325
aVmaking the entire building a 3,000 square meter artwork.
p326
aV(Applause)
p327
aa(lp328
VSo if you go back into the parking, into the corridors,
p329
aVit's almost like traveling into a parallel universe
p330
aVfrom cars and colors,
p331
aVinto this sort of south-facing urban oasis.
p332
aVThe wood of your apartment continues outside becoming the facades.
p333
aVIf you go even further, it turns into this green garden.
p334
aVAnd all the rainwater that drops on the Mountain
p335
aVis actually accumulated.
p336
aVAnd there is an automatic irrigation system
p337
aVthat makes sure that this sort of landscape of gardens,
p338
aVin one or two years it will sort of transform
p339
aVinto a Cambodian temple ruin,
p340
aVcompletely covered in green.
p341
aa(lp342
VSo, the Mountain is like our first built example
p343
aVof what we like to refer to as architectural alchemy.
p344
aVThis idea that you can actually create, if not gold,
p345
aVthen at least added value by mixing
p346
aVtraditional ingredients, like normal apartments
p347
aVand normal parking,
p348
aVand in this case actually offer people
p349
aVthe chance that they don't have to choose between
p350
aVa life with a garden or a life in the city.
p351
aVThey can actually have both.
p352
aa(lp353
VAs an architect, it's really hard to set the agenda.
p354
aVYou can't just say that now I'd like to do a sustainable city
p355
aVin central Asia,
p356
aVbecause that's not really how you get commissions.
p357
aVYou always have to sort of adapt and improvise
p358
aVto the opportunities and accidents that happen,
p359
aVand the sort of turmoil of the world.
p360
aa(lp361
VOne last example is that recently we,
p362
aVlike last summer, we won the competition
p363
aVto design a Nordic national bank.
p364
aVThis was the director of the bank when he was still smiling.
p365
aV(Laughter)
p366
aVIt was in the middle of the capital so we were really excited by this opportunity.
p367
aVUnfortunately, it was the national bank of Iceland.
p368
aa(lp369
VAt the same time, we actually had a visitor \u2014
p370
aVa minister from Azerbaijan came to our office.
p371
aVWe took him to see the Mountain. And he got very excited
p372
aVby this idea that you could actually make mountains
p373
aVout of architecture,
p374
aVbecause Azerbaijan is known as the Alps of Central Asia.
p375
aVSo he asked us if we could actually imagine
p376
aVan urban master plan
p377
aVon an island outside the capital
p378
aVthat would recreate the silhouette of the seven most significant mountains
p379
aVof Azerbaijan.
p380
aa(lp381
VSo we took the commission.
p382
aVAnd we made this small movie that I'd like to show.
p383
aVWe quite often make little movies.
p384
aVWe always argue a lot about the soundtrack,
p385
aVbut in this case it was really easy to choose the song.
p386
aVSo basically, Baku is this sort of crescent bay
p387
aVoverlooking the island of Zira, the island that we are planning \u2014
p388
aValmost like the diagram of their flag.
p389
aVAnd our main idea was
p390
aVto sort of sample the seven most significant mountains
p391
aVof the topography of Azerbaijan
p392
aVand reinterpret them into urban and architectural structures,
p393
aVinhabitable of human life.
p394
aVThen we place these mountains on the island,
p395
aVsurrounding this sort of central green valley,
p396
aValmost like a central park.
p397
aa(lp398
VAnd what makes it interesting is that the island right now
p399
aVis just a piece of desert. It has no vegetation.
p400
aVIt has no water. It has no energy, no resources.
p401
aVSo we actually sort of designed the entire island as a single ecosystem,
p402
aVexploiting wind energy to drive the desalination plants,
p403
aVand to use the thermal properties of water
p404
aVto heat and cool the buildings.
p405
aVAnd all the sort of excess freshwater wastewater
p406
aVis filtered organically into the landscape,
p407
aVgradually transforming the desert island
p408
aVinto sort of a green, lush landscape.
p409
aa(lp410
VSo, you can say where an urban development
p411
aVnormally happens at the expense of nature,
p412
aVin this case it's actually creating nature.
p413
aVAnd the buildings, they don't only sort of
p414
aVinvoke the imagery of the mountains,
p415
aVthey also operate like mountains.
p416
aVThey create shelter from the wind.
p417
aVThey accumulate the solar energy.
p418
aVThey accumulate the water.
p419
aVSo they actually transform the entire island
p420
aVinto a single ecosystem.
p421
aa(lp422
VSo we recently presented the master plan,
p423
aVand it has gotten approved.
p424
aVAnd this summer we are starting the construction documents
p425
aVof the two first mountains,
p426
aVin what's going to be the first carbon-neutral island
p427
aVin Central Asia.
p428
aV(Applause)
p429
aVYes, maybe just to round off.
p430
aVSo in a way you can see how the Mountain in Copenhagen
p431
aVsort of evolved into the Seven Peaks of Azerbaijan.
p432
aVWith a little luck and some more evolution,
p433
aVmaybe in 10 years it could be the Five Mountains on Mars.
p434
aVThank you.
p435
aV(Applause)

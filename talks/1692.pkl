VI have a friend in Portugal
p5
aVwhose grandfather built a vehicle out of a bicycle
p6
aVand a washing machine so he could transport his family.
p7
aVHe did it because he couldn't afford a car,
p8
aVbut also because he knew how to build one.
p9
aVThere was a time when we understood how things worked
p10
aVand how they were made, so we could build and repair them,
p11
aVor at the very least
p12
aVmake informed decisions about what to buy.
p13
aVMany of these do-it-yourself practices
p14
aVwere lost in the second half of the 20th century.
p15
aVBut now, the maker community and the open-source model
p16
aVare bringing this kind of knowledge about how things work
p17
aVand what they're made of back into our lives,
p18
aVand I believe we need to take them to the next level,
p19
aVto the components things are made of.
p20
aa(lp21
VFor the most part, we still know
p22
aVwhat traditional materials like paper and textiles are made of
p23
aVand how they are produced.
p24
aVBut now we have these amazing, futuristic composites \u2014
p25
aVplastics that change shape,
p26
aVpaints that conduct electricity,
p27
aVpigments that change color, fabrics that light up.
p28
aVLet me show you some examples.
p29
aa(lp30
VSo conductive ink allows us to paint circuits
p31
aVinstead of using the traditional
p32
aVprinted circuit boards or wires.
p33
aVIn the case of this little example I'm holding,
p34
aVwe used it to create a touch sensor that reacts to my skin
p35
aVby turning on this little light.
p36
aVConductive ink has been used by artists,
p37
aVbut recent developments indicate that we will soon be able
p38
aVto use it in laser printers and pens.
p39
aVAnd this is a sheet of acrylic infused
p40
aVwith colorless light-diffusing particles.
p41
aVWhat this means is that, while regular acrylic
p42
aVonly diffuses light around the edges,
p43
aVthis one illuminates across the entire surface
p44
aVwhen I turn on the lights around it.
p45
aVTwo of the known applications for this material
p46
aVinclude interior design and multi-touch systems.
p47
aVAnd thermochromic pigments
p48
aVchange color at a given temperature.
p49
aVSo I'm going to place this on a hot plate
p50
aVthat is set to a temperature only slightly higher than ambient
p51
aVand you can see what happens.
p52
aVSo one of the principle applications for this material
p53
aVis, amongst other things, in baby bottles,
p54
aVso it indicates when the contents are cool enough to drink.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo these are just a few of what are commonly known
p57
aVas smart materials.
p58
aVIn a few years, they will be in many of the objects
p59
aVand technologies we use on a daily basis.
p60
aVWe may not yet have the flying cars science fiction promised us,
p61
aVbut we can have walls that change color
p62
aVdepending on temperature,
p63
aVkeyboards that roll up,
p64
aVand windows that become opaque at the flick of a switch.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo I'm a social scientist by training,
p67
aVso why am I here today talking about smart materials?
p68
aVWell first of all, because I am a maker.
p69
aVI'm curious about how things work
p70
aVand how they are made,
p71
aVbut also because I believe we should have a deeper understanding
p72
aVof the components that make up our world,
p73
aVand right now, we don't know enough about
p74
aVthese high-tech composites our future will be made of.
p75
aVSmart materials are hard to obtain in small quantities.
p76
aVThere's barely any information available on how to use them,
p77
aVand very little is said about how they are produced.
p78
aVSo for now, they exist mostly in this realm
p79
aVof trade secrets and patents
p80
aVonly universities and corporations have access to.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo a little over three years ago, Kirsty Boyle and I
p83
aVstarted a project we called Open Materials.
p84
aVIt's a website where we,
p85
aVand anyone else who wants to join us,
p86
aVshare experiments, publish information,
p87
aVencourage others to contribute whenever they can,
p88
aVand aggregate resources such as research papers
p89
aVand tutorials by other makers like ourselves.
p90
aVWe would like it to become a large,
p91
aVcollectively generated database
p92
aVof do-it-yourself information on smart materials.
p93
aa(lp94
VBut why should we care
p95
aVhow smart materials work and what they are made of?
p96
aVFirst of all, because we can't shape what we don't understand,
p97
aVand what we don't understand and use
p98
aVends up shaping us.
p99
aVThe objects we use, the clothes we wear,
p100
aVthe houses we live in, all have a profound impact
p101
aVon our behavior, health and quality of life.
p102
aVSo if we are to live in a world made of smart materials,
p103
aVwe should know and understand them.
p104
aVSecondly, and just as important,
p105
aVinnovation has always been fueled by tinkerers.
p106
aVSo many times, amateurs, not experts,
p107
aVhave been the inventors and improvers
p108
aVof things ranging from mountain bikes
p109
aVto semiconductors, personal computers,
p110
aVairplanes.
p111
aa(lp112
VThe biggest challenge is that material science is complex
p113
aVand requires expensive equipment.
p114
aVBut that's not always the case.
p115
aVTwo scientists at University of Illinois understood this
p116
aVwhen they published a paper on a simpler method
p117
aVfor making conductive ink.
p118
aVJordan Bunker, who had had
p119
aVno experience with chemistry until then,
p120
aVread this paper and reproduced the experiment
p121
aVat his maker space using only off-the-shelf substances
p122
aVand tools.
p123
aVHe used a toaster oven,
p124
aVand he even made his own vortex mixer,
p125
aVbased on a tutorial by another scientist/maker.
p126
aVJordan then published his results online,
p127
aVincluding all the things he had tried and didn't work,
p128
aVso others could study and reproduce it.
p129
aVSo Jordan's main form of innovation
p130
aVwas to take an experiment created in a well-equipped lab
p131
aVat the university
p132
aVand recreate it in a garage in Chicago
p133
aVusing only cheap materials and tools he made himself.
p134
aVAnd now that he published this work,
p135
aVothers can pick up where he left
p136
aVand devise even simpler processes and improvements.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnother example I'd like to mention
p139
aVis Hannah Perner-Wilson's Kit-of-No-Parts.
p140
aVHer project's goal is to highlight
p141
aVthe expressive qualities of materials
p142
aVwhile focusing on the creativity and skills of the builder.
p143
aVElectronics kits are very powerful
p144
aVin that they teach us how things work,
p145
aVbut the constraints inherent in their design
p146
aVinfluence the way we learn.
p147
aVSo Hannah's approach, on the other hand,
p148
aVis to formulate a series of techniques
p149
aVfor creating unusual objects
p150
aVthat free us from pre-designed constraints
p151
aVby teaching us about the materials themselves.
p152
aVSo amongst Hannah's many impressive experiments,
p153
aVthis is one of my favorites.
p154
aV["Paper speakers"]
p155
aVWhat we're seeing here is just a piece of paper
p156
aVwith some copper tape on it connected to an mp3 player
p157
aVand a magnet.
p158
aV(Music: "Happy Together")
p159
aVSo based on the research by Marcelo Coelho from MIT,
p160
aVHannah created a series of paper speakers
p161
aVout of a wide range of materials
p162
aVfrom simple copper tape to conductive fabric and ink.
p163
aVJust like Jordan and so many other makers,
p164
aVHannah published her recipes
p165
aVand allows anyone to copy and reproduce them.
p166
aa(lp167
VBut paper electronics is one of the most promising branches
p168
aVof material science
p169
aVin that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics.
p170
aVSo Hannah's artisanal work,
p171
aVand the fact that she shared her findings,
p172
aVopens the doors to a series of new possibilities
p173
aVthat are both aesthetically appealing and innovative.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo the interesting thing about makers
p176
aVis that we create out of passion and curiosity,
p177
aVand we are not afraid to fail.
p178
aVWe often tackle problems from unconventional angles,
p179
aVand, in the process, end up discovering alternatives
p180
aVor even better ways to do things.
p181
aVSo the more people experiment with materials,
p182
aVthe more researchers are willing to share their research,
p183
aVand manufacturers their knowledge,
p184
aVthe better chances we have to create technologies
p185
aVthat truly serve us all.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo I feel a bit as Ted Nelson must have
p188
aVwhen, in the early 1970s, he wrote,
p189
aV"You must understand computers now."
p190
aVBack then, computers were these large mainframes
p191
aVonly scientists cared about,
p192
aVand no one dreamed of even having one at home.
p193
aVSo it's a little strange that I'm standing here and saying,
p194
aV"You must understand smart materials now."
p195
aVJust keep in mind that acquiring preemptive knowledge
p196
aVabout emerging technologies
p197
aVis the best way to ensure that we have a say
p198
aVin the making of our future.
p199
aa(lp200
VThank you.

This is a new class of materials that change in response to stimuli: conductive ink, shape-memory plastics, etc. Her goal is to encourage the making of things; to that end, she teaches hands-on workshops on high-tech materials and simple circuitry for both young people and adults--with a side benefit of encouraging interest in science, technology and knowledge-sharing. She&#39;s working on her PhD  researching the social impact of open and collaborative practices for the development of technologies. In other words: Do we make better stuff when we work together?

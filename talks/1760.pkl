VI made a film that was impossible to make,
p5
aVbut I didn't know it was impossible,
p6
aVand that's how I was able to do it.
p7
aa(lp8
V"Mars et Avril" is a science fiction film.
p9
aVIt's set in Montreal some 50 years in the future.
p10
aVNo one had done that kind of movie in Quebec before
p11
aVbecause it's expensive, it's set in the future,
p12
aVand it's got tons of visual effects,
p13
aVand it's shot on green screen.
p14
aVYet this is the kind of movie that I wanted to make
p15
aVever since I was a kid, really,
p16
aVback when I was reading some comic books
p17
aVand dreaming about what the future might be.
p18
aa(lp19
VWhen American producers see my film,
p20
aVthey think that I had a big budget to do it,
p21
aVlike 23 million.
p22
aVBut in fact I had 10 percent of that budget.
p23
aVI did "Mars et Avril" for only 2.3 million.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo you might wonder, what's the deal here?
p26
aVHow did I do this?
p27
aVWell, it's two things. First, it's time.
p28
aVWhen you don't have money, you must take time,
p29
aVand it took me seven years to do "Mars et Avril."
p30
aVThe second aspect is love.
p31
aVI got tons and tons of generosity from everyone involved.
p32
aVAnd it seems like every department had nothing,
p33
aVso they had to rely on our creativity
p34
aVand turn every problem into an opportunity.
p35
aa(lp36
VAnd that brings me to the point of my talk, actually,
p37
aVhow constraints, big creative constraints, can boost creativity.
p38
aa(lp39
VBut let me go back in time a bit.
p40
aVIn my early 20s, I did some graphic novels,
p41
aVbut they weren't your usual graphic novels.
p42
aVThey were books telling a science fiction story
p43
aVthrough images and text,
p44
aVand most of the actors who are now starring
p45
aVin the movie adaptation, they were already involved
p46
aVin these books portraying characters
p47
aVinto a sort of experimental, theatrical, simplistic way.
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd one of these actors is the great stage director
p50
aVand actor Robert Lepage.
p51
aVAnd I just love this guy.
p52
aVI've been in love with this guy since I was a kid.
p53
aVHis career I admire a lot.
p54
aVAnd I wanted this guy to be involved in my crazy project,
p55
aVand he was kind enough to lend his image
p56
aVto the character of Eugène Spaak,
p57
aVwho is a cosmologist and artist who seeks relation
p58
aVin between time, space, love, music and women.
p59
aVAnd he was a perfect fit for the part,
p60
aVand Robert is actually the one who gave me my first chance.
p61
aVHe was the one who believed in me
p62
aVand encouraged me to do an adaptation of my books
p63
aVinto a film, and to write, direct,
p64
aVand produce the film myself.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd Robert is actually the very first example
p67
aVof how constraints can boost creativity.
p68
aVBecause this guy is the busiest man on the planet.
p69
aVI mean, his agenda is booked until 2042,
p70
aVand he's really hard to get,
p71
aVand I wanted him to be in the movie,
p72
aVto reprise his role in the movie.
p73
aVBut the thing is, had I waited
p74
aVfor him until 2042, my film wouldn't be
p75
aVa futuristic film anymore, so I just couldn't do that. Right?
p76
aVBut that's kind of a big problem.
p77
aVHow do you get somebody who is too busy
p78
aVto star in a movie?
p79
aa(lp80
VWell, I said as a joke in a production meeting \u2014
p81
aVand this is a true story, by the way \u2014
p82
aVI said, "Why don't we turn this guy into a hologram?
p83
aVBecause, you know, he is everywhere
p84
aVand nowhere on the planet at the same time,
p85
aVand he's an illuminated being in my mind,
p86
aVand he's in between reality and virtual reality,
p87
aVso it would make perfect sense
p88
aVto turn this guy into a hologram."
p89
aa(lp90
VEverybody around the table laughed,
p91
aVbut the joke was kind of a good solution,
p92
aVso that's what we ended up doing.
p93
aa(lp94
VHere's how we did it. We shot Robert with six cameras.
p95
aVHe was dressed in green and he was like
p96
aVin a green aquarium.
p97
aVEach camera was covering 60 degrees of his head,
p98
aVso that in post-production we could use
p99
aVpretty much any angle we needed,
p100
aVand we shot only his head.
p101
aVSix months later there was a guy on set,
p102
aVa mime portraying the body,
p103
aVthe vehicle for the head.
p104
aVAnd he was wearing a green hood
p105
aVso that we could erase the green hood in postproduction
p106
aVand replace it with Robert Lepage's head.
p107
aVSo he became like a renaissance man,
p108
aVand here's what it looks like in the movie.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Music)
p111
aa(lp112
V(Video) Robert Lepage: [As usual, Arthur's drawing
p113
aVdidn't account for the technical challenges.
p114
aVI welded the breech, but the valve is still gaping.
p115
aVI tried to lift the pallets to lower the pressure in the sound box,
p116
aVbut I might have hit a heartstring.
p117
aVIt still sounds too low.]
p118
aVJacques Languirand: [That's normal.
p119
aVThe instrument always ends up resembling its model.]
p120
aV(Music)
p121
aa(lp122
VMartin Villeneuve: Now these musical instruments
p123
aVthat you see in this excerpt,
p124
aVthey're my second example of how
p125
aVconstraints can boost creativity,
p126
aVbecause I desperately needed these objects in my movie.
p127
aVThey are objects of desire.
p128
aVThey are imaginary musical instruments.
p129
aVAnd they carry a nice story with them.
p130
aVActually, I knew what these things would look like
p131
aVin my mind for many, many years.
p132
aVBut my problem was, I didn't have the money
p133
aVto pay for them. I couldn't afford them.
p134
aVSo that's kind of a big problem too.
p135
aVHow do you get something that you can't afford?
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd, you know, I woke up one morning with a pretty good idea.
p138
aVI said, "What if I have somebody else pay for them?"
p139
aV(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VBut who on Earth would be interested
p142
aVby seven not-yet-built musical instruments
p143
aVinspired by women's bodies?
p144
aVAnd I thought of Cirque du Soleil in Montreal,
p145
aVbecause who better to understand the kind of
p146
aVcrazy poetry that I wanted to put on screen?
p147
aVSo I found my way to Guy Laliberté, Cirque du Soleil's CEO,
p148
aVand I presented my crazy idea to him
p149
aVwith sketches like this and visual references,
p150
aVand something pretty amazing happened.
p151
aVGuy was interested by this idea
p152
aVnot because I was asking for his money,
p153
aVbut because I came to him with a good idea
p154
aVin which everybody was happy.
p155
aVIt was kind of a perfect triangle
p156
aVin which the art buyer was happy
p157
aVbecause he got the instruments at a cheaper price,
p158
aVbecause they weren't even made.
p159
aVHe took a leap of faith.
p160
aVAnd the artist, Dominique Engel, brilliant guy,
p161
aVhe was happy too because he had a dream project
p162
aVto work on for a year.
p163
aVAnd obviously I was happy because I got the instruments
p164
aVin my film for free, which was kind of what I tried to do.
p165
aVSo here they are.
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd my last example of how constraints
p168
aVcan boost creativity
p169
aVcomes from the green,
p170
aVbecause this is a weird color, a crazy color,
p171
aVand you need to replace the green screens eventually
p172
aVand you must figure that out sooner rather than later.
p173
aVAnd I had, again, pretty much, ideas in my mind
p174
aVas to what the world would be,
p175
aVbut then again I turned to my childhood imagination
p176
aVand went to the work of Belgian comic book master
p177
aVFrançois Schuiten in Belgium.
p178
aVAnd this guy is another guy I admire a lot,
p179
aVand I wanted him to be involved in the movie
p180
aVas a production designer.
p181
aVBut people told me, you know, Martin, it's impossible,
p182
aVthe guy is too busy and he will say no.
p183
aVWell, I said, you know what, instead of mimicking his style,
p184
aVI might as well call the real guy and ask him,
p185
aVand I sent him my books,
p186
aVand he answered that he was interested
p187
aVin working on the film with me
p188
aVbecause he could be a big fish in a small aquarium.
p189
aVIn other words, there was space for him to dream with me.
p190
aVSo here I was with one of my childhood heroes,
p191
aVdrawing every single frame that's in the film
p192
aVto turn that into Montreal in the future.
p193
aVAnd it was an amazing collaboration
p194
aVto work with this great artist whom I admire.
p195
aa(lp196
VBut then, you know, eventually you have to turn
p197
aVall these drawings into reality.
p198
aVSo, again, my solution was to aim
p199
aVfor the best possible artist that I could think of.
p200
aVAnd there's this guy in Montreal, another Quebecois
p201
aVcalled Carlos Monzon, and he's a very good VFX artist.
p202
aVThis guy had been lead compositor on such films
p203
aVas "Avatar" and "Star Trek" and "Transformers,"
p204
aVand other unknown projects like this,
p205
aVand I knew he was the perfect fit for the job,
p206
aVand I had to convince him,
p207
aVand, instead of working on the next Spielberg movie,
p208
aVhe accepted to work on mine.
p209
aVWhy? Because I offered him a space to dream.
p210
aVSo if you don't have money to offer to people,
p211
aVyou must strike their imagination with something
p212
aVas nice as you can think of.
p213
aa(lp214
VSo this is what happened on this movie,
p215
aVand that's how it got made,
p216
aVand we went to this very nice postproduction company
p217
aVin Montreal called Vision Globale,
p218
aVand they lent their 60 artists to work full time
p219
aVfor six months to do this crazy film.
p220
aa(lp221
VSo I want to tell you that, if you have some crazy ideas
p222
aVin your mind, and that people tell you
p223
aVthat it's impossible to make,
p224
aVwell, that's an even better reason to want to do it,
p225
aVbecause people have a tendency
p226
aVto see the problems rather than the final result,
p227
aVwhereas if you start to deal with problems
p228
aVas being your allies rather than your opponents,
p229
aVlife will start to dance with you
p230
aVin the most amazing way.
p231
aVI have experienced it.
p232
aVAnd you might end up doing some crazy projects,
p233
aVand who knows, you might even end up
p234
aVgoing to Mars.
p235
aa(lp236
VThank you.

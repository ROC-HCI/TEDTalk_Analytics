VWho are we?
p5
aVThat is the big question.
p6
aVAnd essentially we are just an upright-walking, big-brained,
p7
aVsuper-intelligent ape.
p8
aVThis could be us.
p9
aVWe belong to the family called the Hominidae.
p10
aVWe are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens,
p11
aVand it's important to remember that,
p12
aVin terms of our place in the world today
p13
aVand our future on planet Earth.
p14
aa(lp15
VWe are one species
p16
aVof about five and a half thousand mammalian species
p17
aVthat exist on planet Earth today.
p18
aVAnd that's just a tiny fraction of all species
p19
aVthat have ever lived on the planet in past times.
p20
aVWe're one species out of approximately,
p21
aVor let's say, at least 16 upright-walking apes
p22
aVthat have existed over the past six to eight million years.
p23
aVBut as far as we know, we're the only upright-walking ape
p24
aVthat exists on planet Earth today, except for the bonobos.
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd it's important to remember that,
p27
aVbecause the bonobos are so human,
p28
aVand they share 99 percent of their genes with us.
p29
aVAnd we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes.
p30
aVIt's important to remember that we evolved.
p31
aVNow, I know that's a dirty word for some people,
p32
aVbut we evolved from common ancestors
p33
aVwith the gorillas, the chimpanzee and also the bonobos.
p34
aVWe have a common past, and we have a common future.
p35
aVAnd it is important to remember that all of these great apes
p36
aVhave come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey
p37
aVas we ourselves have today.
p38
aVAnd it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity,
p39
aVand it's this journey that has been the focus
p40
aVof the past three generations of my family,
p41
aVas we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains
p42
aVof our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past.
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd this is how we look for them.
p45
aVA group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly
p46
aVout across vast areas of Africa,
p47
aVlooking for small fragments of bone, fossil bone, that may be on the surface.
p48
aVAnd that's an example of what we may do as we walk across
p49
aVthe landscape in Northern Kenya, looking for fossils.
p50
aVI doubt many of you in the audience can see
p51
aVthe fossil that's in this picture,
p52
aVbut if you look very carefully, there is a jaw, a lower jaw,
p53
aVof a 4.1-million-year-old upright-walking ape
p54
aVas it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side.
p55
aV(Laughter)
p56
aVIt's extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive
p57
aVand it is something that is going to involve a lot more people,
p58
aVto begin to piece together our past.
p59
aVWe still really haven't got a very complete picture of it.
p60
aa(lp61
VWhen we find a fossil, we mark it.
p62
aVToday, we've got great technology: we have GPS.
p63
aVWe mark it with a GPS fix,
p64
aVand we also take a digital photograph of the specimen,
p65
aVso we could essentially put it back on the surface,
p66
aVexactly where we found it.
p67
aVAnd we can bring all this information into big GIS packages, today.
p68
aVWhen we then find something very important,
p69
aVlike the bones of a human ancestor,
p70
aVwe begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly,
p71
aVusing dental picks and fine paintbrushes.
p72
aVAnd all the sediment is then put through these screens,
p73
aVand where we go again through it very carefully,
p74
aVlooking for small bone fragments, and it's then washed.
p75
aa(lp76
VAnd these things are so exciting. They are so often the only,
p77
aVor the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains.
p78
aVAnd here's a very special moment, when my mother and myself
p79
aVwere digging up some remains of human ancestors.
p80
aVAnd it is one of the most special things
p81
aVto ever do with your mother.
p82
aV(Laughter)
p83
aVNot many people can say that.
p84
aa(lp85
VBut now, let me take you back to Africa, two million years ago.
p86
aVI'd just like to point out, if you look at the map of Africa,
p87
aVit does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape.
p88
aVNow we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley.
p89
aVIt essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden,
p90
aVor runs down to Lake Malawi.
p91
aVAnd the Rift Valley is a depression.
p92
aVIt's a basin, and rivers flow down from the highlands into the basin,
p93
aVcarrying sediment, preserving the bones of animals that lived there.
p94
aa(lp95
VIf you want to become a fossil, you actually need to die somewhere
p96
aVwhere your bones will be rapidly buried.
p97
aVYou then hope that the earth moves in such a way
p98
aVas to bring the bones back up to the surface.
p99
aVAnd then you hope that one of us lot
p100
aVwill walk around and find small pieces of you.
p101
aV(Laughter)
p102
aVOK, so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much
p103
aVas we do know today about our ancestors,
p104
aVbecause it's incredibly difficult,
p105
aVA, for these things to become \u2014 to be \u2014 preserved,
p106
aVand secondly, for them to have been brought back up to the surface.
p107
aVAnd we really have only spent 50 years looking for these remains,
p108
aVand begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo, let's go to Lake Turkana, which is one such lake basin
p111
aVin the very north of our country, Kenya.
p112
aVAnd if you look north here, there's a big river that flows into the lake
p113
aVthat's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains
p114
aVof the animals that lived there.
p115
aVFossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin,
p116
aVwhich represents some 20,000 square miles.
p117
aVThat's a huge job that we've got on our hands.
p118
aVTwo million years ago at Lake Turkana,
p119
aVHomo erectus, one of our human ancestors,
p120
aVactually lived in this region.
p121
aVYou can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working
p122
aVin the north. But, essentially, two million years ago,
p123
aVHomo erectus, up in the far right corner,
p124
aVlived alongside three other species of human ancestor.
p125
aVAnd here is a skull of a Homo erectus,
p126
aVwhich I just pulled off the shelf there.
p127
aV(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VBut it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm.
p130
aVIn fact, if you go back in time,
p131
aVit is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids
p132
aVor of human ancestors that coexist at any one time.
p133
aVWhere did these things come from?
p134
aVThat's what we're still trying to find answers to,
p135
aVand it is important to realize that there is diversity
p136
aVin all different species, and our ancestors are no exception.
p137
aVHere's some reconstructions of some of the fossils
p138
aVthat have been found from Lake Turkana.
p139
aa(lp140
VBut I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya,
p141
aVessentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana
p142
aVin search of human remains.
p143
aVAnd we were able to dig up, when we got old enough,
p144
aVfossils such as this, a slender-snouted crocodile.
p145
aVAnd we dug up giant tortoises, and elephants and things like that.
p146
aVBut when I was 12, as I was in this picture,
p147
aVa very exciting expedition was in place on the west side,
p148
aVwhen they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus.
p149
aa(lp150
VI could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well,
p151
aVbecause I was the same age that he was when he died.
p152
aVAnd I imagined him to be tall, dark-skinned.
p153
aVHis brothers certainly were able to run long distances
p154
aVchasing prey, probably sweating heavily as they did so.
p155
aVHe was very able to use stones effectively as tools.
p156
aVAnd this individual himself, this one that I'm holding up here,
p157
aVactually had a bad back. He'd probably had an injury as a child.
p158
aVHe had a scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after
p159
aVquite carefully by other female, and probably much smaller,
p160
aVmembers of his family group, to have got to where he did in life, age 12.
p161
aVUnfortunately for him, he fell into a swamp
p162
aVand couldn't get out.
p163
aVEssentially, his bones were rapidly buried
p164
aVand beautifully preserved.
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd he remained there until 1.6 million years later,
p167
aVwhen this very famous fossil hunter, Kamoya Kimeu,
p168
aVwalked along a small hillside
p169
aVand found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface
p170
aVamongst the pebbles, recognized it as being hominid.
p171
aVIt's actually this little piece up here on the top.
p172
aVWell, an excavation was begun immediately,
p173
aVand more and more little bits of skull
p174
aVstarted to be extracted from the sediment.
p175
aVAnd what was so fun about it was this:
p176
aVthe skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree,
p177
aVand fairly recently the tree had grown up,
p178
aVbut it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside,
p179
aVand so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this,
p180
aVholding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope.
p181
aVWe began to find limb bones; we found finger bones,
p182
aVthe bones of the pelvis, vertebrae, ribs, the collar bones,
p183
aVthings that had never, ever been seen before in Homo erectus.
p184
aVIt was truly exciting.
p185
aVHe had a body very similar to our own,
p186
aVand he was on the threshold of becoming human.
p187
aa(lp188
VWell, shortly afterwards, members of his species
p189
aVstarted to move northwards out of Africa,
p190
aVand you start to see fossils of Homo erectus
p191
aVin Georgia, China and also in parts of Indonesia.
p192
aVSo, Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa
p193
aVand begin its spread across the globe.
p194
aVSome exciting finds, again, as I mentioned,
p195
aVfrom Dmanisi, in the Republic of Georgia.
p196
aVBut also, surprising finds
p197
aVrecently announced from the Island of Flores in Indonesia,
p198
aVwhere a group of these human ancestors have been isolated,
p199
aVand have become dwarfed, and they're only about a meter in height.
p200
aVBut they lived only 18,000 years ago,
p201
aVand that is truly extraordinary to think about.
p202
aa(lp203
VJust to put this in terms of generations,
p204
aVbecause people do find it hard to think of time,
p205
aVHomo erectus left Africa 90,000 generations ago.
p206
aVWe evolved essentially from an African stock.
p207
aVAgain, at about 200,000 years as a fully-fledged us.
p208
aVAnd we only left Africa about 70,000 years ago.
p209
aVAnd until 30,000 years ago, at least three upright-walking apes
p210
aVshared the planet Earth.
p211
aa(lp212
VThe question now is, well, who are we?
p213
aVWe're certainly a polluting, wasteful, aggressive species,
p214
aVwith a few nice things thrown in, perhaps.
p215
aV(Laughter)
p216
aVFor the most part, we're not particularly pleasant at all.
p217
aVWe have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors.
p218
aVIs this a good evolutionary adaptation, or is it going to lead us
p219
aVto being the shortest-lived hominid species on planet Earth?
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd what is it that really makes us us?
p222
aVI think it's our collective intelligence.
p223
aVIt's our ability to write things down,
p224
aVour language and our consciousness.
p225
aVFrom very primitive beginnings, with a very crude tool kit of stones,
p226
aVwe now have a very advanced tool kit, and our tool use
p227
aVhas really reached unprecedented levels:
p228
aVwe've got buggies to Mars; we've mapped the human genome;
p229
aVand recently even created synthetic life, thanks to Craig Venter.
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd we've also managed to communicate with people
p232
aVall over the world, from extraordinary places.
p233
aVEven from within an excavation in northern Kenya,
p234
aVwe can talk to people about what we're doing.
p235
aVAs Al Gore so clearly has reminded us,
p236
aVwe have reached extraordinary numbers
p237
aVof people on this planet.
p238
aVHuman ancestors really only survive on planet Earth,
p239
aVif you look at the fossil record,
p240
aVfor about, on average, a million years at a time.
p241
aVWe've only been around for the past 200,000 years as a species,
p242
aVyet we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people.
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd last year, our population grew by 80 million.
p245
aVI mean, these are extraordinary numbers.
p246
aVYou can see here, again, taken from Al Gore's book.
p247
aVBut what's happened is our technology
p248
aVhas removed the checks and balances on our population growth.
p249
aVWe have to control our numbers, and I think this is as important
p250
aVas anything else that's being done in the world today.
p251
aVBut we have to control our numbers,
p252
aVbecause we can't really hold it together as a species.
p253
aa(lp254
VMy father so appropriately put it,
p255
aVthat "We are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices
p256
aVthat are bad for our survival as a species."
p257
aVCan we hold it together?
p258
aVIt's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa.
p259
aVWe all have an African origin.
p260
aVWe have a common past and we share a common future.
p261
aVEvolutionarily speaking, we're just a blip.
p262
aVWe're sitting on the edge of a precipice,
p263
aVand we have the tools and the technology at our hands
p264
aVto communicate what needs to be done
p265
aVto hold it together today.
p266
aVWe could tell every single human being out there, if we really wanted to.
p267
aVBut will we do that, or will we just let nature take its course?
p268
aa(lp269
VWell, to end on a very positive note,
p270
aVI think evolutionarily speaking,
p271
aVthis is probably a fairly good thing, in the end.
p272
aVI'll leave it at that, thank you very much.

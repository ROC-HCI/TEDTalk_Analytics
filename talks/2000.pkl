VThe most romantic thing to ever happen to me online
p5
aVstarted out the way most things do:
p6
aVwithout me, and not online.
p7
aVOn December 10, 1896, the man on the medal,
p8
aVAlfred Nobel, died.
p9
aVOne hundred years later, exactly, actually,
p10
aVDecember 10, 1996,
p11
aVthis charming lady, Wislawa Szymborska,
p12
aVwon the Nobel Prize for literature.
p13
aVShe's a Polish poet.
p14
aVShe's a big deal, obviously,
p15
aVbut back in '96, I thought I had never heard of her,
p16
aVand when I checked out her work,
p17
aVI found this sweet little poem,
p18
aV"Four in the Morning."
p19
aa(lp20
V"The hour from night to day.
p21
aVThe hour from side to side.
p22
aVThe hour for those past thirty..."
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd it goes on, but as soon as I read this poem,
p25
aVI fell for it hard,
p26
aVso hard, I suspected we must have met
p27
aVsomewhere before.
p28
aVHad I shared an elevator ride with this poem?
p29
aVDid I flirt with this poem
p30
aVin a coffee shop somewhere?
p31
aVI could not place it, and it bugged me,
p32
aVand then in the coming week or two,
p33
aVI would just be watching an old movie,
p34
aVand this would happen.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Video) Groucho Marx: Charlie, you should have come to the first party.
p37
aVWe didn't get home till around four in the morning.
p38
aa(lp39
VRives: My roommates would have the TV on,
p40
aVand this would happen.
p41
aa(lp42
V(Music: Seinfeld theme)
p43
aa(lp44
V(Video) George Costanza: Oh boy,  I was up til four in the morning
p45
aVwatching that Omen trilogy.
p46
aa(lp47
VRives: I would be listening to music,
p48
aVand this would happen.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Video) Elton John: \u266a It's four o'clock in the morning, damn it. \u266a
p51
aa(lp52
VRives: So you can see what was going on, right?
p53
aVObviously, the demigods of coincidence
p54
aVwere just messing with me.
p55
aVSome people get a number stuck in their head,
p56
aVyou may recognize a certain name or a tune,
p57
aVsome people get nothing, but four in the morning
p58
aVwas in me now, but mildly,
p59
aVlike a groin injury.
p60
aVI always assumed it would just go away
p61
aVon its own eventually,
p62
aVand I never talked about it with anybody,
p63
aVbut it did not, and I totally did.
p64
aa(lp65
VIn 2007, I was invited to speak at TED
p66
aVfor the second time,
p67
aVand since I was still an authority on nothing,
p68
aVI thought, what if I made a multimedia presentation
p69
aVon a topic so niche
p70
aVit is actually inconsequential
p71
aVor actually cockamamie.
p72
aVSo my talk had some of my four in the morning examples,
p73
aVbut it also had examples
p74
aVfrom my fellow TED speakers that year.
p75
aVI found four in the morning in a novel
p76
aVby Isabel Allende.
p77
aVI found a really great one
p78
aVin the autobiography of Bill Clinton.
p79
aVI found a couple in the work of Matt Groening,
p80
aValthough Matt Groening told me later
p81
aVthat he could not make my talk
p82
aVbecause it was a morning session
p83
aVand I gather that he is not an early riser.
p84
aVHowever, had Matt been there,
p85
aVhe would have seen this mock conspiracy theory
p86
aVthat was un-freaking-canny for me to assemble.
p87
aVIt was totally contrived
p88
aVjust for that room, just for that moment.
p89
aVThat's how we did it in the pre-TED.com days.
p90
aVIt was fun. That was pretty much it.
p91
aa(lp92
VWhen I got home, though, the emails started coming in
p93
aVfrom people who had seen the talk live,
p94
aVbeginning with, and this is still my favorite,
p95
aV"Here's another one for your collection:
p96
aV'It's the friends you can call up at 4 a.m. that matter.'"
p97
aVThe sentiment is Marlene Dietrich.
p98
aVThe email itself was from another very
p99
aVsexy European type,
p100
aVTED Curator Chris Anderson.
p101
aV(Laughter)
p102
aVChris found this quote
p103
aVon a coffee cup or something,
p104
aVand I'm thinking, this man is the Typhoid Mary
p105
aVof ideas worth spreading, and I have infected him.
p106
aVI am contagious,
p107
aVwhich was confirmed less than a week later
p108
aVwhen a Hallmark employee scanned and sent
p109
aVan actual greeting card
p110
aVwith that same quotation.
p111
aVAs a bonus, she hooked me up with a second one they make.
p112
aVIt says, "Just knowing I can call you
p113
aVat four in the morning if I need to
p114
aVmakes me not really need to,"
p115
aVwhich I love, because together these are like,
p116
aV"Hallmark: When you care enough
p117
aVto send the very best twice,
p118
aVphrased slightly differently."
p119
aa(lp120
VI was not surprised at the TEDster
p121
aVand New Yorker magazine overlap.
p122
aVA bunch of people sent me this when it came out.
p123
aV"It's 4 a.m.\u2014maybe you'd sleep better if you bought some crap."
p124
aa(lp125
VI was surprised at the TEDster/"Rugrats" overlap.
p126
aVMore than one person sent me this.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Video) Didi Pickles: It's four o'clock in the morning.
p129
aVWhy on Earth are you making chocolate pudding?
p130
aa(lp131
VStu Pickles: Because I've lost control of my life.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VRives: And then there was the lone TEDster
p136
aVwho was disgruntled I had overlooked
p137
aVwhat he considers to be a classic.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Video) Roy Neary: Get up, get up! I'm not kidding. Ronnie Neary: Is there an accident?
p140
aa(lp141
VRoy: No, it's not an accident. You wanted to get out of the house anyway, right?
p142
aa(lp143
VRonnie: Not at four o'clock in the morning.
p144
aa(lp145
VRives: So that's "Close Encounters,"
p146
aVand the main character is all worked up
p147
aVbecause aliens, momentously,
p148
aVhave chosen to show themselves to earthlings
p149
aVat four in the morning,
p150
aVwhich does make that a very solid example.
p151
aVThose were all really solid examples.
p152
aVThey did not get me any closer to understanding
p153
aVwhy I thought I recognized this one particular poem.
p154
aVBut they followed the pattern. They played along.
p155
aVRight? Four in the morning as this scapegoat hour
p156
aVwhen all these dramatic occurrences
p157
aVallegedly occur.
p158
aVMaybe this was some kind of cliche
p159
aVthat had never been taxonomized before.
p160
aVMaybe I was on the trail
p161
aVof a new meme or something.
p162
aa(lp163
VJust when things were getting pretty interesting,
p164
aVthings got really interesting.
p165
aVTED.com launched, later that year,
p166
aVwith a bunch of videos from past talks,
p167
aVincluding mine,
p168
aVand I started receiving "four in the morning" citations
p169
aVfrom what seemed like every time zone on the planet.
p170
aVMuch of it was content I never would have found
p171
aVon my own if I was looking for it,
p172
aVand I was not.
p173
aVI don't know anybody with juvenile diabetes.
p174
aVI probably would have missed the booklet,
p175
aV"Grilled Cheese at Four O'Clock in the Morning."
p176
aV(Laughter)
p177
aVI do not subscribe to Crochet Today! magazine,
p178
aValthough it looks delightful. (Laughter)
p179
aVTake note of those clock ends.
p180
aVThis is a college student's suggestion
p181
aVfor what a "four in the morning" gang sign
p182
aVshould look like.
p183
aVPeople sent me magazine ads.
p184
aVThey took photographs in grocery stores.
p185
aVI got a ton of graphic novels and comics.
p186
aVA lot of good quality work, too:
p187
aV"The Sandman," "Watchmen."
p188
aVThere's a very cute example here from "Calvin and Hobbes."
p189
aVIn fact, the oldest citation anybody sent in
p190
aVwas from a cartoon from the Stone Age.
p191
aVTake a look.
p192
aa(lp193
V(Video) Wilma Flintstone: Like how early?
p194
aa(lp195
VFred Flintstone: Like at 4 a.m., that's how early.
p196
aa(lp197
VRives: And the flip side of the timeline,
p198
aVthis is from the 31st century.
p199
aVA thousand years from now,
p200
aVpeople are still doing this.
p201
aa(lp202
V(Video): Announcer: The time is 4 a.m.
p203
aV(Laughter)
p204
aVRives: It shows the spectrum.
p205
aVI received so many songs, TV shows, movies,
p206
aVlike from dismal to famous,
p207
aVI could give you a four-hour playlist.
p208
aVIf I just stick to modern male movie stars,
p209
aVI keep it to the length
p210
aVof about a commercial.
p211
aVHere's your sampler.
p212
aa(lp213
V(Movie montage of "It's 4 a.m.")
p214
aa(lp215
V(Laughter)
p216
aa(lp217
VRives: So somewhere along the line,
p218
aVI realized I have a hobby
p219
aVI didn't know I wanted,
p220
aVand it is crowdsourced.
p221
aVBut I was also thinking what you might be thinking,
p222
aVwhich is really, couldn't you do this
p223
aVwith any hour of the day?
p224
aa(lp225
VFirst of all, you are not getting clips like that
p226
aVabout four in the afternoon.
p227
aVSecondly, I did a little research.
p228
aVYou know, I was kind of interested.
p229
aVIf this is confirmation bias,
p230
aVthere is so much confirmation, I am biased.
p231
aVLiterature probably shows it best.
p232
aVThere are a couple three in the mornings in Shakespeare.
p233
aVThere's a five in the morning.
p234
aVThere are seven four in the mornings,
p235
aVand they're all very dire.
p236
aVIn "Measure for Measure," it's the call time for the executioner.
p237
aVTolstoy gives Napoleon insomnia
p238
aVat four in the morning right before battle
p239
aVin "War and Peace."
p240
aVCharlotte Brontë's "Jane Eyre" has got kind of
p241
aVa pivotal four in the morning,
p242
aVas does Emily Brontë's "Wuthering Heights."
p243
aV"Lolita" has as a creepy four in the morning.
p244
aV"Huckleberry Finn" has one in dialect.
p245
aVSomeone sent in H.G. Wells' "The Invisible Man."
p246
aVSomeone else sent in Ralph Ellison's "Invisible Man."
p247
aV"The Great Gatsby" spends the last
p248
aVfour in the morning of his life
p249
aVwaiting for a lover who never shows,
p250
aVand the most famous wake-up in literature, perhaps,
p251
aV"The Metamorphosis."
p252
aVFirst paragraph, the main character wakes up
p253
aVtransformed into a giant cockroach,
p254
aVbut we already know, cockroach notwithstanding,
p255
aVsomething is up with this guy.
p256
aVWhy? His alarm is set for four o'clock in the morning.
p257
aVWhat kind of person would do that?
p258
aVThis kind of person would do that.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Music)
p261
aa(lp262
V(4 a.m. alarm clock montage)
p263
aV(Video) Newcaster: Top of the hour. Time for the morning news.
p264
aVBut of course, there is no news yet.
p265
aVEveryone's still asleep in their comfy, comfy beds.
p266
aa(lp267
VRives: Exactly.
p268
aVSo that's Lucy from the Peanuts,
p269
aV"Mommie Dearest", Rocky, first day of training,
p270
aVNelson Mandela, first day in office,
p271
aVand Bart Simpson, which combined with a cockroach
p272
aVwould give you one hell of a dinner party
p273
aVand gives me yet another category,
p274
aVpeople waking up, in my big old database.
p275
aa(lp276
VJust imagine that your friends and your family
p277
aVhave heard that you collect, say, stuffed polar bears,
p278
aVand they send them to you.
p279
aVEven if you don't really, at a certain point,
p280
aVyou totally collect stuffed polar bears,
p281
aVand your collection is probably pretty kick-ass.
p282
aVAnd when I got to that point, I embraced it.
p283
aVI got my curator on. I started fact checking,
p284
aVdownloading, illegally screen-grabbing.
p285
aVI started archiving.
p286
aVMy hobby had become a habit,
p287
aVand my habit gave me possibly the world's
p288
aVmost eclectic Netflix queue.
p289
aVAt one point, it went, "Guys and Dolls: The Musical,"
p290
aV"Last Tango in Paris,"
p291
aV"Diary of a Wimpy Kid,"
p292
aV"Porn Star: Legend of Ron Jeremy."
p293
aVWhy "Porn Star: Legend of Ron Jeremy"?
p294
aVBecause someone told me I would find this clip in there.
p295
aa(lp296
V(Video) Ron Jeremy: I was born
p297
aVin Flushing, Queens
p298
aVon March, 12, 1953,
p299
aVat four o'clock in the morning.
p300
aa(lp301
VRives: Of course he was. (Laughter) (Applause)
p302
aVYeah. Not only does it seem to make sense,
p303
aVit also answers the question,
p304
aV"What do Ron Jeremy and Simone de Beauvoir
p305
aVhave in common?"
p306
aVSimone de Beauvoir begins her entire autobiography
p307
aVwith the sentence, "I was born at four o'clock in the morning,"
p308
aVwhich I had because someone else had emailed it to me,
p309
aVand when they did, I had another bump up
p310
aVin my entry for this, because porn star Ron Jeremy
p311
aVand feminist Simone de Beauvoir
p312
aVare not just different people.
p313
aVThey are different people that have this thing connecting them,
p314
aVand I did not know if that is trivia or knowledge
p315
aVor inadvertent expertise, but I did wonder,
p316
aVis there maybe a cooler way to do this?
p317
aa(lp318
VSo last October, in gentleman scholar tradition,
p319
aVI put the entire collection online
p320
aVas "Museum of Four in the Morning."
p321
aVYou can click on that red "refresh" button.
p322
aVIt will take you at random to one of
p323
aVhundreds of snippets that are in the collection.
p324
aVHere is a knockout poem
p325
aVby Billy Collins called "Forgetfulness."
p326
aa(lp327
V(Video) Billy Collins: No wonder you rise
p328
aVin the middle of the night
p329
aVto look up the date of a famous battle
p330
aVin a book on war.
p331
aVNo wonder the moon in the window
p332
aVseems to have drifted out of a love poem
p333
aVthat you used to know by heart.
p334
aa(lp335
VRives: So the first hour of this project
p336
aVwas satisfying.
p337
aVA Bollywood actor sang a line on a DVD in a cafe.
p338
aVHalf a globe away, a teenager
p339
aVmade an Instagram video of it and sent it to me,
p340
aVa stranger.
p341
aa(lp342
VLess than a week later, though,
p343
aVI received a little bit of grace.
p344
aVI received a poignant tweet.
p345
aVIt was brief.
p346
aVIt just said, "Reminds me of an ancient mix tape."
p347
aa(lp348
VThe name was a pseudonym, actually, or a pseudo-pseudonym.
p349
aVAs soon as I saw the initials, and the profile pic,
p350
aVI knew immediately, my whole body knew
p351
aVimmediately who this was,
p352
aVand I knew immediately
p353
aVwhat mix tape she was talking about.
p354
aV(Music)
p355
aa(lp356
VL.D. was my college romance.
p357
aVThis is in the early '90s. I was an undegrad.
p358
aVShe was a grad student in the library sciences department.
p359
aVNot the kind of librarian that takes her glasses off,
p360
aVlets her hair down, suddenly she's smoking hot.
p361
aVShe was already smoking hot,
p362
aVshe was super dorky,
p363
aVand we had a December-May romance,
p364
aVmeaning we started dating in December,
p365
aVand by May, she had graduated
p366
aVand became my one that got away.
p367
aa(lp368
VBut her mix tape did not get away.
p369
aVI have kept this mix tape in a box
p370
aVwith notes and postcards, not just from L.D.,
p371
aVfrom my life, but for decades.
p372
aVIt's the kind of box where,
p373
aVif I have a girlfriend, I tend to hide it from her,
p374
aVand if I had a wife, I'm sure I would share it with her,
p375
aVbut the story \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 with this mix tape
p376
aVis there are seven songs per side,
p377
aVbut no song titles.
p378
aVInstead, L.D. has used the U.S. Library of Congress
p379
aVclassification system, including page numbers,
p380
aVto leave me clues.
p381
aVWhen I got this mix tape,
p382
aVI put it in my cassette player,
p383
aVI took it to the campus library, her library,
p384
aVI found 14 books on the shelves.
p385
aVI remember bringing them all
p386
aVto my favorite corner table,
p387
aVand I read poems paired to songs
p388
aVlike food to wine,
p389
aVpaired, I can tell you,
p390
aVlike saddle shoes
p391
aVto a cobalt blue vintage cotton dress.
p392
aa(lp393
VI did this again last October.
p394
aVI'm sitting there, I got new earbuds,
p395
aVold Walkman, I realize this is just the kind
p396
aVof extravagance I used to take for granted
p397
aVeven when I was extravagant.
p398
aVAnd then I thought, "Good for him."
p399
aa(lp400
V"PG" is Slavic literature.
p401
aV"7000" series Polish literature.
p402
aVZ9A24 is a collection of 70 poems.
p403
aVPage 31 is Wislawa Szymborska's poem
p404
aVpaired with Paul Simon's "Peace Like a River."
p405
aa(lp406
V(Music: Paul Simon, "Peace Like a River")
p407
aa(lp408
V(Video) Paul Simon: \u266a Oh, four in the morning \u266a
p409
aV\u266a I woke up from out of my dream \u266a
p410

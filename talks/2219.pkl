V"Where are you from?" said the pale, tattooed man.
p5
aV"Where are you from?"
p6
aVIt's September 21, 2001,
p7
aV10 days after the worst attack on America since World War II.
p8
aVEveryone wonders about the next plane.
p9
aVPeople are looking for scapegoats.
p10
aVThe president,  the night before, pledges to
p11
aV"bring our enemies to justice  or bring justice to our enemies."
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd in the Dallas mini-mart,
p14
aVa Dallas mini-part surrounded by tire shops and strip joints
p15
aVa Bangladeshi immigrant  works the register.
p16
aVBack home, Raisuddin Bhuiyan was a big man, an Air Force officer.
p17
aVBut he dreamed of a  fresh start in America.
p18
aVIf he had to work briefly in a mini-mart to save up for I.T. classes
p19
aVand his wedding in two months, so be it.
p20
aa(lp21
VThen, on September 21,  that tattooed man enters the mart.
p22
aVHe holds a shotgun.
p23
aVRaisuddin knows the drill:
p24
aVputs cash on the counter.
p25
aVThis time, the man doesn't  touch the money.
p26
aV"Where are you from?" he asks.
p27
aV"Excuse me?" Raisuddin answers.
p28
aVHis accent betrays him.
p29
aVThe tattooed man, a self-styled true American vigilante,
p30
aVshoots Raisuddin in revenge for 9/11.
p31
aVRaisuddin feels millions of bees stinging his face.
p32
aVIn fact, dozens of scalding,  birdshot pellets puncture his head.
p33
aa(lp34
VBehind the counter, he lays in blood.
p35
aVHe cups a hand over his forehead to keep in the brains
p36
aVon which he'd gambled everything.
p37
aVHe recites verses from the Koran, begging his God to live.
p38
aVHe senses he is dying.
p39
aa(lp40
VHe didn't die.
p41
aVHis right eye left him.
p42
aVHis fiancée left him.
p43
aVHis landlord, the mini-mart owner, kicked him out.
p44
aVSoon he was homeless and  60,000 dollars in medical debt,
p45
aVincluding a fee for dialing  for an ambulance.
p46
aVBut Raisuddin lived.
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd years later, he would ask what he could do to repay his God
p49
aVand become worthy of this second chance.
p50
aVHe would come to believe, in fact,
p51
aVthat this chance called for him to give a second chance
p52
aVto a man we might think deserved no chance at all.
p53
aa(lp54
VTwelve years ago, I was a fresh graduate seeking my way in the world.
p55
aVBorn in Ohio to Indian immigrants,
p56
aVI settled on the ultimate rebellion  against my parents,
p57
aVmoving to the country they had worked so damn hard to get out of.
p58
aVWhat I thought might be a six-month stint in Mumbai stretched to six years.
p59
aVI became a writer and found myself amid a magical story:
p60
aVthe awakening of hope across much of the so-called Third World.
p61
aVSix years ago, I returned to America and realized something:
p62
aVThe American Dream was thriving,
p63
aVbut only in India.
p64
aVIn America, not so much.
p65
aa(lp66
VIn fact, I observed that  America was fracturing
p67
aVinto two distinct societies:
p68
aVa republic of dreams and a republic of fears.
p69
aVAnd then, I stumbled onto this  incredible tale of two lives
p70
aVand of these two Americas that brutally collided in that Dallas mini-mart.
p71
aVI knew at once I wanted to learn more,
p72
aVand eventually that I would write a book about them,
p73
aVfor their story was the story  of America's fracturing
p74
aVand of how it might be put back together.
p75
aa(lp76
VAfter he was shot, Raisuddin's life grew no easier.
p77
aVThe day after admitting him, the hospital discharged him.
p78
aVHis right eye couldn't see.
p79
aVHe couldn't speak.
p80
aVMetal peppered his face.
p81
aVBut he had no insurance,  so they bounced him.
p82
aVHis family in Bangladesh  begged him, "Come home."
p83
aVBut he told them he had  a dream to see about.
p84
aa(lp85
VHe found telemarketing work,
p86
aVthen he became an Olive Garden waiter,
p87
aVbecause where better to get over his fear of white people than the Olive Garden?
p88
aV(Laughter)
p89
aVNow, as a devout Muslim, he refused alcohol,
p90
aVdidn't touch the stuff.
p91
aVThen he learned that not selling it would slash his pay.
p92
aVSo he reasoned, like a budding  American pragmatist,
p93
aV"Well, God wouldn't want me to starve, would he?"
p94
aVAnd before long, in some months,  Raisuddin was that Olive Garden's
p95
aVhighest grossing alcohol pusher.
p96
aVHe found a man who taught him database administration.
p97
aVHe got part-time I.T. gigs.
p98
aVEventually, he landed a six-figure job at a blue chip tech company in Dallas.
p99
aa(lp100
VBut as America began to work for Raisuddin,
p101
aVhe avoided the classic error of the fortunate:
p102
aVassuming you're the rule,  not the exception.
p103
aVIn fact, he observed that many with the fortune of being born American
p104
aVwere nonetheless trapped in lives that  made second chances like his impossible.
p105
aVHe saw it at the Olive Garden itself,
p106
aVwhere so many of his colleagues had childhood horror stories
p107
aVof family dysfunction, chaos,  addiction, crime.
p108
aVHe'd heard a similar tale about the man who shot him
p109
aVback when he attended his trial.
p110
aVThe closer Raisuddin got to the America he had coveted from afar,
p111
aVthe more he realized there was another, equally real, America
p112
aVthat was stingier with second chances.
p113
aVThe man who shot Raisuddin grew up in that stingier America.
p114
aa(lp115
VFrom a distance, Mark Stroman was always the spark of parties,
p116
aValways making girls feel pretty.
p117
aVAlways working, no matter what  drugs or fights he'd had the night before.
p118
aVBut he'd always wrestled with demons.
p119
aVHe entered the world through the three gateways
p120
aVthat doom so many young American men:
p121
aVbad parents, bad schools, bad prisons.
p122
aVHis mother told him, regretfully, as a boy
p123
aVthat she'd been just 50 dollars  short of aborting him.
p124
aVSometimes, that little boy  would be at school,
p125
aVhe'd suddenly pull a knife  on his fellow classmates.
p126
aVSometimes that same little boy would be at his grandparents',
p127
aVtenderly feeding horses.
p128
aVHe was getting arrested before he shaved,
p129
aVfirst juvenile, then prison.
p130
aVHe became a casual white supremacist
p131
aVand, like so many around him,  a drug-addled and absent father.
p132
aVAnd then, before long, he found himself on death row,
p133
aVfor in his 2001 counter-jihad,  he had shot not one mini-mart clerk,
p134
aVbut three.
p135
aVOnly Raisuddin survived.
p136
aa(lp137
VStrangely, death row was  the first institution
p138
aVthat left Stroman better.
p139
aVHis old influences quit him.
p140
aVThe people entering his life  were virtuous and caring:
p141
aVpastors, journalists, European pen-pals.
p142
aVThey listened to him, prayed with him, helped him question himself.
p143
aVAnd sent him on a journey  of introspection and betterment.
p144
aVHe finally faced the hatred  that had defined his life.
p145
aVHe read Viktor Frankl,  the Holocaust survivor
p146
aVand regretted his swastika tattoos.
p147
aVHe found God.
p148
aVThen one day in 2011,  10 years after his crimes,
p149
aVStroman received news.
p150
aVOne of the men he'd shot, the survivor, was fighting to save his life.
p151
aa(lp152
VYou see, late in 2009, eight years after that shooting,
p153
aVRaisuddin had gone on his own journey, a pilgrimage to Mecca.
p154
aVAmid its crowds,  he felt immense gratitude,
p155
aVbut also duty.
p156
aVHe recalled promising God,  as he lay dying in 2001,
p157
aVthat if he lived, he would serve  humanity all his days.
p158
aVThen, he'd gotten busy  relaying the bricks of a life.
p159
aVNow it was time to pay his debts.
p160
aVAnd he decided, upon reflection, that his method of payment
p161
aVwould be an intervention  in the cycle of vengeance
p162
aVbetween the Muslim and Western worlds.
p163
aVAnd how would he intervene?
p164
aVBy forgiving Stroman publicly in the name of Islam
p165
aVand its doctrine of mercy.
p166
aVAnd then suing the state of Texas and its governor Rick Perry
p167
aVto prevent them from executing Stroman,
p168
aVexactly like most people  shot in the face do.
p169
aV(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VYet Raisuddin's mercy was inspired  not only by faith.
p172
aVA newly minted American citizen, he had come to believe that Stroman
p173
aVwas the product of a hurting America that couldn't just be lethally injected away.
p174
aVThat insight is what moved me  to write my book "The True American."
p175
aVThis immigrant begging America  to be as merciful to a native son
p176
aVas it had been to an adopted one.
p177
aVIn the mini-mart, all those years earlier,
p178
aVnot just two men,  but two Americas collided.
p179
aVAn America that still dreams,  still strives,
p180
aVstill imagines that tomorrow can build on today,
p181
aVand an America that has resigned to fate,
p182
aVbuckled under stress and chaos, lowered expectations,
p183
aVan ducked into the oldest of refuges:
p184
aVthe tribal fellowship of one's own narrow kind.
p185
aVAnd it was Raisuddin, despite being a newcomer,
p186
aVdespite being attacked,
p187
aVdespite being homeless and traumatized,
p188
aVwho belonged to that republic of dreams
p189
aVand Stroman who belonged to that  other wounded country,
p190
aVdespite being born with the privilege of a native white man.
p191
aa(lp192
VI realized these men's stories formed an urgent parable about America.
p193
aVThe country I am so proud to call my own
p194
aVwasn't living through a  generalized decline
p195
aVas seen in Spain or Greece,  where prospects were dimming for everyone.
p196
aVAmerica is simultaneously the most and the least successful country
p197
aVin the industrialized world.
p198
aVLaunching the world's best companies,
p199
aVeven as record numbers  of children go hungry.
p200
aVSeeing life-expectancy drop for large groups,
p201
aVeven as it polishes  the world's best hospitals.
p202
aVAmerica today is a sprightly young body,
p203
aVhit by one of those strokes  that sucks the life from one side,
p204
aVwhile leaving the other worryingly perfect.
p205
aa(lp206
VOn July 20, 2011, right after  a sobbing Raisuddin
p207
aVtestified in defense of Stroman's life,
p208
aVStroman was killed by lethal injection by the state he so loved.
p209
aVHours earlier, when Raisuddin still thought he could still save Stroman,
p210
aVthe two men got to speak  for the second time ever.
p211
aVHere is an excerpt from their phone call.
p212
aVRaisuddin: "Mark, you should know  that I am praying for God,
p213
aVthe most compassionate and gracious.
p214
aVI forgive you and I do not hate you.
p215
aVI never hated you."
p216
aVStroman: "You are a remarkable person.
p217
aVThank you from my heart.
p218
aVI love you, bro."
p219
aa(lp220
VEven more amazingly, after the execution,
p221
aVRaisuddin reached out to Stroman's  eldest daughter, Amber,
p222
aVan ex-convinct and an addict.
p223
aVand offered his help.
p224
aV"You may have lost a father," he told her,
p225
aV"but you've gained an uncle."
p226
aVHe wanted her, too, to have  a second chance.
p227
aa(lp228
VIf human history were a parade,
p229
aVAmerica's float would be  a neon shrine to second chances.
p230
aVBut America, generous with second chances to the children of other lands,
p231
aVtoday grows miserly with first chances to the children of its own.
p232
aVAmerica still dazzles at allowing anybody to become an American.
p233
aVBut it is losing its luster at allowing every American to become a somebody.
p234
aa(lp235
VOver the last decade, seven million foreigners gained American citizenship.
p236
aVRemarkable.
p237
aVIn the meanwhile, how many Americans gained a place in the middle class?
p238
aVActually, the net influx was negative.
p239
aVGo back further,  and it's even more striking:
p240
aVSince the 60s, the middle class has shrunk by 20 percent,
p241
aVmainly because of the people tumbling out of it.
p242
aVAnd my reporting around the country tells me the problem is grimmer
p243
aVthan simple inequality.
p244
aVWhat I observe is a pair of secessions from the unifying center of American life.
p245
aVAn affluent secession of up, up and away,
p246
aVinto elite enclaves of the educated and into a global matrix
p247
aVof work, money and connections,
p248
aVand an impoverished secession  of down and out
p249
aVinto disconnected, dead-end lives
p250
aVthat the fortunate scarcely see.
p251
aa(lp252
VAnd don't console yourself  that you are the 99 percent.
p253
aVIf you live near a Whole Foods,
p254
aVif no one in your family serves  in the military,
p255
aVif you're paid by the year, not the hour,
p256
aVif most people you know finished college,
p257
aVif no one you know uses meth,
p258
aVif you married once and remain married,
p259
aVif you're not one of 65 million Americans with a criminal record \u2014
p260
aVif any or all of these things  describe you,
p261
aVthen accept the possibility that actually,
p262
aVyou may not know what's going on
p263
aVand you may be part of the problem.
p264
aa(lp265
VOther generations had to build  a fresh society after slavery,
p266
aVpull through a depression, defeat fascism,
p267
aVfreedom-ride in Mississippi.
p268
aVThe moral challenge of  my generation, I believe,
p269
aVis to reacquaint these two Americas,
p270
aVto choose union over secession once again.
p271
aVThis ins't a problem we can tax or tax-cut away.
p272
aVIt won't be solved by tweeting harder, building slicker apps,
p273
aVor starting one more  artisanal coffee roasting service.
p274
aVIt is a moral challenge that begs  each of us in the flourishing America
p275
aVto take on the wilting America as our own,
p276
aVas Raisuddin tried to do.
p277
aa(lp278
VLike him, we can make pilgrimages.
p279
aVAnd there, in Baltimore and Oregon  and Appalachia,
p280
aVfind new purpose, as he did.
p281
aVWe can immerse ourselves  in that other country,
p282
aVbear witness to its hopes and sorrows,
p283
aVand, like Raisuddin, ask what we can do.
p284
aVWhat can you do?
p285
aVWhat can you do?
p286
aVWhat can we do?
p287
aVHow might we build  a more merciful country?
p288
aa(lp289
VWe, the greatest inventors in the world,
p290
aVcan invent solutions to the problems  of that America, not only our own.
p291
aVWe, the writers and the journalists,  can cover that America's stories,
p292
aVinstead of shutting down  bureaus in its midst.
p293
aVWe can finance that America's ideas,
p294
aVinstead of ideas from New York  and San Francisco.
p295
aVWe can put our stethoscopes to its backs,
p296
aVteach there, go to court there, make there, live there, pray there.
p297
aa(lp298
VThis, I believe, is the calling  of a generation.
p299
aVAn America whose two halves learn again
p300
aVto stride, to plow, to forge, to dare together.
p301
aVA republic of chances, rewoven, renewed,
p302
aVbegins with us.
p303
aa(lp304
VThank you.
p305

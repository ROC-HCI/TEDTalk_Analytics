VWhat I'm going to do is to just give a few notes,
p5
aVand this is from a book I'm preparing called
p6
aV"Letters to a Young Scientist."
p7
aVI'd thought it'd be appropriate to
p8
aVpresent it, on the basis that I have had extensive experience
p9
aVin teaching, counseling scientists across a broad array of fields.
p10
aVAnd you might like to hear some of the principles that I've developed in doing
p11
aVthat teaching and counseling.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo let me begin by urging you,
p14
aVparticularly you on the youngsters' side,
p15
aVon this path you've chosen,
p16
aVto go as far as you can.
p17
aVThe world needs you, badly.
p18
aVHumanity is now fully into the techno-scientific age.
p19
aVThere is going to be no turning back.
p20
aa(lp21
VAlthough varying among disciplines \u2014 say, astrophysics,
p22
aVmolecular genetics, the immunology, the microbiology, the public
p23
aVhealth, to the new area of the human body as a symbiont,
p24
aVto public health, environmental science.
p25
aVKnowledge in medical science and science overall
p26
aVis doubling every 15 to 20 years.
p27
aVTechnology is increasing at a comparable rate.
p28
aVBetween them, the two already pervade,
p29
aVas most of you here seated realize,
p30
aVevery dimension of human life.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo swift is the velocity of the techno-scientific revolution,
p33
aVso startling in its countless twists and turns, that no one can predict
p34
aVits outcome even a decade from the present moment.
p35
aa(lp36
VThere will come a time, of course,
p37
aVwhen the exponential growth of discovery and knowledge,
p38
aVwhich actually began in the 1600s,
p39
aVhas to peak and level off,
p40
aVbut that's not going to matter to you.
p41
aVThe revolution is going to continue
p42
aVfor at least several more decades.
p43
aVIt'll render the human condition
p44
aVradically different from what it is today.
p45
aVTraditional fields of study are going to continue to grow
p46
aVand in so doing, inevitably they will meet and create new disciplines.
p47
aa(lp48
VIn time, all of science will come to be
p49
aVa continuum of description, an explanation of networks, of principles and laws.
p50
aVThat's why you need not just be training
p51
aVin one specialty, but also acquire breadth in other fields,
p52
aVrelated to and even distant from your own initial choice.
p53
aa(lp54
VKeep your eyes lifted and your head turning.
p55
aVThe search for knowledge is in our genes.
p56
aVIt was put there by our distant ancestors
p57
aVwho spread across the world,
p58
aVand it's never going to be quenched.
p59
aVTo understand and use it sanely,
p60
aVas a part of the civilization yet to evolve
p61
aVrequires a vastly larger population of scientifically trained people like you.
p62
aVIn education, medicine, law, diplomacy,
p63
aVgovernment, business and the media that exist today.
p64
aa(lp65
VOur political leaders need at least a modest degree of scientific
p66
aVliteracy, which most badly lack today \u2014
p67
aVno applause, please.
p68
aVIt will be better for all
p69
aVif they prepare before entering office rather than learning on the job.
p70
aVTherefore you will do well to act on the side,
p71
aVno matter how far into the laboratory
p72
aVyou may go, to serve as teachers
p73
aVduring the span of your career.
p74
aa(lp75
VI'll now proceed quickly,
p76
aVand before else, to a subject that is both a vital asset
p77
aVand a potential barrier to a scientific career.
p78
aVIf you are a bit short in mathematical skills,
p79
aVdon't worry.
p80
aVMany of the most successful scientists
p81
aVat work today are mathematically semi-literate.
p82
aa(lp83
VA metaphor will serve here:
p84
aVWhere elite mathematicians and statisticians
p85
aVand theorists often serve as architects in the expanding realm
p86
aVof science, the remaining large majority of
p87
aVbasic applied scientists, including a large portion of those who could be
p88
aVsaid to be of the first rank, are the ones who map the terrain, they scout
p89
aVthe frontiers, they cut the pathways,
p90
aVthey raise the buildings along the way.
p91
aa(lp92
VSome may have considered me foolhardy,
p93
aVbut it's been my habit to brush aside the fear of mathematics
p94
aVwhen talking to candidate scientists.
p95
aVDuring 41 years of teaching biology at Harvard,
p96
aVI watched sadly as bright students turned away
p97
aVfrom the possibility of a scientific career
p98
aVor even from taking non-required courses in science
p99
aVbecause they were afraid of failure.
p100
aVThese math-phobes deprive science and medicine
p101
aVof immeasurable amounts of badly needed talent.
p102
aa(lp103
VHere's how to relax your anxieties, if you have them:
p104
aVUnderstand that mathematics is a language
p105
aVruled like other verbal languages,
p106
aVor like verbal language generally, by its own grammar
p107
aVand system of logic.
p108
aVAny person with average quantitative intelligence
p109
aVwho learns to read and write mathematics
p110
aVat an elementary level will, as in verbal language, have little difficulty
p111
aVpicking up most of the fundamentals
p112
aVif they choose to master the mathspeak of most disciplines of science.
p113
aa(lp114
VThe longer you wait to become at least semi-literate
p115
aVthe harder the language of mathematics will be to master, just as again in any verbal
p116
aVlanguage, but it can be done at any age.
p117
aVI speak as an authority
p118
aVon that subject, because I'm an extreme case.
p119
aVI didn't take algebra until my freshman year
p120
aVat the University of Alabama.
p121
aVThey didn't teach it before then.
p122
aa(lp123
VI finally got around to calculus as a 32-year-old tenured professor at Harvard,
p124
aVwhere I sat uncomfortably in classes with undergraduate students,
p125
aVlittle more than half my age.
p126
aVA couple of them were students
p127
aVin a course I was giving on evolutionary biology.
p128
aVI swallowed my pride, and I learned calculus.
p129
aa(lp130
VI found out that in science and all its applications,
p131
aVwhat is crucial is not that technical ability,
p132
aVbut it is imagination in all of its applications.
p133
aVThe ability to form concepts with images of entities and processes
p134
aVpictured by intuition.
p135
aVI found out that advances in science rarely come upstream
p136
aVfrom an ability to stand at a blackboard
p137
aVand conjure images from unfolding mathematical propositions
p138
aVand equations.
p139
aVThey are instead the products of downstream imagination leading to hard work,
p140
aVduring which mathematical reasoning may or may not prove to be relevant.
p141
aVIdeas emerge when a part of the real or imagined world is studied
p142
aVfor its own sake.
p143
aa(lp144
VOf foremost importance is a thorough, well-organized knowledge
p145
aVof all that is known of the relevant entities and processes that might be involved in that domain
p146
aVyou propose to enter.
p147
aVWhen something new is discovered,
p148
aVit's logical then that one of the follow-up steps is
p149
aVto find the mathematical and statistical methods to move its analysis forward.
p150
aVIf that step proves too difficult for
p151
aVthe person or team that made the discovery,
p152
aVa mathematician can then be added by them
p153
aVas a collaborator.
p154
aa(lp155
VConsider the following principle,
p156
aVwhich I will modestly call Wilson's Principle Number One:
p157
aVIt is far easier for scientists
p158
aVincluding medical researchers, to require needed collaboration
p159
aVin mathematics and statistics
p160
aVthan it is for mathematicians and statisticians
p161
aVto find scientists able to make use of their equations.
p162
aVIt is important in choosing the direction to take in science
p163
aVto find the subject at your level of competence that interests you deeply,
p164
aVand focus on that.
p165
aa(lp166
VKeep in mind, then, Wilson's Second Principle:
p167
aVFor every scientist, whether researcher, technician,
p168
aVteacher, manager or businessman,
p169
aVworking at any level of mathematical competence,
p170
aVthere exists a discipline in science or medicine
p171
aVfor which that level is enough to achieve excellence.
p172
aa(lp173
VNow I'm going to offer quickly
p174
aVseveral more principles that will be useful
p175
aVin organizing your education and career,
p176
aVor if you're teaching, how you might
p177
aVenhance your own teaching and counseling of young scientists.
p178
aVIn selecting a subject in which to conduct original research,
p179
aVor to develop world-class expertise,
p180
aVtake a part of the chosen discipline that is sparsely inhabited.
p181
aVJudge opportunity by how few other students and researchers
p182
aVare on hand.
p183
aa(lp184
VThis is not to de-emphasize the essential requirement
p185
aVof broad training, or the value of apprenticing yourself
p186
aVin ongoing research to programs of high quality.
p187
aVIt is important also to acquire older mentors within these successful
p188
aVprograms, and to make friends and colleagues of your age
p189
aVfor mutual support.
p190
aVBut through it all, look for a way to break out,
p191
aVto find a field and subject not yet popular.
p192
aa(lp193
VWe have seen this demonstrated already in the talks preceding mine.
p194
aVThere is the quickest way advances are likely to occur,
p195
aVas measured in discoveries per investigator per year.
p196
aVYou may have heard the
p197
aVmilitary dictum for the gathering of armies:
p198
aVMarch to the sound of the guns.
p199
aVIn science, the exact opposite is the case: March away from the sound of the guns.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo Wilson's Principle Number Three:
p202
aVMarch away from the sound of the guns.
p203
aVObserve from a distance,
p204
aVbut do not join the fray.
p205
aVMake a fray of your own.
p206
aVOnce you have settled on a specialty,
p207
aVand the profession you can love, and you've secured opportunity,
p208
aVyour potential to succeed will be greatly enhanced if you study it
p209
aVenough to become an expert.
p210
aa(lp211
VThere are thousands of professionally delimited
p212
aVsubjects sprinkled through physics and chemistry
p213
aVto biology and medicine.
p214
aVAnd on then into the social sciences,
p215
aVwhere it is possible in short time to acquire
p216
aVthe status of an authority.
p217
aVWhen the subject is still very thinly populated,
p218
aVyou can with diligence and hard work become
p219
aVthe world authority.
p220
aa(lp221
VThe world needs this kind of expertise,
p222
aVand it rewards the kind of people
p223
aVwilling to acquire it.
p224
aVThe existing information and what you self-discover
p225
aVmay at first seem skimpy and difficult to connect
p226
aVto other bodies of knowledge.
p227
aVWell, if that's the case,
p228
aVgood. Why hard instead of easy?
p229
aa(lp230
VThe answer deserves to be stated as Principle Number Four.
p231
aVIn the attempt to make scientific discoveries,
p232
aVevery problem is an opportunity,
p233
aVand the more difficult the problem,
p234
aVthe greater will be the importance of its solution.
p235
aa(lp236
VNow this brings me to a basic categorization
p237
aVin the way scientific discoveries are made.
p238
aVScientists, pure mathematicians among them,
p239
aVfollow one or the other of two pathways:
p240
aVFirst through early discoveries,
p241
aVa problem is identified
p242
aVand a solution is sought.
p243
aVThe problem may be relatively small;
p244
aVfor example, where exactly in a cruise ship does the norovirus begin to spread?
p245
aVOr larger, what's the role of dark matter in the expansion of the universe?
p246
aVAs the answer is sought, other phenomena are typically discovered
p247
aVand other questions are asked.
p248
aa(lp249
VThis first of the two strategies is like a hunter,
p250
aVexploring a forest in search of a particular quarry,
p251
aVwho finds other quarries along the way.
p252
aVThe second strategy of research
p253
aVis to study a subject broadly
p254
aVsearching for unknown phenomena or patterns of known phenomena
p255
aVlike a hunter in what we call "the naturalist's trance,"
p256
aVthe researcher of mind is open to anything interesting,
p257
aVany quarry worth taking.
p258
aVThe search is not for the solution of the problem,
p259
aVbut for problems themselves worth solving.
p260
aa(lp261
VThe two strategies of research,
p262
aVoriginal research, can be stated as follows,
p263
aVin the final principle I'm going to offer you:
p264
aVFor every problem in a given discipline of science,
p265
aVthere exists a species or entity or phenomenon
p266
aVideal for its solution.
p267
aVAnd conversely, for every species or other entity
p268
aVor phenomenon, there exist important problems
p269
aVfor the solution of which, those particular objects of research are ideally suited.
p270
aVFind out what they are.
p271
aVYou'll find your own way to discover,
p272
aVto learn, to teach.
p273
aa(lp274
VThe decades ahead will see dramatic advances
p275
aVin disease prevention, general health, the quality of life.
p276
aVAll of humanity depends on the knowledge and practice of the medicine and the science
p277
aVbehind it you will master.
p278
aVYou have chosen a calling that will come in steps
p279
aVto give you satisfaction, at its conclusion, of a life well lived.
p280
aVAnd I thank you for having me here tonight.
p281
aa(lp282
V(Applause)
p283
aa(lp284
VOh, thank you.
p285
aVThank you very much.
p286
aVI salute you.

VWell, we all need a reason to wake up.
p5
aVFor me, it just took 11,000 volts.
p6
aa(lp7
VI know you're too polite to ask,
p8
aVso I will tell you.
p9
aa(lp10
VOne night, sophomore year of college,
p11
aVjust back from Thanksgiving holiday,
p12
aVa few of my friends and I were horsing around,
p13
aVand we decided to climb atop a parked commuter train.
p14
aVIt was just sitting there, with the wires that run overhead.
p15
aVSomehow, that seemed like a great idea at the time.
p16
aVWe'd certainly done stupider things.
p17
aVI scurried up the ladder on the back,
p18
aVand when I stood up,
p19
aVthe electrical current entered my arm,
p20
aVblew down and out my feet, and that was that.
p21
aVWould you believe that watch still works?
p22
aVTakes a licking!
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VMy father wears it now in solidarity.
p27
aa(lp28
VThat night began my formal relationship with death \u2014 my death \u2014
p29
aVand it also began my long run as a patient.
p30
aVIt's a good word.
p31
aVIt means one who suffers.
p32
aVSo I guess we're all patients.
p33
aa(lp34
VNow, the American health care system
p35
aVhas more than its fair share of dysfunction \u2014
p36
aVto match its brilliance, to be sure.
p37
aVI'm a physician now, a hospice and palliative medicine doc,
p38
aVso I've seen care from both sides.
p39
aVAnd believe me: almost everyone who goes into healthcare
p40
aVreally means well \u2014 I mean, truly.
p41
aVBut we who work in it are also unwitting agents
p42
aVfor a system that too often does not serve.
p43
aa(lp44
VWhy?
p45
aVWell, there's actually a pretty easy answer to that question,
p46
aVand it explains a lot:
p47
aVbecause healthcare was designed with diseases, not people, at its center.
p48
aVWhich is to say, of course, it was badly designed.
p49
aVAnd nowhere are the effects of bad design more heartbreaking
p50
aVor the opportunity for good design more compelling
p51
aVthan at the end of life,
p52
aVwhere things are so distilled and concentrated.
p53
aVThere are no do-overs.
p54
aa(lp55
VMy purpose today is to reach out across disciplines
p56
aVand invite design thinking into this big conversation.
p57
aVThat is, to bring intention and creativity
p58
aVto the experience of dying.
p59
aVWe have a monumental opportunity in front of us,
p60
aVbefore one of the few universal issues
p61
aVas individuals as well as a civil society:
p62
aVto rethink and redesign how it is we die.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo let's begin at the end.
p65
aVFor most people, the scariest thing about death isn't being dead,
p66
aVit's dying, suffering.
p67
aVIt's a key distinction.
p68
aVTo get underneath this, it can be very helpful
p69
aVto tease out suffering which is necessary as it is,
p70
aVfrom suffering we can change.
p71
aVThe former is a natural, essential part of life, part of the deal,
p72
aVand to this we are called to make space, adjust, grow.
p73
aVIt can be really good to realize forces larger than ourselves.
p74
aVThey bring proportionality,
p75
aVlike a cosmic right-sizing.
p76
aVAfter my limbs were gone,
p77
aVthat loss, for example, became fact, fixed \u2014
p78
aVnecessarily part of my life,
p79
aVand I learned that I could no more reject this fact than reject myself.
p80
aVIt took me a while, but I learned it eventually.
p81
aVNow, another great thing about necessary suffering
p82
aVis that it is the very thing
p83
aVthat unites caregiver and care receiver \u2014
p84
aVhuman beings.
p85
aVThis, we are finally realizing, is where healing happens.
p86
aVYes, compassion \u2014 literally, as we learned yesterday \u2014
p87
aVsuffering together.
p88
aa(lp89
VNow, on the systems side, on the other hand,
p90
aVso much of the suffering is unnecessary, invented.
p91
aVIt serves no good purpose.
p92
aVBut the good news is, since this brand of suffering is made up,
p93
aVwell, we can change it.
p94
aVHow we die is indeed something we can affect.
p95
aVMaking the system sensitive to this fundamental distinction
p96
aVbetween necessary and unnecessary suffering
p97
aVgives us our first of three design cues for the day.
p98
aVAfter all, our role as caregivers, as people who care,
p99
aVis to relieve suffering \u2014 not add to the pile.
p100
aa(lp101
VTrue to the tenets of palliative care,
p102
aVI function as something of a reflective advocate,
p103
aVas much as prescribing physician.
p104
aVQuick aside: palliative care \u2014 a very important field but poorly understood \u2014
p105
aVwhile it includes, it is not limited to end of life care.
p106
aVIt is not limited to hospice.
p107
aVIt's simply about comfort and living well at any stage.
p108
aVSo please know that you don't have to be dying anytime soon
p109
aVto benefit from palliative care.
p110
aa(lp111
VNow, let me introduce you to Frank.
p112
aVSort of makes this point.
p113
aVI've been seeing Frank now for years.
p114
aVHe's living with advancing prostate cancer on top of long-standing HIV.
p115
aVWe work on his bone pain and his fatigue,
p116
aVbut most of the time we spend thinking out loud together about his life \u2014
p117
aVreally, about our lives.
p118
aVIn this way, Frank grieves.
p119
aVIn this way, he keeps up with his losses as they roll in,
p120
aVso that he's ready to take in the next moment.
p121
aVLoss is one thing, but regret, quite another.
p122
aVFrank has always been an adventurer \u2014
p123
aVhe looks like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting \u2014
p124
aVand no fan of regret.
p125
aVSo it wasn't surprising when he came into clinic one day,
p126
aVsaying he wanted to raft down the Colorado River.
p127
aVWas this a good idea?
p128
aVWith all the risks to his safety and his health, some would say no.
p129
aVMany did, but he went for it, while he still could.
p130
aVIt was a glorious, marvelous trip:
p131
aVfreezing water, blistering dry heat, scorpions, snakes,
p132
aVwildlife howling off the flaming walls of the Grand Canyon \u2014
p133
aVall the glorious side of the world beyond our control.
p134
aVFrank's decision, while maybe dramatic,
p135
aVis exactly the kind so many of us would make,
p136
aVif we only had the support to figure out what is best for ourselves over time.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo much of what we're talking about today is a shift in perspective.
p139
aVAfter my accident, when I went back to college,
p140
aVI changed my major to art history.
p141
aVStudying visual art, I figured I'd learn something about how to see \u2014
p142
aVa really potent lesson for a kid who couldn't change
p143
aVso much of what he was seeing.
p144
aVPerspective, that kind of alchemy we humans get to play with,
p145
aVturning anguish into a flower.
p146
aa(lp147
VFlash forward: now I work at an amazing place in San Francisco
p148
aVcalled the Zen Hospice Project,
p149
aVwhere we have a little ritual that helps with this shift in perspective.
p150
aVWhen one of our residents dies,
p151
aVthe mortuary men come, and as we're wheeling the body out through the garden,
p152
aVheading for the gate, we pause.
p153
aVAnyone who wants \u2014
p154
aVfellow residents, family, nurses, volunteers,
p155
aVthe hearse drivers too, now \u2014
p156
aVshares a story or a song or silence,
p157
aVas we sprinkle the body with flower petals.
p158
aVIt takes a few minutes;
p159
aVit's a sweet, simple parting image to usher in grief with warmth,
p160
aVrather than repugnance.
p161
aVContrast that with the typical experience in the hospital setting,
p162
aVmuch like this \u2014 floodlit room lined with tubes and beeping machines
p163
aVand blinking lights that don't stop even when the patient's life has.
p164
aVCleaning crew swoops in, the body's whisked away,
p165
aVand it all feels as though that person had never really existed.
p166
aVWell-intended, of course, in the name of sterility,
p167
aVbut hospitals tend to assault our senses,
p168
aVand the most we might hope for within those walls is numbness \u2014
p169
aVanesthetic, literally the opposite of aesthetic.
p170
aVI revere hospitals for what they can do; I am alive because of them.
p171
aVBut we ask too much of our hospitals.
p172
aVThey are places for acute trauma and treatable illness.
p173
aVThey are no place to live and die; that's not what they were designed for.
p174
aa(lp175
VNow mind you \u2014 I am not giving up on the notion
p176
aVthat our institutions can become more humane.
p177
aVBeauty can be found anywhere.
p178
aVI spent a few months in a burn unit
p179
aVat St. Barnabas Hospital in Livingston, New Jersey,
p180
aVwhere I got really great care at every turn,
p181
aVincluding good palliative care for my pain.
p182
aVAnd one night, it began to snow outside.
p183
aVI remember my nurses complaining about driving through it.
p184
aVAnd there was no window in my room,
p185
aVbut it was great to just imagine it coming down all sticky.
p186
aVNext day, one of my nurses smuggled in a snowball for me.
p187
aVShe brought it in to the unit.
p188
aVI cannot tell you the rapture I felt holding that in my hand,
p189
aVand the coldness dripping onto my burning skin;
p190
aVthe miracle of it all,
p191
aVthe fascination as I watched it melt and turn into water.
p192
aVIn that moment,
p193
aVjust being any part of this planet in this universe mattered more to me
p194
aVthan whether I lived or died.
p195
aVThat little snowball packed all the inspiration I needed
p196
aVto both try to live and be OK if I did not.
p197
aVIn a hospital, that's a stolen moment.
p198
aa(lp199
VIn my work over the years, I've known many people
p200
aVwho were ready to go, ready to die.
p201
aVNot because they had found some final peace or transcendence,
p202
aVbut because they were so repulsed by what their lives had become \u2014
p203
aVin a word, cut off, or ugly.
p204
aVThere are already record numbers of us living with chronic and terminal illness,
p205
aVand into ever older age.
p206
aVAnd we are nowhere near ready or prepared for this silver tsunami.
p207
aVWe need an infrastructure dynamic enough to handle
p208
aVthese seismic shifts in our population.
p209
aVNow is the time to create something new, something vital.
p210
aVI know we can because we have to.
p211
aVThe alternative is just unacceptable.
p212
aVAnd the key ingredients are known:
p213
aVpolicy, education and training,
p214
aVsystems, bricks and mortar.
p215
aVWe have tons of input for designers of all stripes to work with.
p216
aa(lp217
VWe know, for example, from research
p218
aVwhat's most important to people who are closer to death:
p219
aVcomfort; feeling unburdened and unburdening to those they love;
p220
aVexistential peace; and a sense of wonderment and spirituality.
p221
aa(lp222
VOver Zen Hospice's nearly 30 years,
p223
aVwe've learned much more from our residents in subtle detail.
p224
aVLittle things aren't so little.
p225
aVTake Janette.
p226
aVShe finds it harder to breathe one day to the next due to ALS.
p227
aVWell, guess what?
p228
aVShe wants to start smoking again \u2014
p229
aVand French cigarettes, if you please.
p230
aVNot out of some self-destructive bent,
p231
aVbut to feel her lungs filled while she has them.
p232
aVPriorities change.
p233
aVOr Kate \u2014 she just wants to know
p234
aVher dog Austin is lying at the foot of her bed,
p235
aVhis cold muzzle against her dry skin,
p236
aVinstead of more chemotherapy coursing through her veins \u2014
p237
aVshe's done that.
p238
aVSensuous, aesthetic gratification, where in a moment, in an instant,
p239
aVwe are rewarded for just being.
p240
aVSo much of it comes down to loving our time by way of the senses,
p241
aVby way of the body \u2014 the very thing doing the living and the dying.
p242
aa(lp243
VProbably the most poignant room
p244
aVin the Zen Hospice guest house is our kitchen,
p245
aVwhich is a little strange when you realize
p246
aVthat so many of our residents can eat very little, if anything at all.
p247
aVBut we realize we are providing sustenance on several levels:
p248
aVsmell, a symbolic plane.
p249
aVSeriously, with all the heavy-duty stuff happening under our roof,
p250
aVone of the most tried and true interventions we know of,
p251
aVis to bake cookies.
p252
aVAs long as we have our senses \u2014
p253
aVeven just one \u2014
p254
aVwe have at least the possibility of accessing
p255
aVwhat makes us feel human, connected.
p256
aVImagine the ripples of this notion
p257
aVfor the millions of people living and dying with dementia.
p258
aVPrimal sensorial delights that say the things we don't have words for,
p259
aVimpulses that make us stay present \u2014
p260
aVno need for a past or a future.
p261
aa(lp262
VSo, if teasing unnecessary suffering out of the system was our first design cue,
p263
aVthen tending to dignity by way of the senses,
p264
aVby way of the body \u2014 the aesthetic realm \u2014
p265
aVis design cue number two.
p266
aVNow this gets us quickly to the third and final bit for today;
p267
aVnamely, we need to lift our sights, to set our sights on well-being,
p268
aVso that life and health and healthcare
p269
aVcan become about making life more wonderful,
p270
aVrather than just less horrible.
p271
aVBeneficence.
p272
aa(lp273
VHere, this gets right at the distinction
p274
aVbetween a disease-centered and a patient- or human-centered model of care,
p275
aVand here is where caring becomes a creative, generative,
p276
aVeven playful act.
p277
aV"Play" may sound like a funny word here.
p278
aVBut it is also one of our highest forms of adaptation.
p279
aVConsider every major compulsory effort it takes to be human.
p280
aVThe need for food has birthed cuisine.
p281
aVThe need for shelter has given rise to architecture.
p282
aVThe need for cover, fashion.
p283
aVAnd for being subjected to the clock,
p284
aVwell, we invented music.
p285
aVSo, since dying is a necessary part of life,
p286
aVwhat might we create with this fact?
p287
aVBy "play" I am in no way suggesting we take a light approach to dying
p288
aVor that we mandate any particular way of dying.
p289
aVThere are mountains of sorrow that cannot move,
p290
aVand one way or another, we will all kneel there.
p291
aVRather, I am asking that we make space \u2014
p292
aVphysical, psychic room, to allow life to play itself all the way out \u2014
p293
aVso that rather than just getting out of the way,
p294
aVaging and dying can become a process of crescendo through to the end.
p295
aVWe can't solve for death.
p296
aVI know some of you are working on this.
p297
aa(lp298
V(Laughter)
p299
aa(lp300
VMeanwhile, we can \u2014
p301
aa(lp302
V(Laughter)
p303
aa(lp304
VWe can design towards it.
p305
aVParts of me died early on,
p306
aVand that's something we can all say one way or another.
p307
aVI got to redesign my life around this fact,
p308
aVand I tell you it has been a liberation
p309
aVto realize you can always find a shock of beauty or meaning
p310
aVin what life you have left,
p311
aVlike that snowball lasting for a perfect moment,
p312
aVall the while melting away.
p313
aVIf we love such moments ferociously,
p314
aVthen maybe we can learn to live well \u2014
p315
aVnot in spite of death,
p316
aVbut because of it.
p317
aVLet death be what takes us,
p318
aVnot lack of imagination.
p319
aa(lp320
VThank you.
p321
aa(lp322

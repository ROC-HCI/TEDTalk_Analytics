VTo be new at TED \u2014 it's like being the last high-school virgin.
p5
aV(Laughter)
p6
aVYou know that all of the cool people are \u2014 they're doing it.
p7
aVAnd you're on the outside, you're at home.
p8
aVYou're like the Raspyni Brothers,
p9
aVwhere you've got your balls in cold water. And \u2014
p10
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p11
aVyou just play with your fingers all day. And then you get invited.
p12
aVAnd you're on the inside, and it's everything you hoped it would be.
p13
aVIt's exciting and there's music playing all of the time
p14
aVand then suddenly it's over. And it's only taken five minutes.
p15
aVAnd you want to go back and do it again.
p16
aVBut I really appreciate being here. And thank you, Chris,
p17
aVand also, thank you, Deborah Patton, for making this possible.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo anyway, today we'll talk about architecture a little bit,
p20
aVwithin the subject of creation and optimism.
p21
aVAnd if you put creation and optimism together,
p22
aVyou've got two choices that you can talk about.
p23
aVYou can talk about creationism \u2014
p24
aVwhich I think wouldn't go down well with this audience,
p25
aVat least not from a view where you were a proponent of it \u2014
p26
aVor you can talk about optimisations, spelled the British way, with an S, instead of a Z.
p27
aVAnd I think that's what I'd like to talk about today.
p28
aVBut any kind of conversation about architecture \u2014
p29
aVwhich is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here,
p30
aVsetting up TED, small-scale architecture \u2014
p31
aVat the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this,
p32
aVthe World Trade Center, and what's been going on there, what it means to us.
p33
aa(lp34
VBecause if architecture is what I believe it to be,
p35
aVwhich is the built form of our cultural ambitions,
p36
aVwhat do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation
p37
aVthat represents somebody else's cultural ambitions relative to us?
p38
aVAnd our own opportunity to make something new there?
p39
aVThis has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time.
p40
aVI think that the World Trade Center in, rather an unfortunate way,
p41
aVbrought architecture into focus
p42
aVin a way that I don't think people had thought of in a long time,
p43
aVand made it a subject for common conversation.
p44
aVI don't remember, in my 20-year career of practicing and writing about architecture,
p45
aVa time when five people sat me down at a table
p46
aVand asked me very serious questions about zoning, fire exiting,
p47
aVsafety concerns and whether carpet burns.
p48
aVThese are just not things we talked about very often.
p49
aVAnd yet, now, it's talked about all the time.
p50
aVAt the point where you can weaponize your buildings,
p51
aVyou have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way.
p52
aVAnd so now we're going to think about architecture in a very different way,
p53
aVwe're going to think about it like this.
p54
aa(lp55
VHow many of you saw USA Today, today? There it is. Looks like that.
p56
aVThere's the World Trade Center site, on the front cover.
p57
aVThey've made a selection.
p58
aVThey've chosen a project by Daniel Libeskind,
p59
aVthe enfant terrible of the moment of architecture.
p60
aVChild-prodigy piano player, he started on the squeezebox,
p61
aVand moved to a little more serious issue, a bigger instrument,
p62
aVand now to an even larger instrument,
p63
aVupon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic,
p64
aVas you see here.
p65
aVHe was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition,
p66
aVafter six previous firms struck out
p67
aVwith things that were so stupid and banal
p68
aVthat even the city of New York was forced to go,
p69
aV"Oh, I'm really sorry, we screwed up."
p70
aVRight. Can we do this again from the top,
p71
aVexcept use some people with a vague hint of talent,
p72
aVinstead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time,
p73
aVreal estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities.
p74
aVLet's bring in some real architects for a change.
p75
aVAnd so we got this, or we had a choice of that. Oh, stop clapping.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VIt's too late. That is gone.
p80
aVThis was a scheme by a team called THINK, a New York-based team,
p81
aVand then there was that one, which was the Libeskind scheme.
p82
aVThis one, this is going to be the new World Trade Center:
p83
aVa giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it.
p84
aVNow, I don't know what you think, but I think this is a pretty stupid decision,
p85
aVbecause what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction
p86
aVby making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever.
p87
aVBut that's what we're going to do.
p88
aVBut I want you to think about these things
p89
aVin terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents,
p90
aVand that these two things talk about very specifically.
p91
aVAnd that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects,
p92
aVin trying to decide whether we want architecture
p93
aVfrom the kind of technocratic solution to everything \u2014
p94
aVthat there is a large, technical answer that can solve all problems,
p95
aVbe they social, be they physical, be they chemical \u2014
p96
aVor something that's more of a romantic solution.
p97
aa(lp98
VNow, I don't mean romantic as in, this is a nice place to take someone on a date.
p99
aVI mean romantic in the sense of, there are things larger and grander than us.
p100
aVSo, in the American tradition,
p101
aVthe difference between the technocratic and the romantic,
p102
aVwould be the difference between Thomas Jefferson's
p103
aVCartesian grids spreading across the United States,
p104
aVthat gives us basically the whole shape
p105
aVof every western state in the United States,
p106
aVas a really, truly, technocratic solution, a bowing to the \u2014
p107
aVin Jefferson's time \u2014 current, popular philosophy of rationalism.
p108
aVOr the way we went to describe that later: manifest destiny.
p109
aVNow, which would you rather be? A grid, or manifest destiny?
p110
aVManifest destiny.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VIt's a big deal. It sounds big, it sounds important,
p115
aVit sounds solid. It sounds American. Ballsy, serious, male.
p116
aVAnd that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time.
p117
aVI mean, it goes on in our private lives, too, every single day.
p118
aVWe all want to go out and buy an Audi TT, don't we?
p119
aVEveryone here must own one, or at least they craved one
p120
aVthe moment they saw one.
p121
aVAnd then they hopped in it, turned the little electronic key,
p122
aVrather than the real key, zipped home on their new superhighway,
p123
aVand drove straight into a garage that looks like a Tudor castle.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VWhy? Why? Why do you want to do that?
p128
aVWhy do we all want to do that? I even owned a Tudor thing once myself.
p129
aa(lp130
V(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
VIt's in our nature to go ricocheting
p133
aVback and forth between this technocratic solution
p134
aVand a larger, sort of more romantic image of where we are.
p135
aVSo we're going to go straight into this.
p136
aVCan I have the lights off for a moment?
p137
aVI'm going to talk about two architects very, very briefly
p138
aVthat represent the current split, architecturally,
p139
aVbetween these two traditions of a technocratic
p140
aVor technological solution and a romantic solution.
p141
aVAnd these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today.
p142
aVOne very young, one a little more mature.
p143
aVThis is the work of a firm called SHoP,
p144
aVand what you're seeing here, is their isometric drawings
p145
aVof what will be a large-scale camera obscura in a public park.
p146
aVDoes everybody know what a camera obscura is?
p147
aVYeah, it's one of those giant camera lenses
p148
aVthat takes a picture of the outside world \u2014
p149
aVit's sort of a little movie, without any moving parts \u2014
p150
aVand projects it on a page, and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it.
p151
aa(lp152
VThis is just the outline of it, and you can see,
p153
aVdoes it look like a regular building? No.
p154
aVIt's actually non-orthogonal: it's not up and down,
p155
aVsquare, rectangular, anything like that,
p156
aVthat you'd see in a normal shape of a building.
p157
aVThe computer revolution, the technocratic, technological revolution,
p158
aVhas allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings,
p159
aVtraditionally shaped buildings, in favor of non-orthogonal buildings such as this.
p160
aVWhat's interesting about it is not the shape.
p161
aVWhat's interesting about it is how it's made. How it's made.
p162
aVA brand-new way to put buildings together,
p163
aVsomething called mass customization. No, it is not an oxymoron.
p164
aVWhat makes the building expensive, in the traditional sense,
p165
aVis making individual parts custom, that you can't do over and over again.
p166
aVThat's why we all live in developer houses.
p167
aVThey all want to save money by building the same thing 500 times.
p168
aVThat's because it's cheaper.
p169
aa(lp170
VMass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer,
p171
aVa program that says, manufacture these parts.
p172
aVThe computer then talks to a machine \u2014
p173
aVa computer-operated machine, a cad-cam machine \u2014
p174
aVthat can make a zillion different changes, at a moment's notice,
p175
aVbecause the computer is just a machine.
p176
aVIt doesn't care. It's manufacturing the parts.
p177
aVIt doesn't see any excess cost. It doesn't spend any extra time.
p178
aVIt's not a laborer \u2014 it's simply an electronic lathe,
p179
aVso the parts can all be cut at the same time.
p180
aVMeanwhile, instead of sending someone working drawings,
p181
aVwhich are those huge sets of blueprints that you've seen your whole life,
p182
aVwhat the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions,
p183
aVlike you used to get when you were a child,
p184
aVwhen you bought little models that said, "Bolt A to B, and C to D."
p185
aVAnd so what the builder will get is every single individual part
p186
aVthat has been custom manufactured off-site and delivered on a truck
p187
aVto the site, to that builder, and a set of these instruction manuals.
p188
aVJust simple "Bolt A to B" and they will be able to put them together.
p189
aVHere's the little drawing that tells them how that works \u2014
p190
aVand that's what will happen in the end.
p191
aa(lp192
VYou're underneath it, looking up into the lens of the camera obscura.
p193
aVLest you think this is all fiction, lest you think this is all fantasy, or romance,
p194
aVthese same architects were asked to produce something
p195
aVfor the central courtyard of PS1, which is a museum in Brooklyn, New York,
p196
aVas part of their young architects summer series.
p197
aVAnd they said, well, it's summer, what do you do?
p198
aVIn the summer, you go to the beach.
p199
aVAnd when you go to the beach, what do you get? You get sand dunes.
p200
aVSo let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana.
p201
aVSo they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune.
p202
aVThey took photographs, they fed the photographs into their computer program,
p203
aVand that computer program shaped a sand dune
p204
aVand then took that sand dune shape and turned it into \u2014
p205
aVat their instructions, using standard software with slight modifications \u2014
p206
aVa set of instructions for pieces of wood.
p207
aVAnd those are the pieces of wood. Those are the instructions.
p208
aVThese are the pieces, and here's a little of that blown up.
p209
aa(lp210
VWhat you can see is there's about six different colors,
p211
aVand each color represents a type of wood to be cut, a piece of wood to be cut.
p212
aVAll of which were delivered by flat bed, on a truck,
p213
aVand hand assembled in 48 hours by a team of eight people,
p214
aVonly one of whom had ever seen the plans before.
p215
aVOnly one of whom had ever seen the plans before.
p216
aVAnd here comes dune-scape, coming up out of the courtyard,
p217
aVand there it is fully built.
p218
aVThere are only 16 different pieces of wood,
p219
aVonly 16 different assembly parts here.
p220
aVLooks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside.
p221
aVIt has its own built-in swimming pool, very, very cool.
p222
aVIt's a great place for parties \u2014 it was, it was only up for six weeks.
p223
aVIt's got little dressing rooms and cabanas,
p224
aVwhere lots of interesting things went on, all summer long.
p225
aa(lp226
VNow, lest you think that this is only for the light at heart, or just temporary installations,
p227
aVthis is the same firm working at the World Trade Center,
p228
aVreplacing the bridge that used to go across West Street,
p229
aVthat very important pedestrian connection
p230
aVbetween the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West Side.
p231
aVThey were asked to design, replace that bridge in six weeks,
p232
aVbuilding it, including all of the parts, manufactured.
p233
aVAnd they were able to do it. That was their design,
p234
aVusing that same computer modeling system
p235
aVand only five or six really different kinds of parts,
p236
aVa couple of struts, like this, some exterior cladding material
p237
aVand a very simple framing system
p238
aVthat was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck.
p239
aVThey were able to create that.
p240
aVThey were able to create something wonderful.
p241
aVThey're now building a 16-story building on the side of New York,
p242
aVusing the same technology.
p243
aVHere we're going to walk across the bridge at night.
p244
aVIt's self-lit, you don't need any overhead lighting,
p245
aVso the neighbors don't complain about metal-halide lighting in their face.
p246
aVHere it is going across. And there, down the other side,
p247
aVand you get the same kind of grandeur.
p248
aa(lp249
VNow, let me show you, quickly, the opposite, if I may.
p250
aVWoo, pretty, huh. This is the other side of the coin.
p251
aVThis is the work of David Rockwell from New York City,
p252
aVwhose work you can see out here today.
p253
aVThe current king of the romantics, who approaches his work
p254
aVin a very different fashion.
p255
aVIt's not to create a technological solution, it's to seduce you
p256
aVinto something that you can do, into something that will please you,
p257
aVsomething that will lift your spirits,
p258
aVsomething that will make you feel as if are in another world \u2014
p259
aVsuch as his Nobu restaurant in New York,
p260
aVwhich is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York City
p261
aVto the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition.
p262
aV"When it's all said and done, it's got to look like seaweed," said the owner.
p263
aVOr his restaurant, Pod, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
p264
aa(lp265
VI want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white.
p266
aVEvery single surface of this restaurant is white.
p267
aVThe reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting.
p268
aVIt's all about sensuality. It's all about transforming.
p269
aVWatch this \u2014 I'm not touching any buttons, ladies and gentlemen.
p270
aVThis is happening by itself.
p271
aVIt transforms through the magic of lighting.
p272
aVIt's all about sensuality. It's all about touch.
p273
aVRosa Mexicano restaurant, where he transports us to the shores of Acapulco,
p274
aVup on the Upper West Side,
p275
aVwith this wall of cliff divers who \u2014 there you go, like that.
p276
aVLet's see it one more time.
p277
aVOkay, just to make sure that you've enjoyed it.
p278
aVAnd finally, it's about comfort, it's about making you feel good
p279
aVin places that you wouldn't have felt good before.
p280
aVIt's about bringing nature to the inside.
p281
aa(lp282
VIn the Guardian Tower of New York, converted to a W Union Square \u2014
p283
aVI'm sorry I'm rushing \u2014 where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world
p284
aVto make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space
p285
aVof the court garden of the Union Square into the building itself.
p286
aVIt's about stimulation.
p287
aVThis is a wine-buying experience simplified by color and taste.
p288
aVFizzy, fresh, soft, luscious, juicy, smooth, big and sweet wines,
p289
aVall explained to you by color and texture on the wall.
p290
aVAnd finally, it's about entertainment, as in his headquarters
p291
aVfor the Cirque du Soleil, Orlando, Florida,
p292
aVwhere you're asked to enter the Greek theater,
p293
aVlook under the tent and join the magic world of Cirque du Soleil.
p294
aVAnd I think I'll probably leave it at that. Thank you very much.

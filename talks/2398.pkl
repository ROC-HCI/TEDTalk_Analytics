VIn 2008, Burhan Hassan, age 17,
p5
aVboarded a flight from Minneapolis
p6
aVto the Horn of Africa.
p7
aVAnd while Burhan was the youngest recruit,
p8
aVhe was not alone.
p9
aVAl-Shabaab managed to recruit over two dozen young men
p10
aVin their late teens and early 20s
p11
aVwith a heavy presence on social media platforms like Facebook.
p12
aVWith the Internet and other technologies,
p13
aVthey've changed our everyday lives,
p14
aVbut they've also changed recruitment, radicalization
p15
aVand the front lines of conflict today.
p16
aa(lp17
VWhat about the links connecting Twitter,
p18
aVGoogle and protesters fighting for democracy?
p19
aVThese numbers represent Google's public DNS servers,
p20
aVeffectively the only digital border crossing
p21
aVprotesters had and could use
p22
aVto communicate with each other, to reach the outside world
p23
aVand to spread viral awareness
p24
aVof what was happening in their own country.
p25
aa(lp26
VToday, conflict is essentially borderless.
p27
aVIf there are bounds to conflict today,
p28
aVthey're bound by digital, not physical geography.
p29
aVAnd under all this is a vacuum of power
p30
aVwhere non-state actors, individuals and private organizations
p31
aVhave the advantage over slow, outdated military and intelligence agencies.
p32
aVAnd this is because, in the digital age of conflict,
p33
aVthere exists a feedback loop
p34
aVwhere new technologies, platforms like the ones I mentioned,
p35
aVand more disruptive ones,
p36
aVcan be adapted, learned, and deployed by individuals and organizations
p37
aVfaster than governments can react.
p38
aa(lp39
VTo understand the pace of our own government thinking on this,
p40
aVI like to turn to something aptly named
p41
aVthe Worldwide Threat Assessment,
p42
aVwhere every year the Director of National Intelligence in the US
p43
aVlooks at the global threat landscape,
p44
aVand he says, "These are the threats, these are the details,
p45
aVand this is how we rank them."
p46
aVIn 2007, there was absolutely no mention of cyber security.
p47
aVIt took until 2011, when it came at the end,
p48
aVwhere other things, like West African drug trafficking, took precedence.
p49
aVIn 2012, it crept up, still behind things like terrorism and proliferation.
p50
aVIn 2013, it became the top threat,
p51
aVin 2014 and for the foreseeable future.
p52
aa(lp53
VWhat things like that show us
p54
aVis that there is a fundamental inability today
p55
aVon the part of governments to adapt and learn in digital conflict,
p56
aVwhere conflict can be immaterial, borderless, often wholly untraceable.
p57
aVAnd conflict isn't just online to offline, as we see with terrorist radicalization,
p58
aVbut it goes the other way as well.
p59
aa(lp60
VWe all know the horrible events that unfolded in Paris this year
p61
aVwith the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks.
p62
aVWhat an individual hacker or a small group of anonymous individuals did
p63
aVwas enter those social media conversations that so many of us took part in.
p64
aV#JeSuisCharlie.
p65
aVOn Facebook, on Twitter, on Google,
p66
aVall sorts of places where millions of people, myself included,
p67
aVwere talking about the events
p68
aVand saw images like this,
p69
aVthe emotional, poignant image of a baby with "Je suis Charlie" on its wrist.
p70
aVAnd this turned into a weapon.
p71
aVWhat the hackers did was weaponize this image,
p72
aVwhere unsuspecting victims,
p73
aVlike all of us in those conversations,
p74
aVsaw this image, downloaded it
p75
aVbut it was embedded with malware.
p76
aVAnd so when you downloaded this image,
p77
aVit hacked your system.
p78
aVIt took six days to deploy a global malware campaign.
p79
aVThe divide between physical and digital domains today
p80
aVceases to exist,
p81
aVwhere we have offline attacks like those in Paris
p82
aVappropriated for online hacks.
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd it goes the other way as well, with recruitment.
p85
aVWe see online radicalization of teens,
p86
aVwho can then be deployed globally for offline terrorist attacks.
p87
aa(lp88
VWith all of this, we see that there's a new 21st century battle brewing,
p89
aVand governments don't necessarily take a part.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo in another case, Anonymous vs. Los Zetas.
p92
aVIn early September 2011 in Mexico,
p93
aVLos Zetas, one of the most powerful drug cartels,
p94
aVhung two bloggers with a sign that said,
p95
aV"This is what will happen to all Internet busybodies."
p96
aVA week later, they beheaded a young girl.
p97
aVThey severed her head, put it on top of her computer
p98
aVwith a similar note.
p99
aVAnd taking the digital counteroffensive
p100
aVbecause governments couldn't even understand what was going on or act,
p101
aVAnonymous, a group we might not associate as the most positive force in the world,
p102
aVtook action,
p103
aVnot in cyber attacks, but threatening information to be free.
p104
aVOn social media, they said,
p105
aV"We will release information
p106
aVthat ties prosecutors and governors to corrupt drug deals with the cartel."
p107
aVAnd escalating that conflict,
p108
aVLos Zetas said, "We will kill 10 people for every bit of information you release."
p109
aVAnd so it ended there because it would become too gruesome to continue.
p110
aVBut what was powerful about this
p111
aVwas that anonymous individuals,
p112
aVnot federal policia, not military, not politicians,
p113
aVcould strike fear deep into the heart
p114
aVof one of the most powerful, violent organizations in the world.
p115
aVAnd so we live in an era
p116
aVthat lacks the clarity of the past in conflict,
p117
aVin who we're fighting, in the motivations behind attacks,
p118
aVin the tools and techniques used,
p119
aVand how quickly they evolve.
p120
aVAnd the question still remains:
p121
aVwhat can individuals, organizations and governments do?
p122
aa(lp123
VFor answers to these questions, it starts with individuals,
p124
aVand I think peer-to-peer security is the answer.
p125
aVThose people in relationships that bought over teens online,
p126
aVwe can do that with peer-to-peer security.
p127
aVIndividuals have more power than ever before
p128
aVto affect national and international security.
p129
aVAnd we can create those positive peer-to-peer relationships
p130
aVon and offline,
p131
aVwe can support and educate the next generation of hackers, like myself,
p132
aVinstead of saying, "You can either be a criminal or join the NSA."
p133
aVThat matters today.
p134
aVAnd it's not just individuals \u2014 it's organizations, corporations even.
p135
aVThey have an advantage to act across more borders,
p136
aVmore effectively and more rapidly than governments can,
p137
aVand there's a set of real incentives there.
p138
aVIt's profitable and valuable
p139
aVto be seen as trustworthy in the digital age,
p140
aVand will only be more so in future generations to come.
p141
aa(lp142
VBut we still can't ignore government,
p143
aVbecause that's who we turn to for collective action
p144
aVto keep us safe and secure.
p145
aVBut we see where that's gotten us so far,
p146
aVwhere there's an inability to adapt and learn in digital conflict,
p147
aVwhere at the highest levels of leadership,
p148
aVthe Director of the CIA, Secretary of Defense,
p149
aVthey say, "Cyber Pearl Harbor will happen." "Cyber 9/11 is imminent."
p150
aVBut this only makes us more fearful, not more secure.
p151
aVBy banning encryption in favor of mass surveillance and mass hacking,
p152
aVsure, GCHQ and the NSA can spy on you.
p153
aVBut that doesn't mean that they're the only ones that can.
p154
aVCapabilities are cheap, even free.
p155
aVTechnical ability is rising around the world,
p156
aVand individuals and small groups have the advantage.
p157
aVSo today it might just be the NSA and GCHQ,
p158
aVbut who's to say that the Chinese can't find that backdoor?
p159
aVOr in another generation, some kid in his basement in Estonia?
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd so I would say that it's not what governments can do,
p162
aVit's that they can't.
p163
aVGovernments today need to give up power and control
p164
aVin order to help make us more secure.
p165
aVGiving up mass surveillance and hacking and instead fixing those backdoors
p166
aVmeans that, yeah, they can't spy on us,
p167
aVbut neither can the Chinese
p168
aVor that hacker in Estonia a generation from now.
p169
aVAnd government support for technologies like Tor and Bitcoin
p170
aVmean giving up control,
p171
aVbut it means that developers, translators, anybody with an Internet connection,
p172
aVin countries like Cuba, Iran and China, can sell their skills, their products,
p173
aVin the global marketplace,
p174
aVbut more importantly sell their ideas,
p175
aVshow us what's happening in their own countries.
p176
aa(lp177
VAnd so it should be not fearful,
p178
aVit should be inspiring to the same governments
p179
aVthat fought for civil rights, free speech and democracy
p180
aVin the great wars of the last century,
p181
aVthat today, for the first time in human history,
p182
aVwe have a technical opportunity
p183
aVto make billions of people safer around the world
p184
aVthat we've never had before in human history.
p185
aVIt should be inspiring.

VI had brain surgery 18 years ago,
p5
aVand since that time, brain science has become
p6
aVa personal passion of mine.
p7
aVI'm actually an engineer.
p8
aVAnd first let me say, I recently joined
p9
aVGoogle's Moonshot group,
p10
aVwhere I had a division,
p11
aVthe display division in Google X,
p12
aVand the brain science work I'm speaking about today
p13
aVis work I did before I joined Google
p14
aVand on the side outside of Google.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo that said, there's a stigma
p17
aVwhen you have brain surgery.
p18
aVAre you still smart or not?
p19
aVAnd if not, can you make yourself smart again?
p20
aa(lp21
VAfter my neurosurgery,
p22
aVpart of my brain was missing,
p23
aVand I had to deal with that.
p24
aVIt wasn't the grey matter, but it  was the gooey part dead center
p25
aVthat makes key hormones and neurotransmitters.
p26
aVImmediately after my surgery,
p27
aVI had to decide what amounts of each of over
p28
aVa dozen powerful chemicals to take each day,
p29
aVbecause if I just took nothing,
p30
aVI would die within hours.
p31
aVEvery day now for 18 years \u2014 every single day \u2014
p32
aVI've had to try to decide the combinations
p33
aVand mixtures of chemicals,
p34
aVand try to get them, to stay alive.
p35
aVThere have been several close calls.
p36
aa(lp37
VBut luckily, I'm an experimentalist at heart,
p38
aVso I decided I would experiment
p39
aVto try to find more optimal dosages
p40
aVbecause there really isn't a clear road map
p41
aVon this that's detailed.
p42
aVI began to try different mixtures,
p43
aVand I was blown away by how
p44
aVtiny changes in dosages
p45
aVdramatically changed my sense of self,
p46
aVmy sense of who I was, my thinking,
p47
aVmy behavior towards people.
p48
aVOne particularly dramatic case:
p49
aVfor a couple months I actually tried dosages
p50
aVand chemicals typical of a man in his early 20s,
p51
aVand I was blown away by how my thoughts changed.
p52
aV(Laughter)
p53
aVI was angry all the time,
p54
aVI thought about sex constantly,
p55
aVand I thought I was the smartest person
p56
aVin the entire world, and
p57
aV\u2014(Laughter)\u2014
p58
aVof course over the years I'd met guys kind of like that,
p59
aVor maybe kind of toned-down versions of that.
p60
aVI was kind of extreme.
p61
aVBut to me, the surprise was,
p62
aVI wasn't trying to be arrogant.
p63
aVI was actually trying,
p64
aVwith a little bit of insecurity,
p65
aVto actually fix a problem in front of me,
p66
aVand it just didn't come out that way.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo I couldn't handle it.
p69
aVI changed my dosages.
p70
aVBut that experience, I think, gave me
p71
aVa new appreciation for men
p72
aVand what they might walk through,
p73
aVand I've gotten along with men
p74
aVa lot better since then.
p75
aa(lp76
VWhat I was trying to do
p77
aVwith tuning these hormones
p78
aVand neurotransmitters and so forth
p79
aVwas to try to get my intelligence back
p80
aVafter my illness and surgery,
p81
aVmy creative thought, my idea flow.
p82
aVAnd I think mostly in images,
p83
aVand so for me that became a key metric \u2014
p84
aVhow to get these mental images
p85
aVthat I use as a way of rapid prototyping,
p86
aVif you will, my ideas,
p87
aVtrying on different new ideas for size,
p88
aVplaying out scenarios.
p89
aVThis kind of thinking isn't new.
p90
aVPhiliosophers like Hume and Descartes and Hobbes
p91
aVsaw things similarly.
p92
aVThey thought that mental images and ideas
p93
aVwere actually the same thing.
p94
aVThere are those today that dispute that,
p95
aVand lots of debates about how the mind works,
p96
aVbut for me it's simple:
p97
aVMental images, for most of us,
p98
aVare central in inventive and creative thinking.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo after several years,
p101
aVI tuned myself up and I have lots of great,
p102
aVreally vivid mental images with a lot of sophistication
p103
aVand the analytical backbone behind them.
p104
aVAnd so now I'm working on,
p105
aVhow can I get these mental images in my mind
p106
aVout to my computer screen faster?
p107
aVCan you imagine, if you will,
p108
aVa movie director being able to use
p109
aVher imagination alone to direct the world in front of her?
p110
aVOr a musician to get the music out of his head?
p111
aVThere are incredible possibilities with this
p112
aVas a way for creative people
p113
aVto share at light speed.
p114
aVAnd the truth is, the remaining bottleneck
p115
aVin being able to do this
p116
aVis just upping the resolution of brain scan systems.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo let me show you why I think  we're pretty close to getting there
p119
aVby sharing with you two recent experiments
p120
aVfrom two top neuroscience groups.
p121
aVBoth used fMRI technology \u2014
p122
aVfunctional magnetic resonance imaging technology \u2014
p123
aVto image the brain,
p124
aVand here is a brain scan set from Giorgio Ganis
p125
aVand his colleagues at Harvard.
p126
aVAnd the left-hand column shows a brain scan
p127
aVof a person looking at an image.
p128
aVThe middle column shows the brainscan
p129
aVof that same individual
p130
aVimagining, seeing that same image.
p131
aVAnd the right column was created
p132
aVby subtracting the middle  column from the left column,
p133
aVshowing the difference to be nearly zero.
p134
aVThis was repeated on lots of different individuals
p135
aVwith lots of different images,
p136
aValways with a similar result.
p137
aVThe difference between seeing an image
p138
aVand imagining seeing that same image
p139
aVis next to nothing.
p140
aa(lp141
VNext let me share with you one other experiment,
p142
aVthis from Jack Gallant's lab at Cal Berkeley.
p143
aVThey've been able to decode brainwaves
p144
aVinto recognizable visual fields.
p145
aVSo let me set this up for you.
p146
aVIn this experiment, individuals were shown
p147
aVhundreds of hours of YouTube videos
p148
aVwhile scans were made of their brains
p149
aVto create a large library of their brain reacting
p150
aVto video sequences.
p151
aVThen a new movie was shown with new images,
p152
aVnew people, new animals in it,
p153
aVand a new scan set was recorded.
p154
aVThe computer, using brain scan data alone,
p155
aVdecoded that new brain scan
p156
aVto show what it thought the  individual was actually seeing.
p157
aVOn the right-hand side, you see the computer's guess,
p158
aVand on the left-hand side, the presented clip.
p159
aVThis is the jaw-dropper.
p160
aVWe are so close to being able to do this.
p161
aVWe just need to up the resolution.
p162
aVAnd now remember that when you see an image
p163
aVversus when you imagine that same image,
p164
aVit creates the same brain scan.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo this was done with the highest-resolution
p167
aVbrain scan systems available today,
p168
aVand their resolution has increased really
p169
aVabout a thousandfold in the last several years.
p170
aVNext we need to increase the resolution
p171
aVanother thousandfold
p172
aVto get a deeper glimpse.
p173
aVHow do we do that?
p174
aVThere's a lot of techniques in this approach.
p175
aVOne way is to crack open your skull and put in electrodes.
p176
aVI'm not for that.
p177
aVThere's a lot of new imaging techniques
p178
aVbeing proposed, some even by me,
p179
aVbut given the recent success of MRI,
p180
aVfirst we need to ask the question,
p181
aVis it the end of the road with this technology?
p182
aVConventional wisdom says the only way
p183
aVto get higher resolution is with bigger magnets,
p184
aVbut at this point bigger magnets
p185
aVonly offer incremental resolution improvements,
p186
aVnot the thousandfold we need.
p187
aVI'm putting forward an idea:
p188
aVinstead of bigger magnets,
p189
aVlet's make better magnets.
p190
aVThere's some new technology breakthroughs
p191
aVin nanoscience
p192
aVwhen applied to magnetic structures
p193
aVthat have created a whole new class of magnets,
p194
aVand with these magnets, we can lay down
p195
aVvery fine detailed magnetic field patterns
p196
aVthroughout the brain,
p197
aVand using those, we can actually create
p198
aVholographic-like interference structures
p199
aVto get precision control over many patterns,
p200
aVas is shown here by shifting things.
p201
aVWe can create much more complicated structures
p202
aVwith slightly different arrangements,
p203
aVkind of like making Spirograph.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo why does that matter?
p206
aVA lot of effort in MRI over the years
p207
aVhas gone into making really big,
p208
aVreally huge magnets, right?
p209
aVBut yet most of the recent advances
p210
aVin resolution have actually come from
p211
aVingeniously clever encoding and decoding solutions
p212
aVin the F.M. radio frequency transmitters and receivers
p213
aVin the MRI systems.
p214
aVLet's also, instead of a uniform magnetic field,
p215
aVput down structured magnetic patterns
p216
aVin addition to the F.M. radio frequencies.
p217
aVSo by combining the magnetics patterns
p218
aVwith the patterns in the F.M. radio frequencies
p219
aVprocessing which can massively increase
p220
aVthe information that we can extract
p221
aVin a single scan.
p222
aVAnd on top of that, we can then layer
p223
aVour ever-growing knowledge  of brain structure and memory
p224
aVto create a thousandfold increase that we need.
p225
aVAnd using fMRI, we should be able to measure
p226
aVnot just oxygenated blood flow,
p227
aVbut the hormones and neurotransmitters  I've talked about
p228
aVand maybe even the direct neural activity,
p229
aVwhich is the dream.
p230
aa(lp231
VWe're going to be able to dump our ideas
p232
aVdirectly to digital media.
p233
aVCould you imagine if we could leapfrog language
p234
aVand communicate directly with human thought?
p235
aVWhat would we be capable of then?
p236
aVAnd how will we learn to deal
p237
aVwith the truths of unfiltered human thought?
p238
aVYou think the Internet was big.
p239
aVThese are huge questions.
p240
aVIt might be irresistible as a tool
p241
aVto amplify our thinking and communication skills.
p242
aVAnd indeed, this very same tool
p243
aVmay prove to lead to the cure
p244
aVfor Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
p245
aa(lp246
VWe have little option but to open this door.
p247
aVRegardless, pick a year \u2014
p248
aVwill it happen in five years or 15 years?
p249
aVIt's hard to imagine it taking much longer.
p250
aVWe need to learn how to take this step together.
p251
aa(lp252
VThank you.

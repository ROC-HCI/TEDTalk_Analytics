VI've come here today
p5
aVto talk to you about a problem.
p6
aVIt's a very simple yet devastating problem,
p7
aVone that spans the globe
p8
aVand is affecting all of us.
p9
aVThe problem is
p10
aVanonymous companies.
p11
aVIt sounds like a really dry and technical thing,
p12
aVdoesn't it?
p13
aVBut anonymous companies are making it difficult
p14
aVand sometimes impossible
p15
aVto find out
p16
aVthe actual human beings responsible
p17
aVsometimes for really terrible crimes.
p18
aVSo, why am I here talking to all of you?
p19
aVWell, I guess I am a lifelong troublemaker
p20
aVand when my parents taught my twin brother and I
p21
aVto question authority,
p22
aVI don't think they knew where it might lead.
p23
aV(Laughter)
p24
aVAnd, they probably really regretted it
p25
aVduring my stroppy teenage years when, predictably,
p26
aVI questioned their authority a lot.
p27
aVAnd a lot of my school teachers
p28
aVdidn't appreciate it much either.
p29
aVYou see, since the age of about five
p30
aVI've always asked the question, but why?
p31
aVBut why does the Earth go around the sun?
p32
aVBut why is blood red?
p33
aVBut why do I have to go to school?
p34
aVBut why do I have to respect the teachers
p35
aVand authority?
p36
aVAnd little did I realize
p37
aVthat this question would become the basis
p38
aVof everything I would do.
p39
aVAnd so it was
p40
aVin my twenties, a long time ago,
p41
aVthat one rainy Sunday afternoon in North London
p42
aVI was sitting with Simon Taylor
p43
aVand Patrick Alley
p44
aVand we were busy stuffing envelopes
p45
aVfor a mail out in the office of the campaign group
p46
aVwhere we worked at the time.
p47
aVAnd as usual, we were talking  about the world's problems.
p48
aVAnd in particular, we were talking about
p49
aVthe civil war in Cambodia.
p50
aVAnd we had talked about that  many, many times before.
p51
aVBut then suddenly we stopped
p52
aVand looked at each other
p53
aVand said, but why don't we try and change this?
p54
aVAnd from that slightly crazy question,
p55
aVover two decades
p56
aVand many campaigns later,
p57
aVincluding alerting the world
p58
aVto the problem of blood diamonds funding war,
p59
aVfrom that crazy question,
p60
aVGlobal Witness is now an 80-strong team
p61
aVof campaigners, investigators,  journalists and lawyers.
p62
aVAnd we're all driven by the same belief,
p63
aVthat change really is possible.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo, what exactly does Global Witness do?
p66
aVWe investigate, we report,
p67
aVto uncover the people really responsible
p68
aVfor funding conflict \u2014
p69
aVfor stealing millions from citizens around the world,
p70
aValso known as state looting,
p71
aVand for destroying the environment.
p72
aVAnd then we campaign hard to  change the system itself.
p73
aVAnd we're doing this because  so many of the countries
p74
aVrich in natural resources
p75
aVlike oil or diamonds or timber
p76
aVare home to some of the poorest
p77
aVand most dispossessed people on the planet.
p78
aVAnd much of this injustice
p79
aVis made possible
p80
aVby currently accepted business practices.
p81
aVAnd one of these is anonymous companies.
p82
aVNow we've come up against anonymous companies
p83
aVin lots of our investigations,
p84
aVlike in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
p85
aVwhere we exposed how secretive deals
p86
aVinvolving anonymous companies
p87
aVhad deprived the citizens
p88
aVof one of the poorest countries on the planet
p89
aVof well over a billion dollars.
p90
aVThat's twice the country's health  and education budget combined.
p91
aVOr in Liberia,
p92
aVwhere an international predatory logging company
p93
aVused front companies as it attempted to grab
p94
aVa really huge chunk of Liberia's unique forests.
p95
aVOr political corruption in Sarawak, Malaysia,
p96
aVwhich has led to the destruction  of much of its forests.
p97
aVWell, that uses anonymous companies too.
p98
aVWe secretly filmed some of the family
p99
aVof the former chief minister and a lawyer
p100
aVas they told our undercover investigator
p101
aVexactly how these dubious deals are done
p102
aVusing such companies.
p103
aVAnd the awful thing is,
p104
aVthere are so many other examples out there
p105
aVfrom all walks of life.
p106
aVThis truly is a scandal of epic proportions
p107
aVhidden in plain sight.
p108
aVWhether it's the ruthless Mexican drugs cartel,
p109
aVthe Zetas,
p110
aVwho use anonymous companies  to launder profits
p111
aVwhile their drugs-related violence
p112
aVis tearing communities apart across the Americas.
p113
aVOr the anonymous company,
p114
aVwhich bought up Americans' tax debts,
p115
aVpiled on the legal fees
p116
aVand then gave homeowners a choice:
p117
aVPay up or lose your home.
p118
aVImagine being threatened with losing your home
p119
aVsometimes over a debt of just a few hundred dollars,
p120
aVand not being able to find out
p121
aVwho you were really up against.
p122
aa(lp123
VNow anonymous companies
p124
aVare great for sanctions busting too.
p125
aVAs the Iranian government found out
p126
aVwhen, through a series of front companies,
p127
aVit owned a building in the very heart of Manhattan,
p128
aVon Fifth Avenue,
p129
aVdespite American sanctions.
p130
aVAnd Juicy Couture, home of of the velvet track suit,
p131
aVand other companies were the unwitting,
p132
aVunknowing tenants there.
p133
aVThere are just so many examples,
p134
aVthe horesemeat scandal in Europe,
p135
aVthe Italian mafia, they've used these companies
p136
aVfor decades.
p137
aVThe $100 million American Medicare fraud,
p138
aVthe supply of weapons to wars around the world
p139
aVincluding those
p140
aVin Eastern Europe in the early '90s.
p141
aVAnonymous companies
p142
aVhave even come to light
p143
aVin the recent revolution in the Ukraine.
p144
aa(lp145
VBut, for every case that we and others expose
p146
aVthere are so many more that will remain hidden away
p147
aVbecause of the current system.
p148
aVAnd it's just a simple truth
p149
aVthat some of the people responsible  for outrageous crimes,
p150
aVfor stealing from you and me
p151
aVand millions of others,
p152
aVthey are remaining faceless
p153
aVand they are escaping accountability
p154
aVand they're doing this with ease,
p155
aVand they're doing it using legal structures.
p156
aVAnd really, that is unfair.
p157
aVWell, you might well ask,
p158
aVwhat exactly is an anonymous company,
p159
aVand can I really set one up, and use it,
p160
aVwithout anyone knowing who I am?
p161
aVWell, the answer is, yes you can.
p162
aVBut if you're anything like me,
p163
aVyou'll want to see some of that for yourself,
p164
aVso let me show you.
p165
aVWell first you need to work out
p166
aVwhere you want to set it up.
p167
aVNow, at this point you might be imagining
p168
aVone of those lovely tropical island tax havens
p169
aVbut here's the thing,
p170
aVshockingly,
p171
aVmy own hometown, London,
p172
aVand indeed the U.K.,
p173
aVis one of the best places in the world
p174
aVto set up an anonymous company.
p175
aVAnd the other, even better,
p176
aVI'm afraid that's America.
p177
aVDo you know, in some states across America
p178
aVyou need less identification
p179
aVto open up a company
p180
aVthan you do to get a library card,
p181
aVlike Delaware,
p182
aVwhich is one of the easiest places
p183
aVin the world to set up an anonymous company.
p184
aa(lp185
VOkay, so let's say it's America,
p186
aVand let's say it's Delaware,
p187
aVand now you can simply go online
p188
aVand find yourself a company service provider.
p189
aVThese are the companies that  can set your one up for you,
p190
aVand remember, it's all legal, routine business practice.
p191
aVSo, here's one,
p192
aVbut there are plenty of others to choose from.
p193
aVAnd having made your choice,
p194
aVyou then pick what type of company you want
p195
aVand then fill in a contact, name and address.
p196
aVBut don't worry,
p197
aVit doesn't have to be your name.
p198
aVIt can be your lawyer's
p199
aVor your service provider's,
p200
aVand it's not for the public record anyway.
p201
aVAnd then you add the owner of the company.
p202
aVNow this is the key part,
p203
aVand again it doesn't have to be you,
p204
aVbecause you can get creative,
p205
aVbecause there is a whole universe  out there of nominees
p206
aVto choose from.
p207
aVAnd nominees are the people that you
p208
aVcan legally pay to be your company's owner.
p209
aVAnd if you don't want to involve anyone else,
p210
aVit doesn't even have to be an actual human being.
p211
aVIt could be another company.
p212
aVAnd then finally,
p213
aVgive your company a name
p214
aVadd a few more details and make your payment.
p215
aVAnd then the service provider
p216
aVwill take a few hours or more to process it.
p217
aVBut there you are,
p218
aVin 10 minutes of online shopping
p219
aVyou can create yourself an anonymous company.
p220
aVAnd not only is it easy,
p221
aVreally, really easy and cheap,
p222
aVit's totally legal too.
p223
aVBut the fun doesn't have to end there,
p224
aVmaybe you want to be even more anonymous.
p225
aVWell, that's no problem either.
p226
aVYou can simply keep adding layers,
p227
aVcompanies owned by companies.
p228
aVYou can have hundreds of layers
p229
aVwith hundreds of companies spread across
p230
aVlots of different countries,
p231
aVlike a giant web,
p232
aVeach layer adds anonymity.
p233
aVEach layer makes it more difficult
p234
aVfor law enforcement and others
p235
aVto find out who the real owner is.
p236
aVBut whose interests is this all serving?
p237
aVIt might be in the interests of the company
p238
aVor a particular individual,
p239
aVbut what about all of us, the public?
p240
aVThere hasn't even been a global conversation yet
p241
aVabout whether it's okay
p242
aVto misuse companies in this way.
p243
aVAnd what does it all mean for us?
p244
aa(lp245
VWell, an example that really haunts me
p246
aVis one I came across recently.
p247
aVAnd it's that of a horrific fire
p248
aVin a nightclub in Buenos Aires
p249
aVabout a decade ago.
p250
aVIt was the night before New Year's Eve.
p251
aVThree thousand very happy revelers,
p252
aVmany of them teenagers,
p253
aVwere crammed into a space meant for 1,000.
p254
aVAnd then tragedy struck,
p255
aVa fire broke out
p256
aVplastic decorations were melting from the ceiling
p257
aVand toxic smoke filled the club.
p258
aVSo people tried to escape
p259
aVonly to find that some of the fire doors
p260
aVhad been chained shut.
p261
aVOver 200 people died.
p262
aVSeven hundred were injured trying to get out.
p263
aVAnd as the victims' families  and the city and the country
p264
aVreeled in shock,
p265
aVinvestigators tried to find out who was responsible.
p266
aVAnd as they looked for the owners of the club,
p267
aVthey found instead anonymous companies,
p268
aVand confusion surrounded the identities of those
p269
aVinvolved with the companies.
p270
aVNow ultimately, a range of people were charged
p271
aVand some went to jail.
p272
aVBut this was an awful tragedy,
p273
aVand it shouldn't have been so difficult
p274
aVjust to try and find out who was responsible
p275
aVfor those deaths.
p276
aVBecause in an age
p277
aVwhen there is so much information
p278
aVout there in the open,
p279
aVwhy should this crucial information
p280
aVabout company ownership
p281
aVstay hidden away?
p282
aVWhy should tax evaders, corrupt  government officials,
p283
aVarms traders and more,
p284
aVbe able to hide their identities from us, the public?
p285
aVWhy should this secrecy be such  an accepted business practice?
p286
aVAnonymous companies
p287
aVmight be the norm right now
p288
aVbut it wasn't always this way.
p289
aVCompanies were created
p290
aVto give people a chance to innovate
p291
aVand not have to put everything on the line.
p292
aVCompanies were created to limit financial risk,
p293
aVthey were never intended to  be used as a moral shield.
p294
aVCompanies were never intended to be anonymous,
p295
aVand they don't have to be.
p296
aa(lp297
VAnd so I come to my wish.
p298
aVMy wish is for us to know
p299
aVwho owns and controls companies
p300
aVso that they can no longer be used anonymously
p301
aVagainst the public good.
p302
aVTogether let's ignite world opinion,
p303
aVchange the law,
p304
aVand launch a new era of openness in business.
p305
aVSo what might this look like?
p306
aVWell, imagine if you could go online
p307
aVand look up the real owner of a company.
p308
aVImagine if this data were open and free,
p309
aVaccessible across borders
p310
aVfor citizens and businesses
p311
aVand law enforcement alike.
p312
aVImagine what a game changer that would be.
p313
aVSo how are we going to do this?
p314
aVWell, there is only one way.
p315
aVTogether, we have to change the law globally
p316
aVto create public registries
p317
aVwhich list the true owners of companies
p318
aVand can be accessed by all
p319
aVwith no loopholes.
p320
aVAnd yes, this is ambitious,
p321
aVbut there is momentum on this issue,
p322
aVand over the years I have seen
p323
aVthe sheer power of momentum,
p324
aVand it's just starting on this issue.
p325
aVThere is such an opportunity right now.
p326
aVAnd the TED community
p327
aVof creative and innovative thinkers and doers
p328
aVacross all of society
p329
aVcould make the crucial difference.
p330
aVYou really can make this change happen.
p331
aVNow, a simple starting point
p332
aVis the address behind me
p333
aVfor a Facebook page that you can join now
p334
aVto support the campaign and spread the word.
p335
aVIt's going to be a springboard
p336
aVfor our global campaigning.
p337
aVAnd the techies among you,
p338
aVyou could really help us create a prototype
p339
aVpublic registry
p340
aVto demonstrate what a powerful tool this could be.
p341
aVCampaign groups from around the world
p342
aVhave come together to work on this issue.
p343
aVThe U.K. government is already on board;
p344
aVit supports these public registries.
p345
aVAnd just last week,
p346
aVthe European Parliament came on board
p347
aVwith a vote 600 to 30 in favor of public registries.
p348
aVThat is momentum.
p349
aV(Applause)
p350
aVBut it's early days.
p351
aVAmerica still needs to come on board,
p352
aVas do so many other countries.
p353
aVAnd to succeed we will all together
p354
aVneed to help and push our politicians,
p355
aVbecause without that,
p356
aVreal far-reaching, world-shifting change
p357
aVjust isn't going to happen.
p358
aVBecause this isn't just about changing the law,
p359
aVthis is about starting a conversation
p360
aVabout what it's okay for companies to do,
p361
aVand in what ways is it acceptable  to use company structures.
p362
aVThis isn't just a dry policy issue.
p363
aVThis is a human issue
p364
aVwhich affects us all.
p365
aVThis is about being on the right side of history.
p366
aVGlobal citizens, innovators,  business leaders, individuals,
p367
aVwe need you.
p368
aVTogether, let's kickstart this global movement.
p369
aVLet's just do it,
p370
aVlet's end anonymous companies.
p371
aVThank you.
p372
aV(Applause)

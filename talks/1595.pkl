VSo little Billy goes to school,
p5
aVand he sits down and the teacher says,
p6
aV"What does your father do?"
p7
aVAnd little Billy says, "My father plays the piano
p8
aVin an opium den."
p9
aVSo the teacher rings up the parents, and says,
p10
aV"Very shocking story from little Billy today.
p11
aVJust heard that he claimed that you play the piano
p12
aVin an opium den."
p13
aVAnd the father says, "I'm very sorry. Yes, it's true, I lied.
p14
aVBut how can I tell an eight-year-old boy
p15
aVthat his father is a politician?" (Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VNow, as a politician myself, standing in front of you,
p18
aVor indeed, meeting any stranger anywhere in the world,
p19
aVwhen I eventually reveal the nature of my profession,
p20
aVthey look at me as though I'm somewhere between
p21
aVa snake, a monkey and an iguana,
p22
aVand through all of this, I feel, strongly,
p23
aVthat something is going wrong.
p24
aVFour hundred years of maturing democracy,
p25
aVcolleagues in Parliament who seem to me, as individuals,
p26
aVreasonably impressive, an increasingly educated,
p27
aVenergetic, informed population, and yet
p28
aVa deep, deep sense of disappointment.
p29
aVMy colleagues in Parliament include, in my new intake,
p30
aVfamily doctors, businesspeople, professors,
p31
aVdistinguished economists, historians, writers,
p32
aVarmy officers ranging from colonels down to regimental sergeant majors.
p33
aVAll of them, however, including myself, as we walk underneath
p34
aVthose strange stone gargoyles just down the road,
p35
aVfeel that we've become less than the sum of our parts,
p36
aVfeel as though we have become profoundly diminished.
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd this isn't just a problem in Britain.
p39
aVIt's a problem across the developing world,
p40
aVand in middle income countries too. In Jamaica,
p41
aVfor example \u2014 look at Jamaican members of Parliament,
p42
aVyou meet them, and they're often people who are
p43
aVRhodes Scholars, who've studied at Harvard or at Princeton,
p44
aVand yet, you go down to downtown Kingston,
p45
aVand you are looking at one of the most depressing sites
p46
aVthat you can see in any middle-income country in the world:
p47
aVa dismal, depressing landscape
p48
aVof burnt and half-abandoned buildings.
p49
aVAnd this has been true for 30 years, and the handover
p50
aVin 1979, 1980, between one Jamaican leader who was
p51
aVthe son of a Rhodes Scholar and a Q.C. to another
p52
aVwho'd done an economics doctorate at Harvard,
p53
aVover 800 people were killed in the streets
p54
aVin drug-related violence.
p55
aa(lp56
VTen years ago, however, the promise of democracy
p57
aVseemed to be extraordinary. George W. Bush stood up
p58
aVin his State of the Union address in 2003
p59
aVand said that democracy was the force that would beat
p60
aVmost of the ills of the world. He said,
p61
aVbecause democratic governments respect their own people
p62
aVand respect their neighbors, freedom will bring peace.
p63
aVDistinguished academics at the same time argued that
p64
aVdemocracies had this incredible range of side benefits.
p65
aVThey would bring prosperity, security,
p66
aVovercome sectarian violence,
p67
aVensure that states would never again harbor terrorists.
p68
aa(lp69
VSince then, what's happened?
p70
aVWell, what we've seen is the creation, in places like Iraq
p71
aVand Afghanistan, of democratic systems of government
p72
aVwhich haven't had any of those side benefits.
p73
aVIn Afghanistan, for example, we haven't just had one election
p74
aVor two elections. We've gone through three elections,
p75
aVpresidential and parliamentary. And what do we find?
p76
aVDo we find a flourishing civil society, a vigorous rule of law
p77
aVand good security? No. What we find in Afghanistan
p78
aVis a judiciary that is weak and corrupt,
p79
aVa very limited civil society which is largely ineffective,
p80
aVa media which is beginning to get onto its feet
p81
aVbut a government that's deeply unpopular,
p82
aVperceived as being deeply corrupt, and security
p83
aVthat is shocking, security that's terrible.
p84
aVIn Pakistan, in lots of sub-Saharan Africa,
p85
aVagain you can see democracy and elections are compatible
p86
aVwith corrupt governments, with states that are unstable
p87
aVand dangerous.
p88
aVAnd when I have conversations with people, I remember
p89
aVhaving a conversation, for example, in Iraq,
p90
aVwith a community that asked me
p91
aVwhether the riot we were seeing in front of us,
p92
aVthis was a huge mob ransacking a provincial council building,
p93
aVwas a sign of the new democracy.
p94
aVThe same, I felt, was true in almost every single one
p95
aVof the middle and developing countries that I went to,
p96
aVand to some extent the same is true of us.
p97
aa(lp98
VWell, what is the answer to this? Is the answer to just
p99
aVgive up on the idea of democracy?
p100
aVWell, obviously not. It would be absurd
p101
aVif we were to engage again in the kind of operations
p102
aVwe were engaged in, in Iraq and Afghanistan
p103
aVif we were to suddenly find ourselves in a situation
p104
aVin which we were imposing
p105
aVanything other than a democratic system.
p106
aVAnything else would run contrary to our values,
p107
aVit would run contrary to the wishes of the people
p108
aVon the ground, it would run contrary to our interests.
p109
aVI remember in Iraq, for example, that we went through
p110
aVa period of feeling that we should delay democracy.
p111
aVWe went through a period of feeling that the lesson learned
p112
aVfrom Bosnia was that elections held too early
p113
aVenshrined sectarian violence, enshrined extremist parties,
p114
aVso in Iraq in 2003 the decision was made,
p115
aVlet's not have elections for two years. Let's invest in
p116
aVvoter education. Let's invest in democratization.
p117
aVThe result was that I found stuck outside my office
p118
aVa huge crowd of people, this is actually a photograph
p119
aVtaken in Libya but I saw the same scene in Iraq
p120
aVof people standing outside screaming for the elections,
p121
aVand when I went out and said, "What is wrong
p122
aVwith the interim provincial council?
p123
aVWhat is wrong with the people that we have chosen?
p124
aVThere is a Sunni sheikh, there's a Shiite sheikh,
p125
aVthere's the seven \u2014 leaders of the seven major tribes,
p126
aVthere's a Christian, there's a Sabian,
p127
aVthere are female representatives, there's every political party in this council,
p128
aVwhat's wrong with the people that we chose?"
p129
aVThe answer came, "The problem isn't the people
p130
aVthat you chose. The problem is that you chose them."
p131
aVI have not met, in Afghanistan, in even the most
p132
aVremote community, anybody who does not want
p133
aVa say in who governs them.
p134
aVMost remote community, I have never met a villager
p135
aVwho does not want a vote.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo we need to acknowledge
p138
aVthat despite the dubious statistics, despite the fact that
p139
aV84 percent of people in Britain feel politics is broken,
p140
aVdespite the fact that when I was in Iraq, we did an opinion poll
p141
aVin 2003 and asked people what political systems they preferred,
p142
aVand the answer came back that
p143
aVseven percent wanted the United States,
p144
aVfive percent wanted France,
p145
aVthree percent wanted Britain,
p146
aVand nearly 40 percent wanted Dubai, which is, after all,
p147
aVnot a democratic state at all but a relatively prosperous
p148
aVminor monarchy, democracy is a thing of value
p149
aVfor which we should be fighting. But in order to do so
p150
aVwe need to get away from instrumental arguments.
p151
aVWe need to get away from saying democracy matters
p152
aVbecause of the other things it brings.
p153
aVWe need to get away from feeling, in the same way,
p154
aVhuman rights matters because of the other things it brings,
p155
aVor women's rights matters for the other things it brings.
p156
aVWhy should we get away from those arguments?
p157
aVBecause they're very dangerous. If we set about saying,
p158
aVfor example, torture is wrong because it doesn't extract
p159
aVgood information, or we say, you need women's rights
p160
aVbecause it stimulates economic growth by doubling the size of the work force,
p161
aVyou leave yourself open to the position where
p162
aVthe government of North Korea can turn around and say,
p163
aV"Well actually, we're having a lot of success extracting
p164
aVgood information with our torture at the moment,"
p165
aVor the government of Saudi Arabia to say, "Well,
p166
aVour economic growth's okay, thank you very much,
p167
aVconsiderably better than yours,
p168
aVso maybe we don't need to go ahead with this program on women's rights."
p169
aa(lp170
VThe point about democracy is not instrumental.
p171
aVIt's not about the things that it brings.
p172
aVThe point about democracy is not that it delivers
p173
aVlegitimate, effective, prosperous rule of law.
p174
aVIt's not that it guarantees peace with itself or with its neighbors.
p175
aVThe point about democracy is intrinsic.
p176
aVDemocracy matters because it reflects an idea of equality
p177
aVand an idea of liberty. It reflects an idea of dignity,
p178
aVthe dignity of the individual, the idea that each individual
p179
aVshould have an equal vote, an equal say,
p180
aVin the formation of their government.
p181
aa(lp182
VBut if we're really to make democracy vigorous again,
p183
aVif we're ready to revivify it, we need to get involved
p184
aVin a new project of the citizens and the politicians.
p185
aVDemocracy is not simply a question of structures.
p186
aVIt is a state of mind. It is an activity.
p187
aVAnd part of that activity is honesty.
p188
aVAfter I speak to you today, I'm going on a radio program
p189
aVcalled "Any Questions," and the thing you will have noticed
p190
aVabout politicians on these kinds of radio programs
p191
aVis that they never, ever say that they don't know the answer
p192
aVto a question. It doesn't matter what it is.
p193
aVIf you ask about child tax credits, the future of the penguins
p194
aVin the south Antarctic, asked to hold forth on whether or not
p195
aVthe developments in Chongqing contribute
p196
aVto sustainable development in carbon capture,
p197
aVand we will have an answer for you.
p198
aVWe need to stop that, to stop pretending to be
p199
aVomniscient beings.
p200
aVPoliticians also need to learn, occasionally, to say that
p201
aVcertain things that voters want, certain things that voters
p202
aVhave been promised, may be things
p203
aVthat we cannot deliver
p204
aVor perhaps that we feel we should not deliver.
p205
aa(lp206
VAnd the second thing we should do is understand
p207
aVthe genius of our societies.
p208
aVOur societies have never been so educated, have never
p209
aVbeen so energized, have never been so healthy,
p210
aVhave never known so much, cared so much,
p211
aVor wanted to do so much, and it is a genius of the local.
p212
aVOne of the reasons why we're moving away
p213
aVfrom banqueting halls such as the one in which we stand,
p214
aVbanqueting halls with extraordinary images on the ceiling
p215
aVof kings enthroned,
p216
aVthe entire drama played out here on this space,
p217
aVwhere the King of England had his head lopped off,
p218
aVwhy we've moved from spaces like this, thrones like that,
p219
aVtowards the town hall, is we're moving more and more
p220
aVtowards the energies of our people, and we need to tap that.
p221
aa(lp222
VThat can mean different things in different countries.
p223
aVIn Britain, it could mean looking to the French,
p224
aVlearning from the French,
p225
aVgetting directly elected mayors in place
p226
aVin a French commune system.
p227
aVIn Afghanistan, it could have meant instead of concentrating
p228
aVon the big presidential and parliamentary elections,
p229
aVwe should have done what was in the Afghan constitution
p230
aVfrom the very beginning, which is to get direct local elections going
p231
aVat a district level and elect people's provincial governors.
p232
aa(lp233
VBut for any of these things to work,
p234
aVthe honesty in language, the local democracy,
p235
aVit's not just a question of what politicians do.
p236
aVIt's a question of what the citizens do.
p237
aVFor politicians to be honest, the public needs to allow them to be honest,
p238
aVand the media, which mediates between the politicians
p239
aVand the public, needs to allow those politicians to be honest.
p240
aVIf local democracy is to flourish, it is about the active
p241
aVand informed engagement of every citizen.
p242
aa(lp243
VIn other words, if democracy is to be rebuilt,
p244
aVis to become again vigorous and vibrant,
p245
aVit is necessary not just for the public
p246
aVto learn to trust their politicians,
p247
aVbut for the politicians to learn to trust the public.
p248
aVThank you very much indeed. (Applause)

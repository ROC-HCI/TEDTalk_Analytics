VThe urban explosion
p5
aVof the last years of economic boom
p6
aValso produced dramatic marginalization,
p7
aVresulting in the explosion of slums
p8
aVin many parts of the world.
p9
aVThis polarization of enclaves of mega-wealth
p10
aVsurrounded by sectors of poverty
p11
aVand the socioeconomic inequalities they have engendered
p12
aVis really at the center of today's urban crisis.
p13
aVBut I want to begin tonight
p14
aVby suggesting that this urban crisis
p15
aVis not only economic or environmental.
p16
aVIt's particularly a cultural crisis,
p17
aVa crisis of the institutions
p18
aVunable to reimagine the stupid ways
p19
aVwhich we have been growing,
p20
aVunable to challenge the oil-hungry,
p21
aVselfish urbanization that have perpetuated
p22
aVcities based on consumption,
p23
aVfrom southern California to New York to Dubai.
p24
aVSo I just really want to share with you a reflection
p25
aVthat the future of cities today
p26
aVdepends less on buildings
p27
aVand, in fact, depends more
p28
aVon the fundamental reorganization of socioeconomic relations,
p29
aVthat the best ideas in the shaping
p30
aVof the city in the future
p31
aVwill not come from enclaves of economic power
p32
aVand abundance,
p33
aVbut in fact from sectors of conflict and scarcity
p34
aVfrom which an urgent imagination
p35
aVcan really inspire us to rethink urban growth today.
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd let me illustrate what I mean
p38
aVby understanding or engaging sites of conflict
p39
aVas harboring creativity, as I briefly introduce you
p40
aVto the Tijuana-San Diego border region,
p41
aVwhich has been the laboratory to rethink my practice as an architect.
p42
aa(lp43
VThis is the wall, the border wall,
p44
aVthat separates San Diego and Tijuana,
p45
aVLatin America and the United States,
p46
aVa physical emblem
p47
aVof exclusionary planning policies
p48
aVthat have perpetuated the division
p49
aVof communities, jurisdictions
p50
aVand resources across the world.
p51
aVIn this border region, we find
p52
aVsome of the wealthiest real estate,
p53
aVas I once found in the edges of San Diego,
p54
aVbarely 20 minutes away
p55
aVfrom some of the poorest  settlements in Latin America.
p56
aVAnd while these two cities have the same population,
p57
aVSan Diego has grown six times larger than Tijuana
p58
aVin the last decades,
p59
aVimmediately thrusting us to confront
p60
aVthe tensions and conflicts
p61
aVbetween sprawl and density,
p62
aVwhich are at the center of today's discussion
p63
aVabout environmental sustainability.
p64
aVSo I've been arguing in the last years
p65
aVthat, in fact, the slums of Tijuana can teach a lot
p66
aVto the sprawls of San Diego
p67
aVwhen it comes to socioeconomic sustainability,
p68
aVthat we should pay attention and learn
p69
aVfrom the many migrant communities
p70
aVon both sides of this border wall
p71
aVso that we can translate their informal processes
p72
aVof urbanization.
p73
aa(lp74
VWhat do I mean by the informal in this case?
p75
aVI'm really just talking about
p76
aVthe compendium of social practices of adaptation
p77
aVthat enable many of these migrant communities
p78
aVto transgress imposed political and economic recipes
p79
aVof urbanization.
p80
aVI'm talking simply about the creative intelligence
p81
aVof the bottom-up,
p82
aVwhether manifested in the slums of Tijuana
p83
aVthat build themselves, in fact, with the waste of San Diego,
p84
aVor the many migrant neighborhoods in Southern California
p85
aVthat have begun to be retrofitted with difference
p86
aVin the last decades.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo I've been interested as an artist
p89
aVin the measuring, the observation,
p90
aVof many of the trans-border informal flows
p91
aVacross this border:
p92
aVin one direction, from south to north,
p93
aVthe flow of immigrants into the United States,
p94
aVand from north to south the flow of waste
p95
aVfrom southern California into Tijuana.
p96
aVI'm referring to the recycling
p97
aVof these old post-war bungalows
p98
aVthat Mexican contractors bring to the border
p99
aVas American developers are disposing of them
p100
aVin the process of building a more inflated version
p101
aVof suburbia in the last decades.
p102
aVSo these are houses waiting to cross the border.
p103
aVNot only people cross the border here,
p104
aVbut entire chunks of one city move to the next,
p105
aVand when these houses are placed on top of these steel frames,
p106
aVthey leave the first floor to become the second
p107
aVto be in-filled with more house,
p108
aVwith a small business.
p109
aVThis layering of spaces and economies
p110
aVis very interesting to notice.
p111
aVBut not only houses, also small debris
p112
aVfrom one city, from San Diego, to Tijuana.
p113
aVProbably a lot of you have seen the rubber tires
p114
aVthat are used in the slums to build retaining walls.
p115
aVBut look at what people have done here in conditions
p116
aVof socioeconomic emergency.
p117
aVThey have figured out how to peel off the tire,
p118
aVhow to thread it and interlock it
p119
aVto construct a more efficient retaining wall.
p120
aVOr the garage doors that are brought
p121
aVfrom San Diego in trucks
p122
aVto become the new skin of emergency housing
p123
aVin many of these slums
p124
aVsurrounding the edges of Tijuana.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo while, as an architect,
p127
aVthis is a very compelling thing to witness,
p128
aVthis creative intelligence,
p129
aVI also want to keep myself in check.
p130
aVI don't want to romanticize poverty.
p131
aVI just want to suggest
p132
aVthat this informal urbanization
p133
aVis not just the image of precariousness,
p134
aVthat informality here, the informal,
p135
aVis really a set of socioeconomic and political procedures
p136
aVthat we could translate as artists,
p137
aVthat this is about a bottom-up urbanization
p138
aVthat performs.
p139
aVSee here, buildings are not important
p140
aVjust for their looks,
p141
aVbut, in fact, they are important for what they can do.
p142
aVThey truly perform as they transform through time
p143
aVand as communities negotiate
p144
aVthe spaces and boundaries and resources.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo while waste flows southbound,
p147
aVpeople go north in search of dollars,
p148
aVand most of my research has had to do
p149
aVwith the impact of immigration
p150
aVin the alteration of the homogeneity
p151
aVof many neighborhoods in the United States,
p152
aVparticularly in San Diego.
p153
aVAnd I'm talking about how this begins to suggest
p154
aVthat the future of Southern California
p155
aVdepends on the retrofitting
p156
aVof the large urbanization \u2014 I mean, on steroids \u2014
p157
aVwith the small programs,
p158
aVsocial and economic.
p159
aVI'm referring to how immigrants,
p160
aVwhen they come to these neighborhoods,
p161
aVthey begin to alter the one-dimensionality
p162
aVof parcels and properties
p163
aVinto more socially and economically complex systems,
p164
aVas they begin to plug an informal economy into a garage,
p165
aVor as they build an illegal granny flat
p166
aVto support an extended family.
p167
aVThis socioeconomic entrepreneurship
p168
aVon the ground within these neighborhoods
p169
aVreally begins to suggest ways of translating that
p170
aVinto new, inclusive and more equitable
p171
aVland use policies.
p172
aVSo many stories emerge from these dynamics
p173
aVof alteration of space,
p174
aVsuch as "the informal Buddha,"
p175
aVwhich tells the story of a small house
p176
aVthat saved itself, it did not travel to Mexico,
p177
aVbut it was retrofitted in the end
p178
aVinto a Buddhist temple,
p179
aVand in so doing,
p180
aVthis small house transforms or mutates
p181
aVfrom a singular dwelling
p182
aVinto a small, or a micro, socioeconomic
p183
aVand cultural infrastructure inside a neighborhood.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo these action neighborhoods, as I call them,
p186
aVreally become the inspiration
p187
aVto imagine other interpretations of citizenship
p188
aVthat have less to do, in fact,
p189
aVwith belonging to the nation-state,
p190
aVand more with upholding the notion of citizenship
p191
aVas a creative act
p192
aVthat reorganizes institutional protocols
p193
aVin the spaces of the city.
p194
aa(lp195
VAs an artist, I've been interested, in fact,
p196
aVin the visualization of citizenship,
p197
aVthe gathering of many anecdotes, urban stories,
p198
aVin order to narrativize the relationship
p199
aVbetween social processes and spaces.
p200
aVThis is a story of a group of teenagers
p201
aVthat one night, a few months ago,
p202
aVdecided to invade this space under the freeway
p203
aVto begin constructing their own skateboard park.
p204
aVWith shovels in hand, they started to dig.
p205
aVTwo weeks later, the police stopped them.
p206
aVThey barricaded the place,
p207
aVand the teenagers were evicted,
p208
aVand the teenagers decided to fight back,
p209
aVnot with bank cards or slogans
p210
aVbut with constructing a critical process.
p211
aVThe first thing they did was to recognize
p212
aVthe specificity of political jurisdiction
p213
aVinscribed in that empty space.
p214
aVThey found out that they had been lucky
p215
aVbecause they had not begun to dig
p216
aVunder Caltrans territoy.
p217
aVCaltrans is a state agency that governs the freeway,
p218
aVso it would have been very difficult to negotiate with them.
p219
aVThey were lucky, they said, because they began
p220
aVto dig under an arm of the freeway
p221
aVthat belongs to the local municipality.
p222
aVThey were also lucky, they said,
p223
aVbecause they began to dig in a sort of
p224
aVBermuda Triangle of jurisdiction,
p225
aVbetween port authority, airport authority,
p226
aVtwo city districts, and a review board.
p227
aVAll these red lines are the invisible
p228
aVpolitical institutions that were inscribed
p229
aVin that leftover empty space.
p230
aVWith this knowledge, these teenagers
p231
aVas skaters confronted the city.
p232
aVThey came to the city attorney's office.
p233
aVThe city attorney told them
p234
aVthat in order to continue the negotiation
p235
aVthey had to become an NGO,
p236
aVand of course they didn't know what an NGO was.
p237
aVThey had to talk to their friends in Seattle
p238
aVwho had gone through the same experience.
p239
aVAnd they began to realize the necessity
p240
aVto organize themselves even deeper
p241
aVand began to fundraise, to organize budgets,
p242
aVto really be aware of all the knowledge
p243
aVembedded in the urban code in San Diego
p244
aVso that they could begin to redefine
p245
aVthe very meaning of public space in the city,
p246
aVexpanding it to other categories.
p247
aVAt the end, the teenagers won the case
p248
aVwith that evidence, and they were able
p249
aVto construct their skateboard park
p250
aVunder that freeway.
p251
aa(lp252
VNow for many of you, this story
p253
aVmight seem trivial or naive.
p254
aVFor me as an architect, it has become
p255
aVa fundamental narrative,
p256
aVbecause it begins to teach me
p257
aVthat this micro-community
p258
aVnot only designed another category of public space
p259
aVbut they also designed the socioeconomic protocols
p260
aVthat were necessary to be inscribed in that space
p261
aVfor its long-term sustainability.
p262
aVThey also taught me
p263
aVthat similar to the migrant communities
p264
aVon both sides of the border,
p265
aVthey engaged conflict itself as a creative tool,
p266
aVbecause they had to produce a process
p267
aVthat enabled them to reorganize resources
p268
aVand the politics of the city.
p269
aVIn that act, that informal,
p270
aVbottom-up act of transgression,
p271
aVreally began to trickle up
p272
aVto transform top-down policy.
p273
aa(lp274
VNow this journey from the bottom-up
p275
aVto the transformation of the top-down
p276
aVis where I find hope today.
p277
aVAnd I'm thinking of how these modest alterations
p278
aVwith space and with policy
p279
aVin many cities in the world,
p280
aVin primarily the urgency
p281
aVof a collective imagination
p282
aVas these communities
p283
aVreimagine their own forms of governance,
p284
aVsocial organization, and infrastructure,
p285
aVreally is at the center
p286
aVof the new formation
p287
aVof democratic politics of the urban.
p288
aVIt is, in fact, this that could become the framework
p289
aVfor producing new social
p290
aVand economic justice in the city.
p291
aVI want to say this and emphasize it,
p292
aVbecause this is the only way I see
p293
aVthat can enable us to move
p294
aVfrom urbanizations of consumption
p295
aVto neighborhoods of production today.
p296
aa(lp297
VThank you.

He has looked deeply, over many years, at the Tijuana-San Diego area spanning the US-Mexico border -- a thriving, high-density, high-activity zone of trade and urban relationships -- and at other southern cities. And he suggests that the modern, highly planned cities of the developed world have much to learn from these developments. The informal shops, garages and neighborhoods of a boomtown are built to maximize &quot;social flow&quot; -- because buildings are easy to put up and modify, they can respond exactly to the inhabitant&#39;s needs, connecting them to the community and the city.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>In collaboration with community-based nonprofits such as Casa Familiar, Cruz and his team also explore new visions for affordable housing, in relationship to an urban policy more inclusive of social and cultural programs for the city. In 1991, Cruz received the Rome Prize in Architecture; in 2005 he was the first recipient of the James Stirling Memorial Lecture On The City Prize.

architecture, urbanism, policy and art. He has looked deeply, over many years, at the Tijuana-San Diego area spanning the US-Mexico border -- a thriving, high-density, high-activity zone of trade and urban relationships -- and at other southern cities. And he suggests that the modern, highly planned cities of the developed world have much to learn from these developments. The informal shops, garages and neighborhoods of a boomtown are built to maximize &quot;social flow&quot; -- because buildings are easy to put up and modify, they can respond exactly to the inhabitant&#39;s needs, connecting them to the community and the city.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>In collaboration with community-based nonprofits such as Casa Familiar, Cruz and his team also explore new visions for affordable housing, in relationship to an urban policy more inclusive of social and cultural programs for the city. In 1991, Cruz received the Rome Prize in Architecture; in 2005 he was the first recipient of the James Stirling Memorial Lecture On The City Prize. Born in Guatemala, he is a professor in public culture and urbanism in the Visual Arts Department at University of California, San Diego.</p>", "slug": "teddy_cruz", "whotheyare": "Teddy Cruz looks for clues to the \\"city of the future\\" in the emerging urban areas of today.", "whatotherssay": "Where others saw poverty and decay, he saw the seeds of a vibrant social and architectural model.", "id": 1625, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/cec8c3f202624ac7007ee9d526e354662ee5c4d6_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "How architectural innovations migrate across borders", "take_action": null, "comments": 24776, "more_resources": null, "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/777284637366dd986604a9d8c25470e2bebb8f79_1600x1200.jpg", "description": "As the world\'s cities undergo explosive growth, inequality is intensifying.

VZach Kaplan: Keith and I lead a research team.
p5
aVWe investigate materials and technologies
p6
aVthat have unexpected properties. Over the last three years,
p7
aVwe found over 200 of these things, and so we looked
p8
aVback into our library and selected six we thought would be most
p9
aVsurprising for TED.
p10
aVOf these six, the first one that we're going to talk about
p11
aVis in the black envelope you're holding.
p12
aVIt comes from a company in Japan called GelTech. Now go ahead and open it up.
p13
aa(lp14
VKeith Schacht: Now be sure and take the two pieces apart.
p15
aVWhat's unexpected about this is that it's soft, but it's also a strong magnet.
p16
aVZach and I have always been fascinated
p17
aVobserving unexpected things like this.
p18
aVWe spent a long time thinking about why this is, and it's just recently that we realized:
p19
aVit's when we see something unexpected,
p20
aVit changes our understanding of the way things work.
p21
aVAs you're seeing this gel magnet for the first time,
p22
aVif you assume that all magnets had to be hard,
p23
aVthen seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding
p24
aVof the way magnets could work.
p25
aa(lp26
VZK: Now, it's important to understand what the unexpected properties are.
p27
aVBut to really think about the implications of what this makes possible,
p28
aVwe found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world.
p29
aVSo, a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors.
p30
aVIf you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material \u2014
p31
aVif a cabinet slams shut it wouldn't make a loud noise,
p32
aVand in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed.
p33
aVImagine taking the same material, but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker.
p34
aVYou know, this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those
p35
aVmetal sheets that they hang on the back of your door, in your closet,
p36
aVand you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf.
p37
aVFor me, I really love this idea.
p38
aV(Laughter)
p39
aVIf you come to my apartment and see my closet,
p40
aVI'm sure you'd figure out why: it's a mess.
p41
aa(lp42
VKS: Seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of
p43
aVapplications \u2014 it helps you see why this is significant, what the potential is.
p44
aVBut we've found that the way we present our ideas
p45
aVit makes a big difference.
p46
aa(lp47
VZK: It was like six months ago that Keith and I were out in L.A.,
p48
aVand we were at Starbucks having coffee with Roman Coppola.
p49
aVHe works on mostly music videos and commercials
p50
aVwith his company, The Directors Bureau.
p51
aVAs we were talking, Roman told us that he's kind of an inventor on the side.
p52
aVAnd we were showing him the same
p53
aVgel magnet that you're holding in your hand \u2014 and you know,
p54
aVwe shared the same ideas. And you could see it in his face:
p55
aVRoman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder;
p56
aVhe opens it up and Keith and I look in,
p57
aVand he starts showing us concepts that he's been working on.
p58
aVThese things just get him really excited. And so we're looking
p59
aVat these concepts, and we were just like, whoa, this guy's good.
p60
aVBecause the way that he presented the concept \u2014 his approach
p61
aVwas totally different than ours. He sold it to you as if it was for sale right now.
p62
aVWhen we were going in the car back to the airport,
p63
aVwe were thinking: why was this so powerful?
p64
aVAnd as we thought about it more, we realized that
p65
aVit let you fill in all the details about the experience,
p66
aVjust as if you saw it on TV. So, for TED we decided to take our favorite
p67
aVidea for the gel magnet and work with Roman and his team
p68
aVat the Directors Bureau to create a commercial for a product
p69
aVfrom the future.
p70
aa(lp71
VNarrator: Do you have a need for speed?
p72
aVInventables Water Adventures dares you to launch yourself
p73
aVon a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide
p74
aVso fast, so tall, that when you hit the bottom, it uses brakes to stop.
p75
aVAqua Rocket: coming this summer.
p76
aa(lp77
VKS: Now, we showed the concept to a few people before this,
p78
aVand they asked us, when's it coming out?
p79
aVSo I just wanted to let you know, it's not actually coming out,
p80
aVjust the concept is.
p81
aa(lp82
VZK: So now, when we dream up these concepts, it's important for us
p83
aVto make sure that they work from a technical standpoint.
p84
aVSo I just want to quickly explain how this would work.
p85
aVThis is the magnetically-levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial.
p86
aVThe gel that you're holding would be lining the bottom of the board.
p87
aVNow this is important for two reasons.
p88
aVOne: the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that, if it were
p89
aVto hit the rider in the head, it wouldn't injure him.
p90
aVIn addition, you can see from the diagram on the right,
p91
aVthe underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet.
p92
aVSo this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you're going down.
p93
aVThe force of the water rushing down, in addition to that repulsion force,
p94
aVwould make this slide go faster than any slide on the market.
p95
aVIt's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system.
p96
aVWhen you get to the very bottom of the slide \u2014
p97
aV(Laughter)
p98
aV\u2014 the rider passes through an aluminum tube.
p99
aVAnd I'm going to kick it to Keith to explain why that's important
p100
aVfrom a technical standpoint.
p101
aa(lp102
VKS: So I'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is
p103
aVa metal, it's not a magnetic material. But something unexpected
p104
aVhappens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube.
p105
aVSo we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you.
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aVNow, you see the magnet fell really slowly.
p108
aVNow, I'm not going to get into the physics of it,
p109
aVbut all you need to know is that the faster the magnet's falling,
p110
aVthe greater the stopping force.
p111
aa(lp112
VZK: Now, our next technology is actually a 10-foot pole,
p113
aVand I have it right here in my pocket.
p114
aV(Laughter)
p115
aVThere're a few different versions of it.
p116
aV(Laughter)
p117
aVKS: Some of them automatically unroll like this one.
p118
aVThey can be made to automatically roll up, or they can be made
p119
aVstable, like Zach's, to hold any position in between.
p120
aa(lp121
VZK: As we were talking to the vendor \u2014 to try to learn about
p122
aVhow you could apply these, or how they're being applied currently \u2014
p123
aVhe was telling us that, in the military they use this one
p124
aVso soldiers can keep it on their chests \u2014 very concealed \u2014
p125
aVand then, when they're out on the field, erect it as an antenna
p126
aVto clearly send signals back to the base.
p127
aVIn our brainstorms, we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal:
p128
aVso at the end of the game, you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag.
p129
aV(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VKS: Now, the interesting thing about this is,
p132
aVyou don't have to be an engineer to appreciate why
p133
aVa 10-foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting.
p134
aV(Laughter)
p135
aVSo we decided to go out onto the streets of Chicago
p136
aVand ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this.
p137
aa(lp138
VMan: I clean my ceiling fans with that and I get the spider webs
p139
aVoff my house \u2014 I do it that way.
p140
aVWoman: I'd make my very own walking stick.
p141
aVWoman: I would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree.
p142
aVWoman: An olive server.
p143
aVMan: Some type of extension pole \u2014 like what the painters use.
p144
aVWoman: I would make a spear that, when you went deep sea diving,
p145
aVyou could catch the fish really fast, and then roll it back up,
p146
aVand you could swim easier ... Yeah.
p147
aV(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VZK: Now, for our next technology we're going to do a little demonstration,
p150
aVand so we need a volunteer from the audience.
p151
aVYou sir, come on up.
p152
aV(Laughter)
p153
aVCome on up. Tell everybody your name.
p154
aa(lp155
VSteve Jurvetson: Steve.
p156
aa(lp157
VZK: It's Steve. All right Steve, now, follow me.
p158
aVWe need you to stand right in front of the TED sign.
p159
aVRight there. That's great.
p160
aVAnd hold onto this. Good luck to you.
p161
aV(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VKS: No, not yet.
p164
aV(Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
VZK: I'd just like to let you all know that this presentation
p167
aVhas been brought to you by Target.
p168
aa(lp169
VKS: Little bit \u2014 that's perfect, just perfect.
p170
aVNow, Zach, we're going to demonstrate
p171
aVa water gun fight from the future.
p172
aV(Laughter)
p173
aVSo here, come on up to the front. All right, so
p174
aVnow if you'll see here \u2014 no, no, it's OK.
p175
aVSo, describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt. Go ahead.
p176
aa(lp177
VSJ: It's cold.
p178
aa(lp179
VKS: Now the reason it's cold is that's it's not actually water loaded
p180
aVinto these squirt guns \u2014 it's a dry liquid developed by 3M.
p181
aVIt's perfectly clear, it's odorless, it's colorless.
p182
aVIt's so safe you could drink this stuff.
p183
aV(Laughter)
p184
aVAnd the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates
p185
aV25 times faster than water.
p186
aV(Laughter)
p187
aVAll right, well thanks for coming up.
p188
aV(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
VZK: Wait, wait, Steven \u2014 before you go we filled this with the dry liquid
p191
aVso during the break you can shoot your friends.
p192
aVSJ: Excellent, thank you.
p193
aa(lp194
VKS: Thanks for coming up. Let's give him a big round of applause.
p195
aV(Applause)
p196
aa(lp197
VSo what's the significance of this dry liquid?
p198
aVEarly versions of the fluid were actually used on a Cray Supercomputer.
p199
aVNow, the unexpected thing about this
p200
aVis that Zach could stand up on stage and drench
p201
aVa perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern
p202
aVthat we'd damage the electronics, that we'd get him wet,
p203
aVthat we'd hurt the books or the computers. It works because it's non-conductive.
p204
aVSo you can see here, you can immerse a whole circuit board
p205
aVin this and it wouldn't cause any damage.
p206
aVYou can circulate it to draw the heat away.
p207
aVBut today it's most widely used in office buildings \u2014
p208
aVin the sprinkler system \u2014 as a fire-suppression fluid.
p209
aVAgain, it's perfectly safe for people. It puts out the fires, doesn't hurt anything.
p210
aVBut our favorite idea for this
p211
aVwas using it in a basketball game. So during halftime,
p212
aVit could rain down on the players, cool everyone down,
p213
aVand in a matter of minutes it would dry. Wouldn't hurt the court.
p214
aa(lp215
VZK: Our next technology comes to us from a company in Japan
p216
aVcalled Sekisui Chemical. One of their R&D engineers
p217
aVwas working on a way to make plastic stiffer.
p218
aVWhile he was doing this, he noticed an unexpected thing.
p219
aVWe have a video to show you.
p220
aa(lp221
VKS: So you see there, it didn't bounce back. Now, this was
p222
aVan unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing.
p223
aVIt's technically called, "shape-retaining property."
p224
aVNow, think about your interactions with aluminum foil.
p225
aVShape-retaining is common in metal: you bend a piece of aluminum foil,
p226
aVand it holds its place. Contrast that with
p227
aVa plastic garbage can \u2014 and you can push in the sides
p228
aVand it always bounces back.
p229
aa(lp230
VZK: For example, you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist,
p231
aVbut doesn't use a buckle.
p232
aVTaking it a little further, if you wove
p233
aVthose strips together \u2014 kind of like a little basket \u2014 you could make
p234
aVa shape-retaining sheet, and then you could embed it in a cloth:
p235
aVso you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table,
p236
aVso that way on a windy day it wouldn't blow away.
p237
aVFor our next technology, it's hard to observe
p238
aVthe unexpected property by itself, because it's an ink.
p239
aVSo, we've prepared a video to show it applied to paper.
p240
aa(lp241
VKS: As this paper is bending, the resistance of the ink changes.
p242
aVSo with simple electronics, you can detect how much the page is being bent.
p243
aVNow, to think about the potential for this,
p244
aVthink of all the places ink is supplied: on business cards,
p245
aVon the back of cereal boxes, board games. Any place you use ink,
p246
aVyou could change the way you interact with it.
p247
aa(lp248
VZK: So my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book.
p249
aVThis could totally change the way that you interface with paper.
p250
aVYou see the dark line on the side and the top. As you turn the pages
p251
aVof the book, the book can actually detect what page you're on,
p252
aVbased on the curvature of the pages.
p253
aVIn addition, if you were to fold in one of the corners, then you could program
p254
aVthe book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes.
p255
aa(lp256
VKS: For our last technology, we worked again with Roman and his team
p257
aVat the Directors Bureau to develop a commercial from the future
p258
aVto explain how it works.
p259
aa(lp260
VOld Milk Carton: Oh yeah, it smells good.
p261
aVWho are you?
p262
aVNew Milk Carton: I'm New Milk.
p263
aVOMC: I used to smell like you.
p264
aVNarrator: Fresh Watch, from Inventables Dairy Farms.
p265
aVPackaging that changes color when your milk's gone off.
p266
aVDon't let milk spoil your morning.
p267
aa(lp268
VZK: Now, this technology was developed by these two guys:
p269
aVProfessor Ken Suslick and Neil Rakow, of the University of Illinois.
p270
aa(lp271
VKS: Now the way it works: there's a matrix of color dyes.
p272
aVAnd these dyes change color in response to odors.
p273
aVSo the smell of vanilla, that might change the four on the left to brown
p274
aVand the one on the right to yellow. This matrix can produce
p275
aVthousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells.
p276
aVBut like in the milk commercial, if you know what odor you want to detect,
p277
aVthen they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor.
p278
aa(lp279
VZK: Right. It was that that started a conversation with Professor Suslick and myself,
p280
aVand he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible,
p281
aVbeyond just detecting spoiled food. It's really where the significance of it lies.
p282
aVHis company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn,
p283
aVhow are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene?
p284
aVAnd he kind of comically explained that
p285
aVtime after time, what the firemen would say is:
p286
aVthey would rush to the scene of the crime; they would look around;
p287
aVif there were no dead policemen, it was OK to go.
p288
aV(Laughter)
p289
aVI mean, this is a true story. They're using policemen as canaries.
p290
aV(Laughter)
p291
aVBut more seriously, they determined that you could develop
p292
aVa device that can smell better than the humans,
p293
aVand say if it's safe for the firemen.
p294
aVIn addition, he's spun off a company from the University called ChemSensing,
p295
aVwhere they're working on medical equipment.
p296
aVSo, a patient can come in and actually blow into their device.
p297
aVBy detecting the odor of particular bacteria, or viruses,
p298
aVor even lung cancer, the dots will change and they can use
p299
aVsoftware to analyze the results.
p300
aVThis can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients.
p301
aVCurrently, they're using a method of trial and error,
p302
aVbut this could tell you precisely what disease you have.
p303
aa(lp304
VKS: So that was the six we had for you today, but I hope you're starting to see
p305
aVwhy we find these things so fascinating.
p306
aVBecause every one of these six changed our understanding
p307
aVof what was possible in the world. Prior to seeing this,
p308
aVwe would have assumed: a 10-foot pole couldn't fit in your pocket;
p309
aVsomething as inexpensive as ink couldn't sense the way paper is being bent;
p310
aVevery one of these things \u2014 and we're constantly trying to find more.
p311
aa(lp312
VZK: This is something that Keith and I really enjoy doing.
p313
aVI'm sure it's obvious to you now, but it was actually yesterday
p314
aVthat I was reminded of why. I was having a conversation
p315
aVwith Steve Jurvetson, over downstairs by the escalators,
p316
aVand he was telling me that when Chris sent out that little box,
p317
aVone of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand \u2014
p318
aVthe sand that doesn't get wet. He said that he was playing with it with his son.
p319
aVAnd you know, his son was mesmerized,
p320
aVbecause he would dunk it in the water, he would take it out
p321
aVand it was bone dry. A few weeks later, he said that his son
p322
aVwas playing with a lock of his mother's hair, and he noticed
p323
aVthat there were some drops of water on the hair.
p324
aVAnd he took the thing and he looked up to Steve and he said,
p325
aV"Look, hydrophobic string."
p326
aV(Laughter)
p327
aVI mean, after hearing that story \u2014 that really summed it up for me.
p328
aVThank you very much.
p329
aa(lp330
VKS: Thank you.
p331
aV(Applause)

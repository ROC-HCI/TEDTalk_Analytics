VPat Mitchell: What is the story of this pin?
p5
aa(lp6
VMadeleine Albright: This is "Breaking the Glass Ceiling."
p7
aa(lp8
VPM: Oh.
p9
aVThat was well chosen, I would say, for TEDWomen.
p10
aa(lp11
VMA: Most of the time I spend when I get up in the morning
p12
aVis trying to figure out what is going to happen.
p13
aVAnd none of this pin stuff would have happened
p14
aVif it hadn't been for Saddam Hussein.
p15
aVI'll tell you what happened.
p16
aVI went to the United Nations as an ambassador,
p17
aVand it was after the Gulf War,
p18
aVand I was an instructed ambassador.
p19
aVAnd the cease-fire had been translated
p20
aVinto a series of sanctions resolutions,
p21
aVand my instructions
p22
aVwere to say perfectly terrible things about Saddam Hussein constantly,
p23
aVwhich he deserved \u2014 he had invaded another country.
p24
aVAnd so all of a sudden, a poem appeared in the papers in Baghdad
p25
aVcomparing me to many things,
p26
aVbut among them an "unparalleled serpent."
p27
aVAnd so I happened to have a snake pin.
p28
aVSo I wore it when we talked about Iraq.
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aVAnd when I went out to meet the press,
p31
aVthey zeroed in, said, "Why are you wearing that snake pin?"
p32
aVI said, "Because Saddam Hussein compared me to an unparalleled serpent."
p33
aVAnd then I thought, well this is fun.
p34
aVSo I went out and I bought a lot of pins
p35
aVthat would, in fact, reflect
p36
aVwhat I thought we were going to do on any given day.
p37
aVSo that's how it all started.
p38
aa(lp39
VPM: So how large is the collection?
p40
aa(lp41
VMA: Pretty big.
p42
aVIt's now traveling.
p43
aVAt the moment it's in Indianapolis,
p44
aVbut it was at the Smithsonian.
p45
aVAnd it goes with a book that says, "Read My Pins."
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VPM: So is this a good idea.
p50
aVI remember when you were the first woman
p51
aVas Secretary of State,
p52
aVand there was a lot of conversation always
p53
aVabout what you were wearing,
p54
aVhow you looked \u2014
p55
aVthe thing that happens to a lot of women,
p56
aVespecially if they're the first in a position.
p57
aVSo how do you feel about that \u2014 the whole \u2014
p58
aa(lp59
VMA: Well, it's pretty irritating actually
p60
aVbecause nobody ever describes what a man is wearing.
p61
aVBut people did pay attention to what clothes I had.
p62
aVWhat was interesting was that,
p63
aVbefore I went up to New York as U.N. ambassador,
p64
aVI talked to Jeane Kirkpatrick, who'd been ambassador before me,
p65
aVand she said, "You've got to get rid of your professor clothes.
p66
aVGo out and look like a diplomat."
p67
aVSo that did give me a lot of opportunities to go shopping.
p68
aVBut still, there were all kinds of questions
p69
aVabout \u2014 "did you wear a hat?" "How short was your skirt?"
p70
aVAnd one of the things \u2014
p71
aVif you remember Condoleezza Rice was at some event and she wore boots,
p72
aVand she got criticized over that.
p73
aVAnd no guy ever gets criticized. But that's the least of it.
p74
aa(lp75
VPM: It is, for all of us, men and women,
p76
aVfinding our ways of defining our roles,
p77
aVand doing them in ways that make a difference in the world
p78
aVand shape the future.
p79
aVHow did you handle that balance
p80
aVbetween being the tough diplomatic
p81
aVand strong voice of this country
p82
aVto the rest of the world
p83
aVand also how you felt about yourself
p84
aVas a mother, a grandmother, nurturing ...
p85
aVand so how did you handle that?
p86
aa(lp87
VMA: Well the interesting part was I was asked
p88
aVwhat it was like to be the first woman Secretary of State
p89
aVa few minutes after I'd been named.
p90
aVAnd I said, "Well I've been a woman for 60 years,
p91
aVbut I've only been Secretary of State for a few minutes."
p92
aVSo it evolved.
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aVBut basically I love being a woman.
p95
aVAnd so what happened \u2014
p96
aVand I think there will probably be some people in the audience
p97
aVthat will identify with this \u2014
p98
aVI went to my first meeting, first at the U.N.,
p99
aVand that's when this all started,
p100
aVbecause that is a very male organization.
p101
aVAnd I'm sitting there \u2014 there are 15 members of the Security Council \u2014
p102
aVso 14 men sat there staring at me,
p103
aVand I thought \u2014 well you know how we all are.
p104
aVYou want to get the feeling of the room,
p105
aVand "do people like me?"
p106
aVand "will I really say something intelligent?"
p107
aVAnd all of a sudden I thought, "Well, wait a minute.
p108
aVI am sitting behind a sign that says 'The United States,'
p109
aVand if I don't speak today
p110
aVthen the voice of the United States will not be heard,"
p111
aVand it was the first time that I had that feeling
p112
aVthat I had to step out of myself
p113
aVin my normal, reluctant female mode
p114
aVand decide that I had to speak on behalf of our country.
p115
aVAnd so that happened more at various times,
p116
aVbut I really think that there was a great advantage in many ways
p117
aVto being a woman.
p118
aVI think we are a lot better
p119
aVat personal relationships,
p120
aVand then have the capability obviously
p121
aVof telling it like it is when it's necessary.
p122
aVBut I have to tell you, I have my youngest granddaughter,
p123
aVwhen she turned seven last year,
p124
aVsaid to her mother, my daughter,
p125
aV"So what's the big deal about Grandma Maddie being Secretary of State?
p126
aVOnly girls are Secretary of State."
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
V(Applause)
p131
aa(lp132
VPM: Because in her lifetime \u2014 MA: That would be so.
p133
aa(lp134
VPM: What a change that is.
p135
aVAs you travel now all over the world,
p136
aVwhich you do frequently,
p137
aVhow do you assess
p138
aVthis global narrative around the story of women and girls?
p139
aVWhere are we?
p140
aa(lp141
VMA: I think we're slowly changing,
p142
aVbut obviously there are whole pockets
p143
aVin countries where nothing is different.
p144
aVAnd therefore it means that we have to remember
p145
aVthat, while many of us have had huge opportunities \u2014
p146
aVand Pat, you have been a real leader in your field \u2014
p147
aVis that there are a lot of women
p148
aVthat are not capable
p149
aVof worrying and taking care of themselves
p150
aVand understanding that women have to help other women.
p151
aVAnd so what I have felt \u2014
p152
aVand I have looked at this
p153
aVfrom a national security issue \u2014
p154
aVwhen I was Secretary of State, I decided
p155
aVthat women's issues had to be central to American foreign policy,
p156
aVnot just because I'm a feminist,
p157
aVbut because I believe that societies are better off
p158
aVwhen women are politically and economically empowered,
p159
aVthat values are passed down,
p160
aVthe health situation is better,
p161
aVeducation is better,
p162
aVthere is greater economic prosperity.
p163
aVSo I think that it behooves us \u2014
p164
aVthose of us that live in various countries
p165
aVwhere we do have economic and political voice \u2014
p166
aVthat we need to help other women.
p167
aVAnd I really dedicated myself to that,
p168
aVboth at the U.N. and then as Secretary of State.
p169
aa(lp170
VPM: And did you get pushback
p171
aVfrom making that a central tenant of foreign policy?
p172
aa(lp173
VMA: From some people.
p174
aVI think that they thought that it was a soft issue.
p175
aVThe bottom line that I decided
p176
aVwas actually women's issues are the hardest issues,
p177
aVbecause they are the ones that have to do with life and death
p178
aVin so many aspects,
p179
aVand because, as I said,
p180
aVit is really central to the way that we think about things.
p181
aVNow for instance,
p182
aVsome of the wars that took place
p183
aVwhen I was in office,
p184
aVa lot of them, the women were the main victims of it.
p185
aVFor instance, when I started,
p186
aVthere were wars in the Balkans.
p187
aVThe women in Bosnia were being raped.
p188
aVWe then managed to set up a war crimes tribunal
p189
aVto deal specifically with those kinds of issues.
p190
aVAnd by the way, one of the things that I did at that stage
p191
aVwas, I had just arrived at the U.N.,
p192
aVand when I was there, there were 183 countries in the U.N.
p193
aVNow there are 192.
p194
aVBut it was one of the first times that I didn't have to cook lunch myself.
p195
aVSo I said to my assistant,
p196
aV"Invite the other women permanent representatives."
p197
aVAnd I thought when I'd get to my apartment
p198
aVthat there'd be a lot of women there.
p199
aVI get there, and there are six other women, out of 183.
p200
aVSo the countries that had women representatives
p201
aVwere Canada, Kazakhstan, Philippines,
p202
aVTrinidad Tobago, Jamaica,
p203
aVLichtenstein and me.
p204
aVSo being an American, I decided to set up a caucus.
p205
aV(Laughter)
p206
aVAnd so we set it up,
p207
aVand we called ourselves the G7.
p208
aa(lp209
V(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
VPM: Is that "Girl 7?" MA: Girl 7.
p212
aa(lp213
VAnd we lobbied
p214
aVon behalf of women's issues.
p215
aVSo we managed to get two women judges
p216
aVon this war crimes tribunal.
p217
aVAnd then what happened
p218
aVwas that they were able to declare that rape was a weapon of war,
p219
aVthat it was against humanity.
p220
aa(lp221
V(Applause)
p222
aa(lp223
VPM: So when you look around the world
p224
aVand you see that, in many cases \u2014
p225
aVcertainly in the Western world \u2014
p226
aVwomen are evolving into more leadership positions,
p227
aVand even other places
p228
aVsome barriers are being brought down,
p229
aVbut there's still so much violence,
p230
aVstill so many problems,
p231
aVand yet we hear there are more women
p232
aVat the negotiating tables.
p233
aVNow you were at those negotiating tables
p234
aVwhen they weren't, when there was maybe you \u2014
p235
aVone voice, maybe one or two others.
p236
aVDo you believe, and can you tell us why,
p237
aVthere is going to be a significant shift
p238
aVin things like violence
p239
aVand peace and conflict and resolution
p240
aVon a sustainable basis?
p241
aa(lp242
VMA: Well I do think, when there are more women,
p243
aVthat the tone of the conversation changes,
p244
aVand also the goals of the conversation change.
p245
aVBut it doesn't mean that the whole world
p246
aVwould be a lot better
p247
aVif it were totally run by women.
p248
aVIf you think that, you've forgotten high school.
p249
aV(Laughter)
p250
aVBut the bottom line
p251
aVis that there is a way,
p252
aVwhen there are more women at the table,
p253
aVthat there's an attempt
p254
aVto develop some understanding.
p255
aVSo for instance, what I did when I went to Burundi,
p256
aVwe'd got Tutsi and Hutu women together
p257
aVto talk about some of the problems
p258
aVthat had taken place in Rwanda.
p259
aVAnd so I think the capability of women
p260
aVto put themselves \u2014
p261
aVI think we're better about putting ourselves into the other guy's shoes
p262
aVand having more empathy.
p263
aVI think it helps in terms of the support
p264
aVif there are other women in the room.
p265
aa(lp266
VWhen I was Secretary of State,
p267
aVthere were only 13 other women foreign ministers.
p268
aVAnd so it was nice when one of them would show up.
p269
aVFor instance, she is now the president of Finland,
p270
aVbut Tarja Halonen was the foreign minister of Finland
p271
aVand, at a certain stage, head of the European Union.
p272
aVAnd it was really terrific.
p273
aVBecause one of the things I think you'll understand.
p274
aVWe went to a meeting,
p275
aVand the men in my delegation,
p276
aVwhen I would say, "Well I feel we should do something about this,"
p277
aVand they'd say, "What do you mean, you feel?"
p278
aVAnd so then Tarja was sitting across the table from me.
p279
aVAnd all of a sudden we were talking about arms control,
p280
aVand she said, "Well I feel we should do this."
p281
aVAnd my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden.
p282
aVBut I think it really does help
p283
aVto have a critical mass of women
p284
aVin a series of foreign policy positions.
p285
aVThe other thing that I think is really important:
p286
aVA lot of national security policy
p287
aVisn't just about foreign policy,
p288
aVbut it's about budgets, military budgets,
p289
aVand how the debts of countries work out.
p290
aVSo if you have women
p291
aVin a variety of foreign policy posts,
p292
aVthey can support each other
p293
aVwhen there are budget decisions being made in their own countries.
p294
aa(lp295
VPM: So how do we get
p296
aVthis balance we're looking for, then, in the world?
p297
aVMore women's voices at the table?
p298
aVMore men who believe
p299
aVthat the balance is best?
p300
aa(lp301
VMA: Well I think one of the things \u2014
p302
aVI'm chairman of the board of an organization
p303
aVcalled the National Democratic Institute
p304
aVthat works to support women candidates.
p305
aVI think that we need
p306
aVto help in other countries
p307
aVto train women
p308
aVto be in political office,
p309
aVto figure out how they can in fact
p310
aVdevelop political voices.
p311
aVI think we also need to be supportive
p312
aVwhen businesses are being created
p313
aVand just make sure that women help each other.
p314
aVNow I have a saying
p315
aVthat I feel very strongly about,
p316
aVbecause I am of a certain age
p317
aVwhere, when I started in my career,
p318
aVbelieve it or not, there were other women who criticized me:
p319
aV"Why aren't you in the carpool line?"
p320
aVor "Aren't your children suffering
p321
aVbecause you're not there all the time?"
p322
aVAnd I think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty.
p323
aVIn fact, I think "guilt" is every woman's middle name.
p324
aVAnd so I think what needs to happen
p325
aVis we need to help each other.
p326
aVAnd my motto is that there's a special place in hell
p327
aVfor women who don't help each other.
p328
aa(lp329
V(Applause)
p330
aa(lp331
VPM: Well Secretary Albright, I guess you'll be going to heaven.
p332
aVThank you for joining us today.
p333
aa(lp334
VMA: Thank you all. Thanks Pat.

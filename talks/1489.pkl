VOver the last two decades, India has become
p5
aVa global hub for software development
p6
aVand offshoring of back office services, as we call it,
p7
aVand what we were interested in finding out was that
p8
aVbecause of this huge industry that has started
p9
aVover the last two decades in India,
p10
aVoffshoring software development and back office services,
p11
aVthere's been a flight of white collar jobs
p12
aVfrom the developed world to India.
p13
aVWhen this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs
p14
aVto China, it has, you know, led to considerable angst
p15
aVamongst the Western populations.
p16
aa(lp17
VIn fact, if you look at polls, they show a declining
p18
aVtrend for support for free trade in the West.
p19
aVNow, the Western elites, however, have said
p20
aVthis fear is misplaced.
p21
aVFor example, if you have read \u2014 I suspect many of you
p22
aVhave done so \u2014 read the book by Thomas Friedman
p23
aVcalled "The World Is Flat," he said, basically, in his book
p24
aVthat, you know, this fear for free trade is wrong
p25
aVbecause it assumes, it's based on a mistaken assumption
p26
aVthat everything that can be invented has been invented.
p27
aVIn fact, he says, it's innovation that will keep the West
p28
aVahead of the developing world,
p29
aVwith the more sophisticated, innovative tasks being done
p30
aVin the developed world, and the less sophisticated,
p31
aVshall we say, drudge work being done
p32
aVin the developing world.
p33
aa(lp34
VNow, what we were trying to understand was,
p35
aVis this true?
p36
aVCould India become a source, or a global hub,
p37
aVof innovation, just like it's become a global hub
p38
aVfor back office services and software development?
p39
aVAnd for the last four years, my coauthor Phanish Puranam
p40
aVand I spent investigating this topic.
p41
aa(lp42
VInitially, or, you know, as people would say, you know,
p43
aVin fact the more aggressive people who are supporting
p44
aVthe Western innovative model, say,
p45
aV"Where are the Indian Googles, iPods and Viagras,
p46
aVif the Indians are so bloody smart?" (Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VSo initially, when we started our research, we went
p49
aVand met several executives, and we asked them,
p50
aV"What do you think? Will India go from being a favored
p51
aVdestination for software services and back office services
p52
aVto a destination for innovation?"
p53
aVThey laughed. They dismissed us.
p54
aVThey said, "You know what? Indians don't do innovation."
p55
aVThe more polite ones said, "Well, you know, Indians
p56
aVmake good software programmers and accountants,
p57
aVbut they can't do the creative stuff."
p58
aa(lp59
VSometimes, it took a more, took a veneer of sophistication,
p60
aVand people said, "You know, it's nothing to do with Indians.
p61
aVIt's really the rule-based, regimented education system
p62
aVin India that is responsible for killing all creativity."
p63
aVThey said, instead, if you want to see real creativity,
p64
aVgo to Silicon Valley, and look at companies
p65
aVlike Google, Microsoft, Intel.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo we started examining the R&D and innovation labs
p68
aVof Silicon Valley.
p69
aVWell, interestingly, what you find there is,
p70
aVusually you are introduced to the head of the innovation lab
p71
aVor the R&D center as they may call it,
p72
aVand more often than not, it's an Indian. (Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
VSo I immediately said, "Well, but you could not have been
p75
aVeducated in India, right?
p76
aVYou must have gotten your education here."
p77
aVIt turned out, in every single case,
p78
aVthey came out of the Indian educational system.
p79
aVSo we realized that maybe we had the wrong question,
p80
aVand the right question is, really, can Indians
p81
aVbased out of India do innovative work?
p82
aa(lp83
VSo off we went to India. We made, I think,
p84
aVabout a dozen trips to Bangalore, Mumbai, Gurgaon,
p85
aVDelhi, Hyderabad, you name it, to examine
p86
aVwhat is the level of corporate innovation in these cities.
p87
aVAnd what we found was, as we progressed in our research,
p88
aVwas, that we were asking really the wrong question.
p89
aVWhen you ask, "Where are the Indian Googles,
p90
aViPods and Viagras?" you are taking a particular perspective
p91
aVon innovation, which is innovation for end users,
p92
aVvisible innovation.
p93
aa(lp94
VInstead, innovation, if you remember, some of you
p95
aVmay have read the famous economist Schumpeter,
p96
aVhe said, "Innovation is novelty
p97
aVin how value is created and distributed."
p98
aVIt could be new products and services,
p99
aVbut it could also be new ways of producing products.
p100
aVIt could also be novel ways of organizing firms and industries.
p101
aa(lp102
VOnce you take this, there's no reason to restrict innovation,
p103
aVthe beneficiaries of innovation, just to end users.
p104
aVWhen you take this broader conceptualization of innovation,
p105
aVwhat we found was, India is well represented
p106
aVin innovation, but the innovation that is being done in India
p107
aVis of a form we did not anticipate, and what we did was
p108
aVwe called it "invisible innovation."
p109
aVAnd specifically, there are four types of invisible innovation
p110
aVthat are coming out of India.
p111
aa(lp112
VThe first type of invisible innovation out of India
p113
aVis what we call innovation for business customers,
p114
aVwhich is led by the multinational corporations,
p115
aVwhich have \u2014 in the last two decades, there have been
p116
aV750 R&D centers set up in India by multinational companies
p117
aVemploying more than 400,000 professionals.
p118
aVNow, when you consider the fact that, historically,
p119
aVthe R&D center of a multinational company
p120
aVwas always in the headquarters, or in the country of origin
p121
aVof that multinational company, to have 750 R&D centers
p122
aVof multinational corporations in India
p123
aVis truly a remarkable figure.
p124
aa(lp125
VWhen we went and talked to the people in those innovation
p126
aVcenters and asked them what are they working on,
p127
aVthey said, "We are working on global products."
p128
aVThey were not working on localizing global products
p129
aVfor India, which is the usual role of a local R&D.
p130
aVThey were working on truly global products,
p131
aVand companies like Microsoft, Google, AstraZeneca,
p132
aVGeneral Electric, Philips, have already answered
p133
aVin the affirmative the question that from their Bangalore
p134
aVand Hyderabad R&D centers they are able to produce
p135
aVproducts and services for the world.
p136
aVBut of course, as an end user, you don't see that,
p137
aVbecause you only see the name of the company,
p138
aVnot where it was developed.
p139
aa(lp140
VThe other thing we were told then was, "Yes, but, you know,
p141
aVthe kind of work that is coming out of the Indian R&D center
p142
aVcannot be compared to the kind of work that is coming out
p143
aVof the U.S. R&D centers."
p144
aVSo my coauthor Phanish Puranam, who happens to be
p145
aVone of the smartest people I know, said
p146
aVhe's going to do a study.
p147
aVWhat he did was he looked at those companies
p148
aVthat had an R&D center in USA and in India,
p149
aVand then he looked at a patent that was filed
p150
aVout of the U.S. and a similar patent filed out of the same
p151
aVcompany's subsidiary in India,
p152
aVso he's now comparing the patents of R&D centers
p153
aVin the U.S. with R&D centers in India of the same company
p154
aVto find out what is the quality of the patents filed
p155
aVout of the Indian centers and how do they compare
p156
aVwith the quality of the patents filed out of the U.S. centers?
p157
aa(lp158
VInterestingly, what he finds is
p159
aV\u2014 and by the way, the way we look at the quality of a patent
p160
aVis what we call forward citations: How many times
p161
aVdoes a future patent reference the older patent? \u2014
p162
aVhe finds something very interesting.
p163
aVWhat we find is that the data says
p164
aVthat the number of forward citations of a patent filed
p165
aVout of a U.S. R&D subsidiary is identical to the number
p166
aVof forward citations of a patent filed by an Indian subsidiary
p167
aVof the same company within that company.
p168
aVSo within the company, there's no difference in the forward
p169
aVcitation rates of their Indian subsidiaries versus
p170
aVtheir U.S. subsidiaries.
p171
aVSo that's the first kind of invisible innovation coming out of India.
p172
aa(lp173
VThe second kind of invisible innovation coming out of India
p174
aVis what we call outsourcing innovation to Indian companies,
p175
aVwhere many companies today are contracting
p176
aVIndian companies to do a major part of their product
p177
aVdevelopment work for their global products
p178
aVwhich are going to be sold to the entire world.
p179
aVFor example, in the pharma industry, a lot of the molecules
p180
aVare being developed, but you see a major part of that work
p181
aVis being sent to India.
p182
aVFor example, XCL Technologies,
p183
aVthey developed two of the mission critical systems
p184
aVfor the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner,
p185
aVone to avoid collisions in the sky,
p186
aVand another to allow landing in zero visibility.
p187
aVBut of course, when you climb onto the Boeing 787,
p188
aVyou are not going to know that this is invisible innovation
p189
aVout of India.
p190
aa(lp191
VThe third kind of invisible innovation coming out of India
p192
aVis what we call process innovations, because of an injection
p193
aVof intelligence by Indian firms.
p194
aVProcess innovation is different from product innovation.
p195
aVIt's about how do you create a new product or develop
p196
aVa new product or manufacture a new product,
p197
aVbut not a new product itself?
p198
aa(lp199
VOnly in India do millions of young people dream
p200
aVof working in a call center.
p201
aVWhat happens \u2014 You know, it's a dead end job in the West,
p202
aVwhat high school dropouts do.
p203
aVWhat happens when you put hundreds of thousands
p204
aVof smart, young, ambitious kids
p205
aVon a call center job?
p206
aVVery quickly, they get bored, and they start innovating,
p207
aVand they start telling the boss how to do this job better, and
p208
aVout of this process innovation comes product innovations,
p209
aVwhich are then marketed around the world.
p210
aa(lp211
VFor example, 24/7 Customer,
p212
aVtraditional call center company, used to be a traditional
p213
aVcall center company. Today they're developing
p214
aVanalytical tools to do predictive modeling so that before
p215
aVyou pick up the phone, you can guess
p216
aVor predict what this phone call is about.
p217
aVIt's because of an injection of intelligence into a process
p218
aVwhich was considered dead for a long time in the West.
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd the last kind of innovation, invisible innovation
p221
aVcoming out of India is what we call management innovation.
p222
aVIt's not a new product or a new process
p223
aVbut a new way to organize work,
p224
aVand the most significant management innovation to come
p225
aVout of India, invented by the Indian offshoring industry
p226
aVis what we call the global delivery model.
p227
aVWhat the global delivery model allows is, it allows you
p228
aVto take previously geographically core-located tasks,
p229
aVbreak them up into parts, send them around the world
p230
aVwhere the expertise and the cost structure exists,
p231
aVand then specify the means for reintegrating them.
p232
aVWithout that, you could not have any of the other
p233
aVinvisible innovations today.
p234
aa(lp235
VSo, what I'm trying to say is, what we are finding
p236
aVin our research is, that if products for end users
p237
aVis the visible tip of the innovation iceberg,
p238
aVIndia is well represented in the invisible, large,
p239
aVsubmerged portion of the innovation iceberg.
p240
aa(lp241
VNow, this has, of course, some implications,
p242
aVand so we developed three implications of this research.
p243
aVThe first is what we called sinking skill ladder,
p244
aVand now I'm going to go back to where I started my
p245
aVconversation with you, which was about the flight of jobs.
p246
aVNow, of course, when we first, as a multinational company,
p247
aVdecide to outsource jobs to India in the R&D,
p248
aVwhat we are going to do is we are going to outsource the
p249
aVbottom rung of the ladder to India, the least sophisticated jobs,
p250
aVjust like Tom Friedman would predict.
p251
aa(lp252
VNow, what happens is, when you outsource the bottom rung
p253
aVof the ladder to India for innovation and for R&D work,
p254
aVat some stage in the very near future you are going to have
p255
aVto confront a problem,
p256
aVwhich is where does the next step
p257
aVof the ladder people come from within your company?
p258
aVSo you have two choices then:
p259
aVEither you bring the people from India into
p260
aVthe developed world to take positions in the next step
p261
aVof the ladder \u2014 immigration \u2014
p262
aVor you say, there's so many people in the bottom step
p263
aVof the ladder waiting to take the next position in India,
p264
aVwhy don't we move the next step to India?
p265
aa(lp266
VWhat we are trying to say is
p267
aVthat once you outsource the bottom end of the ladder, you \u2014
p268
aVit's a self-perpetuating act, because of the sinking skill ladder,
p269
aVand the sinking skill ladder is simply the point that
p270
aVyou can't be an investment banker
p271
aVwithout having been an analyst once.
p272
aVYou can't be a professor without having been a student.
p273
aVYou can't be a consultant without having been a research associate.
p274
aVSo, if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs,
p275
aVat some stage, the next step of the ladder has to follow.
p276
aa(lp277
VThe second thing we bring up is what we call
p278
aVthe browning of the TMT, the top management teams.
p279
aVIf the R&D talent is going to be based out of India
p280
aVand China, and the largest growth markets
p281
aVare going to be based out of India and China,
p282
aVyou have to confront the problem that
p283
aVyour top management of the future
p284
aVis going to have to come out of India and China,
p285
aVbecause that's where the product leadership is,
p286
aVthat's where the important market leadership is.
p287
aa(lp288
VRight? And the last thing we point out in this slide,
p289
aVwhich is, you know, that to this story, there's one caveat.
p290
aVIndia has the youngest growing population in the world.
p291
aVThis demographic dividend is incredible, but paradoxically,
p292
aVthere's also the mirage of mighty labor pools.
p293
aVIndian institutes and educational system,
p294
aVwith a few exceptions, are incapable of producing students
p295
aVin the quantity and quality needed
p296
aVto keep this innovation engine going,
p297
aVso companies are finding innovative ways to overcome this,
p298
aVbut in the end it does not absolve the government
p299
aVof the responsibility for creating this educational structure.
p300
aa(lp301
VSo finally, I want to conclude
p302
aVby showing you the profile of one company, IBM.
p303
aVAs many of you know, IBM has always been considered
p304
aVfor the last hundred years to be one of the most
p305
aVinnovative companies.
p306
aVIn fact, if you look at the number of patents filed over history,
p307
aVI think they are in the top or the top two or three companies
p308
aVin the world of all patents filed in the USA as a private company.
p309
aa(lp310
VHere is the profile of employees of
p311
aVIBM over the last decade.
p312
aVIn 2003, they had 300,000 employees,
p313
aVor 330,000 employees, out of which, 135,000
p314
aVwere in America, 9,000 were in India.
p315
aVIn 2009, they had 400,000 employees, by which time
p316
aVthe U.S. employees had moved to 105,000,
p317
aVwhereas the Indian employees had gone to 100,000.
p318
aa(lp319
VWell, in 2010, they decided they're not going to reveal
p320
aVthis data anymore, so I had to make some estimates
p321
aVbased on various sources.
p322
aVHere are my best guesses. Okay? I'm not saying
p323
aVthis is the exact number, it's my best guess.
p324
aVIt gives you a sense of the trend.
p325
aVThere are 433,000 people now at IBM, out of which
p326
aV98,000 are remaining in the U.S.,
p327
aVand 150,000 are in India.
p328
aVSo you tell me, is IBM an American company,
p329
aVor an Indian company? (Laughter)
p330
aa(lp331
VLadies and gentlemen, thank you very much. (Applause)

VIf you had caught me straight out of college
p5
aVin the halls of the Vermont State House
p6
aVwhere I was a lobbyist in training
p7
aVand asked me what I was going to do with my life,
p8
aVI would have told you
p9
aVthat I'd just passed the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi,
p10
aVthe Chinese equivalency exam,
p11
aVand I was going to go study law in Beijing,
p12
aVand I was going to improve U.S.-China relations
p13
aVthrough top-down policy changes
p14
aVand judicial system reforms.
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aV(Applause)
p17
aVI had a plan,
p18
aVand I never ever thought
p19
aVit would have anything to do
p20
aVwith the banjo.
p21
aa(lp22
VLittle did I know
p23
aVwhat a huge impact it would have on me one night
p24
aVwhen I was at a party
p25
aVand I heard a sound coming out of a record player
p26
aVin the corner of a room.
p27
aVAnd it was Doc Watson
p28
aVsinging and playing "Shady Grove."
p29
aV\u266b Shady Grove, my little love \u266b
p30
aV\u266b Shady Grove, my darlin' \u266b
p31
aV\u266b Shady Grove, my little love \u266b
p32
aV\u266b Going back to Harlan \u266b
p33
aVThat sound was just so beautiful,
p34
aVthe sound of Doc's voice
p35
aVand the rippling groove of the banjo.
p36
aVAnd after being totally and completely obsessed
p37
aVwith the mammoth richness and history
p38
aVof Chinese culture,
p39
aVit was like this total relief
p40
aVto hear something so truly American
p41
aVand so truly awesome.
p42
aVI knew I had to take a banjo with me to China.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo before going to law school in China
p45
aVI bought a banjo, I threw it in my little red truck
p46
aVand I traveled down through Appalachia
p47
aVand I learned a bunch of old American songs,
p48
aVand I ended up in Kentucky
p49
aVat the International Bluegrass Music Association Convention.
p50
aVAnd I was sitting in a hallway one night
p51
aVand a couple girls came up to me.
p52
aVAnd they said, "Hey, do you want to jam?"
p53
aVAnd I was like, "Sure."
p54
aVSo I picked up my banjo
p55
aVand I nervously played four songs that I actually knew with them.
p56
aVAnd a record executive walked up to me
p57
aVand invited me to Nashville, Tennessee to make a record.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VIt's been eight years,
p62
aVand I can tell you that I didn't go to China to become a lawyer.
p63
aVIn fact, I went to Nashville.
p64
aVAnd after a few months I was writing songs.
p65
aVAnd the first song I wrote was in English,
p66
aVand the second one was in Chinese.
p67
aa(lp68
V(Music)
p69
aa(lp70
V[Chinese]
p71
aa(lp72
VOutside your door the world is waiting.
p73
aVInside your heart a voice is calling.
p74
aVThe four corners of the world are watching,
p75
aVso travel daughter, travel.
p76
aVGo get it, girl.
p77
aa(lp78
V(Applause)
p79
aa(lp80
VIt's really been eight years since that fated night in Kentucky.
p81
aVAnd I've played thousands of shows.
p82
aVAnd I've collaborated
p83
aVwith so many incredible, inspirational musicians around the world.
p84
aVAnd I see the power of music.
p85
aVI see the power of music
p86
aVto connect cultures.
p87
aVI see it when I stand on a stage
p88
aVin a bluegrass festival in east Virginia
p89
aVand I look out at the sea of lawn chairs
p90
aVand I bust out into a song in Chinese.
p91
aV[Chinese]
p92
aVAnd everybody's eyes just pop wide open
p93
aVlike it's going to fall out of their heads.
p94
aVAnd they're like, "What's that girl doing?"
p95
aVAnd then they come up to me after the show
p96
aVand they all have a story.
p97
aVThey all come up and they're like,
p98
aV"You know, my aunt's sister's babysitter's dog's chicken went to China
p99
aVand adopted a girl."
p100
aVAnd I tell you what, it like everybody's got a story.
p101
aVIt's just incredible.
p102
aVAnd then I go to China
p103
aVand I stand on a stage at a university
p104
aVand I bust out into a song in Chinese
p105
aVand everybody sings along
p106
aVand they roar with delight
p107
aVat this girl
p108
aVwith the hair and the instrument,
p109
aVand she's singing their music.
p110
aa(lp111
VAnd I see, even more importantly,
p112
aVthe power of music to connect hearts.
p113
aVLike the time I was in Sichuan Province
p114
aVand I was singing for kids in relocation schools
p115
aVin the earthquake disaster zone.
p116
aVAnd this little girl comes up to me.
p117
aV[Chinese]
p118
aV"Big sister Wong,"
p119
aVWashburn, Wong, same difference.
p120
aV"Big sister Wong, can I sing you a song
p121
aVthat my mom sang for me
p122
aVbefore she was swallowed in the earthquake?"
p123
aVAnd I sat down,
p124
aVshe sat on my lap.
p125
aVShe started singing her song.
p126
aVAnd the warmth of her body
p127
aVand the tears rolling down her rosy cheeks,
p128
aVand I started to cry.
p129
aVAnd the light that shone off of her eyes
p130
aVwas a place I could have stayed forever.
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd in that moment, we weren't our American selves,
p133
aVwe weren't our Chinese selves,
p134
aVwe were just mortals
p135
aVsitting together in that light that keeps us here.
p136
aVI want to dwell in that light
p137
aVwith you and with everyone.
p138
aVAnd I know U.S.-China relations
p139
aVdoesn't need another lawyer.
p140
aa(lp141
VThank you.
p142

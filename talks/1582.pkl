VWhat I do is I organize information.
p5
aVI'm a graphic designer.
p6
aVProfessionally, I try to make sense
p7
aVoften of things that don't make much sense themselves.
p8
aa(lp9
VSo my father might not understand what it is that I do for a living.
p10
aVHis part of my ancestry has been farmers.
p11
aVHe's part of this ethnic minority called the Pontic Greeks.
p12
aVThey lived in Asia Minor and fled to Greece after a genocide
p13
aVabout a hundred years ago.
p14
aVAnd ever since that, migration has somewhat been a theme in my family.
p15
aVMy father moved to Germany, studied there and married,
p16
aVand as a result, I now have this half-German brain,
p17
aVwith all the analytical thinking and that slightly dorky demeanor
p18
aVthat come with that.
p19
aVAnd of course it meant that I was a foreigner in both countries,
p20
aVand that of course made it pretty easy for me to migrate as well,
p21
aVin good family tradition, if you like.
p22
aa(lp23
VBut of course, most journeys that we undertake from day to day
p24
aVare within a city.
p25
aVAnd, especially if you know the city,
p26
aVgetting from A to B may seem pretty obvious, right?
p27
aVBut the question is, why is it obvious?
p28
aVHow do we know where we're going?
p29
aa(lp30
VSo I washed up on a Dublin ferry port about 12 years ago,
p31
aVa professional foreigner, if you like,
p32
aVand I'm sure you've all had this experience before, yeah?
p33
aVYou arrive in a new city,
p34
aVand your brain is trying to make sense of this new place.
p35
aVOnce you find your base, your home,
p36
aVyou start to build this cognitive map of your environment.
p37
aVIt's essentially this virtual map that only exists in your brain.
p38
aVAll animal species do it,
p39
aVeven though we all use slightly different tools.
p40
aVUs humans, of course, we don't move around marking our territory by scent, like dogs.
p41
aVWe don't run around emitting ultrasonic squeaks, like bats.
p42
aVWe just don't do that,
p43
aValthough a night in the Temple Bar district can get pretty wild.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VNo, we do two important things to make a place our own.
p48
aVFirst, we move along linear routes.
p49
aVTypically, we find a main street,
p50
aVand this main street becomes a linear strip map in our minds.
p51
aVBut our mind keeps it pretty simple, yeah?
p52
aVEvery street is generally perceived as a straight line,
p53
aVand we kind of ignore the little twists and turns that the streets make.
p54
aVWhen we do, however, make a turn into a side street,
p55
aVour mind tends to adjust that turn to a 90-degree angle.
p56
aVThis of course makes for some funny moments
p57
aVwhen you're in some old city layout
p58
aVthat follows some sort of circular city logic, yeah?
p59
aVMaybe you've had that experience as well.
p60
aa(lp61
VLet's say you're on some spot on a side street
p62
aVthat projects from a main cathedral square,
p63
aVand you want to get to another point on a side street just like that.
p64
aVThe cognitive map in your mind may tell you,
p65
aV"Aris, go back to the main cathedral square,
p66
aVtake a 90-degree turn and walk down that other side street."
p67
aVBut somehow you feel adventurous that day, and you suddenly discover
p68
aVthat the two spots were actually only a single building apart.
p69
aVNow, I don't know about you,
p70
aVbut I always feel like I find this wormhole
p71
aVor this inter-dimensional portal.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VSo we move along linear routes
p76
aVand our mind straightens streets and perceives turns as 90-degree angles.
p77
aa(lp78
VThe second thing that we do to make a place our own
p79
aVis we attach meaning and emotions to the things
p80
aVthat we see along those lines.
p81
aVIf you go to the Irish countryside and you ask an old lady for directions,
p82
aVbrace yourself for some elaborate Irish storytelling
p83
aVabout all the landmarks, yeah?
p84
aVShe'll tell you the pub where her sister used to work,
p85
aVand "... go past that church where I got married," that kind of thing.
p86
aVSo we fill our cognitive maps with these markers of meaning.
p87
aVWhat's more, we abstract repeat patterns and recognize them.
p88
aVWe recognize them by the experiences and we abstract them into symbols.
p89
aVAnd of course, we're all capable of understanding these symbols.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VWhat's more, we're all capable of understanding the cognitive maps,
p94
aVand you are all capable of creating these cognitive maps yourselves.
p95
aVSo next time, when you want to tell your friend how to get to your place,
p96
aVyou grab a beermat, grab a napkin, and you just observe yourself
p97
aVcreate this awesome piece of communication design.
p98
aVIt's got straight lines.
p99
aVIt's got 90-degree corners.
p100
aVYou might add little symbols along the way.
p101
aVAnd when you look at what you've just drawn,
p102
aVyou realize it does not resemble a street map.
p103
aVIf you were to put an actual street map on top of what you've just drawn,
p104
aVyou'd realize your streets and the distances \u2014 they'd be way off.
p105
aVNo, what you've just drawn is more like a diagram or a schematic.
p106
aVIt's a visual construct of lines, dots, letters,
p107
aVdesigned in the language of our brains.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo it's no big surprise
p110
aVthat the big information-design icon of the last century \u2014
p111
aVthe pinnacle of showing everybody how to get from A to B,
p112
aVthe London Underground map \u2014
p113
aVwas not designed by a cartographer or a city planner;
p114
aVit was designed by an engineering draftsman.
p115
aVIn the 1930s,
p116
aVHarry Beck applied the principles of schematic diagram design
p117
aVand changed the way public transport maps are designed forever.
p118
aVNow the very key to the success of this map
p119
aVis in the omission of less important information
p120
aVand in the extreme simplification.
p121
aVSo, straightened streets, corners of 90 and 45 degrees,
p122
aVbut also the extreme geographic distortion in that map.
p123
aVIf you were to look at the actual locations of these stations,
p124
aVyou'd see they're very different.
p125
aVBut this is all for the clarity of the public Tube map.
p126
aVIf you, say, wanted to get from Regent's Park station
p127
aVto Great Portland Street,
p128
aVthe Tube map would tell you:
p129
aVtake the Tube, go to Baker Street, change over, take another Tube.
p130
aVOf course, what you don't know is that the two stations
p131
aVare only about a hundred meters apart.
p132
aa(lp133
VNow we've reached the subject of public transport,
p134
aVand public transport here in Dublin
p135
aVis a somewhat touchy subject.
p136
aa(lp137
V(Laughter)
p138
aa(lp139
VFor everybody who does not know the public transport here in Dublin,
p140
aVessentially, we have this system of local buses that grew with the city.
p141
aVFor every outskirt that was added, there was another bus route added,
p142
aVrunning from the outskirt all the way to the city center.
p143
aVAnd as these local buses approach the city center,
p144
aVthey all run side by side and converge in pretty much one main street.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo when I stepped off the boat 12 years ago,
p147
aVI tried to make sense of that.
p148
aVBecause exploring a city on foot only gets you so far.
p149
aVBut when you explore a foreign and new public transport system,
p150
aVyou will build a cognitive map in your mind in pretty much the same way.
p151
aVTypically, you choose yourself a rapid transport route,
p152
aVand in your mind, this route is perceived as a straight line.
p153
aVAnd like a pearl necklace,
p154
aVall the stations and stops are nicely and neatly aligned along the line.
p155
aVAnd only then you start to discover some local bus routes
p156
aVthat would fill in the gaps,
p157
aVand that allow for those wormhole, inter-dimensional portal shortcuts.
p158
aVSo I tried to make sense, and when I arrived,
p159
aVI was looking for some information leaflets
p160
aVthat would help me crack this system and understand it,
p161
aVand I found those brochures.
p162
aa(lp163
V(Laughter)
p164
aa(lp165
VThey were not geographically distorted.
p166
aVThey had a lot of omission of information,
p167
aVbut unfortunately, the wrong information.
p168
aVSay, in the city center \u2014
p169
aVthere were never actually any lines that showed the routes.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VThere are actually not even any stations with names.
p174
aa(lp175
V(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VNow, the maps of Dublin transport have gotten better,
p178
aVand after I finished the project, they got a good bit better,
p179
aVbut still no station names, still no routes.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo, being naive, and being half-German, I decided,
p182
aV"Aris, why don't you build your own map?"
p183
aVSo that's what I did.
p184
aVI researched how each and every bus route moved through the city, nice and logical,
p185
aVevery bus route a separate line.
p186
aVI plotted it into my own map of Dublin,
p187
aVand in the city center ...
p188
aVI got a nice spaghetti plate.
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
VNow, this is a bit of a mess,
p193
aVso I decided, of course,
p194
aV"You're going to apply the rules of schematic design,"
p195
aVcleaning up the corridors,
p196
aVwidening the streets where there were loads of buses
p197
aVand making the streets at straight, 90-degree corners, 45-degree corners
p198
aVor fractions of that,
p199
aVand filled it in with the bus routes.
p200
aVAnd I built this city center bus map of the system,
p201
aVhow it was five years ago.
p202
aVI'll zoom in again so that you get the full impact
p203
aVof the quays and Westmoreland Street.
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VNow I can proudly say \u2014
p208
aa(lp209
V(Applause)
p210
aa(lp211
VI can proudly say, as a public transport map,
p212
aVthis diagram is an utter failure.
p213
aa(lp214
V(Laughter)
p215
aVExcept, probably, in one aspect:
p216
aVI now had a great visual representation
p217
aVof just how clogged up and overrun the city center really was.
p218
aa(lp219
VNow, call me old-fashioned,
p220
aVbut I think a public transport route map should have lines,
p221
aVbecause that's what they are, yeah?
p222
aVThey're little pieces of string that wrap their way
p223
aVthrough the city center or through the city.
p224
aVIf you will, the Greek guy inside of me feels if I don't get a line,
p225
aVit's like entering the labyrinth of the Minotaur
p226
aVwithout having Ariadne giving you the string to find your way.
p227
aVSo the outcome of my academic research,
p228
aVloads of questionnaires, case studies and looking at a lot of maps,
p229
aVwas that a lot of the problems and shortcomings
p230
aVof the public transport system here in Dublin
p231
aVwas the lack of a coherent public transport map \u2014
p232
aVa simplified, coherent public transport map \u2014
p233
aVbecause I think this is the crucial step to understanding
p234
aVa public transport network on a physical level,
p235
aVbut it's also the crucial step to make a public transport network mappable
p236
aVon a visual level.
p237
aa(lp238
VSo I teamed up with a gentleman called James Leahy,
p239
aVa civil engineer and a recent master's graduate
p240
aVof the Sustainable Development program at DIT,
p241
aVand together we drafted the simplified model network,
p242
aVwhich I could then go ahead and visualize.
p243
aa(lp244
VSo here's what we did.
p245
aVWe distributed these rapid-transport corridors throughout the city center,
p246
aVand extended them into the outskirts.
p247
aVRapid, because we wanted them to be served by rapid-transport vehicles.
p248
aVThey would get exclusive road use, where possible,
p249
aVand it would be high-quantity, high-quality transport.
p250
aVJames wanted to use bus rapid transport for that,
p251
aVrather than light rail.
p252
aVFor me, it was important
p253
aVthat the vehicles that would run on those rapid transport corridors
p254
aVwould be visibly distinguishable from local buses on the street.
p255
aVNow we could take out all the local buses
p256
aVthat ran alongside those rapid transport means.
p257
aVAny gaps that appeared in the outskirts were filled again.
p258
aVSo, in other words, if there was a street in an outskirt
p259
aVwhere there had been a bus, we put a bus back in,
p260
aVonly now these buses wouldn't run all the way to the city center,
p261
aVbut connect to the nearest rapid-transport mode,
p262
aVone of these thick lines over there.
p263
aVSo the rest was merely a couple of months of work,
p264
aVand a couple of fights with my girlfriend,
p265
aVof our place constantly being clogged up with maps,
p266
aVand the outcome, one of the outcomes,
p267
aVwas this map of the Greater Dublin area.
p268
aVI'll zoom in a little bit.
p269
aa(lp270
VThis map only shows the rapid transport connections, no local bus,
p271
aVvery much in the "metro map" style that was so successful in London,
p272
aVand that since has been exported to so many other major cities,
p273
aVand therefore is the language that we should use
p274
aVfor public transport maps.
p275
aVWhat's also important is, with a simplified network like this,
p276
aVit now would become possible for me to tackle the ultimate challenge
p277
aVand make a public transport map for the city center,
p278
aVone where I wouldn't just show rapid transport connections,
p279
aVbut also all the local bus routes, streets and the likes,
p280
aVand this is what a map like this could look like.
p281
aVI'll zoom in a little bit.
p282
aa(lp283
VIn this map, I'm including each transport mode,
p284
aVso rapid transport, bus, DART, tram and the likes.
p285
aVEach individual route is represented by a separate line.
p286
aVThe map shows each and every station,
p287
aVeach and every station name,
p288
aVand I'm also displaying side streets.
p289
aVIn fact, most of the side streets even with their name,
p290
aVand for good measure, also a couple of landmarks,
p291
aVsome of them signified by little symbols,
p292
aVothers by these isometric three-dimensional
p293
aVbird's-eye-view drawings.
p294
aa(lp295
VThe map is relatively small in overall size,
p296
aVso something that you could still hold as a fold-out map
p297
aVor display in a reasonably-sized display box on a bus shelter.
p298
aVI think it tries to be the best balance
p299
aVbetween actual representation and simplification \u2014
p300
aVthe language of way-finding in our brain.
p301
aVSo, straightened lines, cleaned-up corners,
p302
aVand of course, that very, very important geographic distortion
p303
aVthat makes public transport maps possible.
p304
aVIf you, for example, have a look at the two main corridors
p305
aVthat run through the city \u2014 the yellow and orange one over here \u2014
p306
aVthis is how they look in an actual, accurate street map,
p307
aVand this is how they would look in my distorted,
p308
aVsimplified public transport map.
p309
aa(lp310
VSo for a successful public transport map,
p311
aVwe should not stick to accurate representation,
p312
aVbut design them in the way our brains work.
p313
aa(lp314
VThe reactions I got were tremendous, it was really good to see.
p315
aVAnd of course, for my own self, I was very happy to see
p316
aVthat my folks in Germany and Greece finally have an idea
p317
aVwhat I do for a living.
p318
aa(lp319
V(Laughter)
p320
aa(lp321
VThank you.

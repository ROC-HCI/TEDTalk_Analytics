VSo it's 2006.
p5
aVMy friend Harold Ford calls me.
p6
aVHe's running for U.S. Senate in Tennessee,
p7
aVand he says, "Mellody, I desperately need some national press. Do you have any ideas?"
p8
aVSo I had an idea. I called a friend
p9
aVwho was in New York
p10
aVat one of the most successful media companies in the world,
p11
aVand she said, "Why don't we host
p12
aVan editorial board lunch for Harold?
p13
aVYou come with him."
p14
aa(lp15
VHarold and I arrive in New York.
p16
aVWe are in our best suits.
p17
aVWe look like shiny new pennies.
p18
aVAnd we get to the receptionist, and we say,
p19
aV"We're here for the lunch."
p20
aVShe motions for us to follow her.
p21
aVWe walk through a series of corridors,
p22
aVand all of a sudden we find ourselves
p23
aVin a stark room,
p24
aVat which point she looks at us and she says,
p25
aV"Where are your uniforms?"
p26
aa(lp27
VJust as this happens,
p28
aVmy friend rushes in.
p29
aVThe blood drains from her face.
p30
aVThere are literally no words, right?
p31
aVAnd I look at her, and I say,
p32
aV"Now, don't you think we need
p33
aVmore than one black person in the U.S. Senate?"
p34
aa(lp35
VNow Harold and I \u2014
p36
aV(Applause) \u2014
p37
aVwe still laugh about that story,
p38
aVand in many ways, the moment caught me off guard,
p39
aVbut deep, deep down inside,
p40
aVI actually wasn't surprised.
p41
aVAnd I wasn't surprised because of something
p42
aVmy mother taught me about 30 years before.
p43
aVYou see, my mother was ruthlessly realistic.
p44
aVI remember one day coming home from a birthday party
p45
aVwhere I was the only black kid invited,
p46
aVand instead of asking me the normal motherly questions
p47
aVlike, "Did you have fun?" or "How was the cake?"
p48
aVmy mother looked at me and she said,
p49
aV"How did they treat you?"
p50
aVI was seven. I did not understand.
p51
aVI mean, why would anyone treat me differently?
p52
aVBut she knew.
p53
aVAnd she looked me right in the eye and she said,
p54
aV"They will not always treat you well."
p55
aa(lp56
VNow, race is one of those topics in America
p57
aVthat makes people extraordinarily uncomfortable.
p58
aVYou bring it up at a dinner party
p59
aVor in a workplace environment,
p60
aVit is literally the conversational equivalent
p61
aVof touching the third rail.
p62
aVThere is shock,
p63
aVfollowed by a long silence.
p64
aVAnd even coming here today,
p65
aVI told some friends and colleagues
p66
aVthat I planned to talk about race,
p67
aVand they warned me, they told me, don't do it,
p68
aVthat there'd be huge risks
p69
aVin me talking about this topic,
p70
aVthat people might think I'm a militant black woman
p71
aVand I would ruin my career.
p72
aVAnd I have to tell you,
p73
aVI actually for a moment was a bit afraid.
p74
aVThen I realized,
p75
aVthe first step to solving any problem
p76
aVis to not hide from it,
p77
aVand the first step to any form of action
p78
aVis awareness.
p79
aVAnd so I decided to actually talk about race.
p80
aVAnd I decided that if I came here and shared with you
p81
aVsome of my experiences,
p82
aVthat maybe we could all be a little less anxious
p83
aVand a little more bold
p84
aVin our conversations about race.
p85
aa(lp86
VNow I know there are people out there who will say
p87
aVthat the election of Barack Obama meant
p88
aVthat it was the end of racial discrimination
p89
aVfor all eternity, right?
p90
aVBut I work in the investment business,
p91
aVand we have a saying:
p92
aVThe numbers do not lie.
p93
aVAnd here, there are significant,
p94
aVquantifiable racial disparities
p95
aVthat cannot be ignored,
p96
aVin household wealth, household income,
p97
aVjob opportunities, healthcare.
p98
aVOne example from corporate America:
p99
aVEven though white men
p100
aVmake up just 30 percent of the U.S. population,
p101
aVthey hold 70 percent of all corporate board seats.
p102
aVOf the Fortune 250,
p103
aVthere are only seven CEOs that are minorities,
p104
aVand of the thousands of publicly traded companies today, thousands,
p105
aVonly two are chaired by black women,
p106
aVand you're looking at one of them,
p107
aVthe same one who, not too long ago,
p108
aVwas nearly mistaken for kitchen help.
p109
aVSo that is a fact.
p110
aVNow I have this thought experiment
p111
aVthat I play with myself, when I say,
p112
aVimagine if I walked you into a room
p113
aVand it was of a major corporation, like ExxonMobil,
p114
aVand every single person around the boardroom were black,
p115
aVyou would think that were weird.
p116
aVBut if I walked you into a Fortune 500 company,
p117
aVand everyone around the table is a white male,
p118
aVwhen will it be that we think that's weird too?
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd I know how we got here.
p121
aV(Applause)
p122
aa(lp123
VI know how we got here.
p124
aVYou know, there was institutionalized,
p125
aVat one time legalized, discrimination in our country.
p126
aVThere's no question about it.
p127
aVBut still, as I grapple with this issue,
p128
aVmy mother's question hangs in the air for me:
p129
aVHow did they treat you?
p130
aa(lp131
VNow, I do not raise this issue to complain
p132
aVor in any way to elicit any kind of sympathy.
p133
aVI have succeeded in my life
p134
aVbeyond my wildest expectations,
p135
aVand I have been treated well by people of all races
p136
aVmore often than I have not.
p137
aVI tell the uniform story because it happened.
p138
aVI cite those statistics around corporate board diversity
p139
aVbecause they are real,
p140
aVand I stand here today
p141
aVtalking about this issue of racial discrimination
p142
aVbecause I believe it threatens to rob
p143
aVanother generation of all the opportunities
p144
aVthat all of us want for all of our children,
p145
aVno matter what their color
p146
aVor where they come from.
p147
aVAnd I think it also threatens to hold back businesses.
p148
aVYou see, researchers have coined this term
p149
aV"color blindness"
p150
aVto describe a learned behavior where we pretend
p151
aVthat we don't notice race.
p152
aVIf you happen to be surrounded by a bunch of people
p153
aVwho look like you, that's purely accidental.
p154
aVNow, color blindness, in my view,
p155
aVdoesn't mean that there's no racial discrimination,
p156
aVand there's fairness.
p157
aVIt doesn't mean that at all. It doesn't ensure it.
p158
aVIn my view, color blindness is very dangerous
p159
aVbecause it means we're ignoring the problem.
p160
aVThere was a corporate study that said that,
p161
aVinstead of avoiding race,
p162
aVthe really smart corporations actually deal with it head on.
p163
aVThey actually recognize that embracing diversity
p164
aVmeans recognizing all races,
p165
aVincluding the majority one.
p166
aVBut I'll be the first one to tell you,
p167
aVthis subject matter can be hard,
p168
aVawkward, uncomfortable \u2014 but that's kind of the point.
p169
aa(lp170
VIn the spirit of debunking racial stereotypes,
p171
aVthe one that black people don't like to swim,
p172
aVI'm going to tell you how much I love to swim.
p173
aVI love to swim so much
p174
aVthat as an adult, I swim with a coach.
p175
aVAnd one day my coach had me do a drill
p176
aVwhere I had to swim to one end of a 25-meter pool
p177
aVwithout taking a breath.
p178
aVAnd every single time I failed,
p179
aVI had to start over.
p180
aVAnd I failed a lot.
p181
aVBy the end, I got it, but when I got out of the pool,
p182
aVI was exasperated and tired and annoyed,
p183
aVand I said, "Why are we doing breath-holding exercises?"
p184
aVAnd my coach looked me at me, and he said, "Mellody,
p185
aVthat was not a breath-holding exercise.
p186
aVThat drill was to make you comfortable
p187
aVbeing uncomfortable,
p188
aVbecause that's how most of us spend our days."
p189
aVIf we can learn to deal with our discomfort,
p190
aVand just relax into it,
p191
aVwe'll have a better life.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo I think it's time for us to be comfortable
p194
aVwith the uncomfortable conversation about race:
p195
aVblack, white, Asian, Hispanic,
p196
aVmale, female, all of us,
p197
aVif we truly believe in equal rights
p198
aVand equal opportunity in America,
p199
aVI think we have to have real conversations
p200
aVabout this issue.
p201
aVWe cannot afford to be color blind.
p202
aVWe have to be color brave.
p203
aVWe have to be willing, as teachers and parents
p204
aVand entrepreneurs and scientists,
p205
aVwe have to be willing to have
p206
aVproactive conversations about race
p207
aVwith honesty and understanding and courage,
p208
aVnot because it's the right thing to do,
p209
aVbut because it's the smart thing to do,
p210
aVbecause our businesses and our products
p211
aVand our science, our research,
p212
aVall of that will be better with greater diversity.
p213
aa(lp214
VNow, my favorite example of color bravery
p215
aVis a guy named John Skipper.
p216
aVHe runs ESPN.
p217
aVHe's a North Carolina native,
p218
aVquintessential Southern gentleman, white.
p219
aVHe joined ESPN, which already had a culture
p220
aVof inclusion and diversity, but he took it up a notch.
p221
aVHe demanded that every open position
p222
aVhave a diverse slate of candidates.
p223
aVNow he says the senior people
p224
aVin the beginning bristled,
p225
aVand they would come to him and say,
p226
aV"Do you want me to hire the minority,
p227
aVor do you want me to hire the best person for the job?"
p228
aVAnd Skipper says his answers were always the same:
p229
aV"Yes."
p230
aVAnd by saying yes to diversity,
p231
aVI honestly believe that ESPN
p232
aVis the most valuable cable franchise in the world.
p233
aVI think that's a part of the secret sauce.
p234
aa(lp235
VNow I can tell you, in my own industry,
p236
aVat Ariel Investments, we actually view our diversity
p237
aVas a competitive advantage,
p238
aVand that advantage can extend way beyond business.
p239
aVThere's a guy named Scott Page at the University of Michigan.
p240
aVHe is the first person to develop
p241
aVa mathematical calculation for diversity.
p242
aVHe says, if you're trying to solve a really hard problem,
p243
aVreally hard,
p244
aVthat you should have a diverse group of people,
p245
aVincluding those with diverse intellects.
p246
aVThe example that he gives is the smallpox epidemic.
p247
aVWhen it was ravaging Europe,
p248
aVthey brought together all these scientists,
p249
aVand they were stumped.
p250
aVAnd the beginnings of the cure to the disease
p251
aVcame from the most unlikely source,
p252
aVa dairy farmer who noticed that the milkmaids
p253
aVwere not getting smallpox.
p254
aVAnd the smallpox vaccination is bovine-based
p255
aVbecause of that dairy farmer.
p256
aa(lp257
VNow I'm sure you're sitting here and you're saying,
p258
aVI don't run a cable company,
p259
aVI don't run an investment firm,
p260
aVI am not a dairy farmer.
p261
aVWhat can I do?
p262
aVAnd I'm telling you, you can be color brave.
p263
aVIf you're part of a hiring process
p264
aVor an admissions process,
p265
aVyou can be color brave.
p266
aVIf you are trying to solve a really hard problem,
p267
aVyou can speak up and be color brave.
p268
aVNow I know people will say,
p269
aVbut that doesn't add up to a lot,
p270
aVbut I'm actually asking you to do something really simple:
p271
aVobserve your environment,
p272
aVat work, at school, at home.
p273
aVI'm asking you to look at the people around you
p274
aVpurposefully and intentionally.
p275
aVInvite people into your life
p276
aVwho don't look like you, don't think like you,
p277
aVdon't act like you,
p278
aVdon't come from where you come from,
p279
aVand you might find that they will challenge your assumptions
p280
aVand make you grow as a person.
p281
aVYou might get powerful new insights
p282
aVfrom these individuals,
p283
aVor, like my husband, who happens to be white,
p284
aVyou might learn that black people,
p285
aVmen, women, children,
p286
aVwe use body lotion every single day.
p287
aa(lp288
VNow, I also think that this is very important
p289
aVso that the next generation really understands
p290
aVthat this progress will help them,
p291
aVbecause they're expecting us to be great role models.
p292
aa(lp293
VNow, I told you, my mother,
p294
aVshe was ruthlessly realistic.
p295
aVShe was an unbelievable role model.
p296
aVShe was the kind of person
p297
aVwho got to be the way she was
p298
aVbecause she was a single mom
p299
aVwith six kids in Chicago.
p300
aVShe was in the real estate business,
p301
aVwhere she worked extraordinarily hard
p302
aVbut oftentimes had a hard time making ends meet.
p303
aVAnd that meant sometimes we got
p304
aVour phone disconnected,
p305
aVor our lights turned off,
p306
aVor we got evicted.
p307
aVWhen we got evicted, sometimes we lived
p308
aVin these small apartments that she owned,
p309
aVsometimes in only one or two rooms,
p310
aVbecause they weren't completed,
p311
aVand we would heat our bathwater on hot plates.
p312
aVBut she never gave up hope, ever,
p313
aVand she never allowed us to give up hope either.
p314
aVThis brutal pragmatism that she had,
p315
aVI mean, I was four and she told me,
p316
aV"Mommy is Santa." (Laughter)
p317
aVShe was this brutal pragmatism.
p318
aVShe taught me so many lessons,
p319
aVbut the most important lesson
p320
aVwas that every single day she told me,
p321
aV"Mellody, you can be anything."
p322
aVAnd because of those words,
p323
aVI would wake up at the crack of dawn,
p324
aVand because of those words,
p325
aVI would love school more than anything,
p326
aVand because of those words, when I was on a bus
p327
aVgoing to school, I dreamed the biggest dreams.
p328
aVAnd it's because of those words that I stand here right now
p329
aVfull of passion,
p330
aVasking you to be brave for the kids
p331
aVwho are dreaming those dreams today.
p332
aV(Applause)
p333
aa(lp334
VYou see, I want them to look at a CEO on television
p335
aVand say, "I can be like her,"
p336
aVor, "He looks like me."
p337
aVAnd I want them to know
p338
aVthat anything is possible,
p339
aVthat they can achieve the highest level
p340
aVthat they ever imagined,
p341
aVthat they will be welcome in any corporate boardroom,
p342
aVor they can lead any company.
p343
aVYou see this idea of being the land
p344
aVof the free and the home of the brave,
p345
aVit's woven into the fabric of America.
p346
aVAmerica, when we have a challenge,
p347
aVwe take it head on, we don't shrink away from it.
p348
aVWe take a stand. We show courage.
p349
aVSo right now, what I'm asking you to do,
p350
aVI'm asking you to show courage.
p351
aVI'm asking you to be bold.
p352
aVAs business leaders, I'm asking you
p353
aVnot to leave anything on the table.
p354
aVAs citizens, I'm asking you not to leave any child behind.
p355
aVI'm asking you not to be color blind,
p356
aVbut to be color brave,
p357
aVso that every child knows that their future matters
p358
aVand their dreams are possible.
p359
aa(lp360
VThank you.
p361
aa(lp362
V(Applause)
p363
aVThank you. Thanks. Thanks. (Applause)

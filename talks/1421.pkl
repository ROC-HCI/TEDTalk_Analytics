VI got my start
p5
aVin writing and research
p6
aVas a surgical trainee,
p7
aVas someone who was a long ways away
p8
aVfrom becoming any kind of an expert at anything.
p9
aVSo the natural question you ask then at that point
p10
aVis, how do I get good at what I'm trying to do?
p11
aVAnd it became a question of,
p12
aVhow do we all get good
p13
aVat what we're trying to do?
p14
aa(lp15
VIt's hard enough to learn to get the skills,
p16
aVtry to learn all the material you have to absorb
p17
aVat any task you're taking on.
p18
aVI had to think about how I sew and how I cut,
p19
aVbut then also how I pick the right person
p20
aVto come to an operating room.
p21
aVAnd then in the midst of all this
p22
aVcame this new context
p23
aVfor thinking about what it meant to be good.
p24
aa(lp25
VIn the last few years
p26
aVwe realized we were in the deepest crisis
p27
aVof medicine's existence
p28
aVdue to something you don't normally think about
p29
aVwhen you're a doctor
p30
aVconcerned with how you do good for people,
p31
aVwhich is the cost
p32
aVof health care.
p33
aVThere's not a country in the world
p34
aVthat now is not asking
p35
aVwhether we can afford what doctors do.
p36
aVThe political fight that we've developed
p37
aVhas become one around
p38
aVwhether it's the government that's the problem
p39
aVor is it insurance companies that are the problem.
p40
aVAnd the answer is yes and no;
p41
aVit's deeper than all of that.
p42
aa(lp43
VThe cause of our troubles
p44
aVis actually the complexity that science has given us.
p45
aVAnd in order to understand this,
p46
aVI'm going to take you back a couple of generations.
p47
aVI want to take you back
p48
aVto a time when Lewis Thomas was writing in his book, "The Youngest Science."
p49
aVLewis Thomas was a physician-writer,
p50
aVone of my favorite writers.
p51
aVAnd he wrote this book to explain, among other things,
p52
aVwhat it was like to be a medical intern
p53
aVat the Boston City Hospital
p54
aVin the pre-penicillin year
p55
aVof 1937.
p56
aVIt was a time when medicine was cheap
p57
aVand very ineffective.
p58
aVIf you were in a hospital, he said,
p59
aVit was going to do you good
p60
aVonly because it offered you
p61
aVsome warmth, some food, shelter,
p62
aVand maybe the caring attention
p63
aVof a nurse.
p64
aVDoctors and medicine
p65
aVmade no difference at all.
p66
aVThat didn't seem to prevent the doctors
p67
aVfrom being frantically busy in their days,
p68
aVas he explained.
p69
aa(lp70
VWhat they were trying to do
p71
aVwas figure out whether you might have one of the diagnoses
p72
aVfor which they could do something.
p73
aVAnd there were a few.
p74
aVYou might have a lobar pneumonia, for example,
p75
aVand they could give you an antiserum,
p76
aVan injection of rabid antibodies
p77
aVto the bacterium streptococcus,
p78
aVif the intern sub-typed it correctly.
p79
aVIf you had an acute congestive heart failure,
p80
aVthey could bleed a pint of blood from you
p81
aVby opening up an arm vein,
p82
aVgiving you a crude leaf preparation of digitalis
p83
aVand then giving you oxygen by tent.
p84
aVIf you had early signs of paralysis
p85
aVand you were really good at asking personal questions,
p86
aVyou might figure out
p87
aVthat this paralysis someone has is from syphilis,
p88
aVin which case you could give this nice concoction
p89
aVof mercury and arsenic \u2014
p90
aVas long as you didn't overdose them and kill them.
p91
aVBeyond these sorts of things,
p92
aVa medical doctor didn't have a lot that they could do.
p93
aa(lp94
VThis was when the core structure of medicine
p95
aVwas created \u2014
p96
aVwhat it meant to be good at what we did
p97
aVand how we wanted to build medicine to be.
p98
aVIt was at a time
p99
aVwhen what was known you could know,
p100
aVyou could hold it all in your head, and you could do it all.
p101
aVIf you had a prescription pad,
p102
aVif you had a nurse,
p103
aVif you had a hospital
p104
aVthat would give you a place to convalesce, maybe some basic tools,
p105
aVyou really could do it all.
p106
aVYou set the fracture, you drew the blood,
p107
aVyou spun the blood,
p108
aVlooked at it under the microscope,
p109
aVyou plated the culture, you injected the antiserum.
p110
aVThis was a life as a craftsman.
p111
aa(lp112
VAs a result, we built it around
p113
aVa culture and set of values
p114
aVthat said what you were good at
p115
aVwas being daring,
p116
aVat being courageous,
p117
aVat being independent and self-sufficient.
p118
aVAutonomy was our highest value.
p119
aVGo a couple generations forward
p120
aVto where we are, though,
p121
aVand it looks like a completely different world.
p122
aVWe have now found treatments
p123
aVfor nearly all of the tens of thousands of conditions
p124
aVthat a human being can have.
p125
aVWe can't cure it all.
p126
aVWe can't guarantee that everybody will live a long and healthy life.
p127
aVBut we can make it possible
p128
aVfor most.
p129
aa(lp130
VBut what does it take?
p131
aVWell, we've now discovered
p132
aV4,000 medical and surgical procedures.
p133
aVWe've discovered 6,000 drugs
p134
aVthat I'm now licensed to prescribe.
p135
aVAnd we're trying to deploy this capability,
p136
aVtown by town,
p137
aVto every person alive \u2014
p138
aVin our own country,
p139
aVlet alone around the world.
p140
aVAnd we've reached the point where we've realized,
p141
aVas doctors,
p142
aVwe can't know it all.
p143
aVWe can't do it all
p144
aVby ourselves.
p145
aa(lp146
VThere was a study where they looked
p147
aVat how many clinicians it took to take care of you
p148
aVif you came into a hospital,
p149
aVas it changed over time.
p150
aVAnd in the year 1970,
p151
aVit took just over two full-time equivalents of clinicians.
p152
aVThat is to say,
p153
aVit took basically the nursing time
p154
aVand then just a little bit of time for a doctor
p155
aVwho more or less checked in on you
p156
aVonce a day.
p157
aVBy the end of the 20th century,
p158
aVit had become more than 15 clinicians
p159
aVfor the same typical hospital patient \u2014
p160
aVspecialists, physical therapists,
p161
aVthe nurses.
p162
aa(lp163
VWe're all specialists now,
p164
aVeven the primary care physicians.
p165
aVEveryone just has
p166
aVa piece of the care.
p167
aVBut holding onto that structure we built
p168
aVaround the daring, independence,
p169
aVself-sufficiency
p170
aVof each of those people
p171
aVhas become a disaster.
p172
aVWe have trained, hired and rewarded people
p173
aVto be cowboys.
p174
aVBut it's pit crews that we need,
p175
aVpit crews for patients.
p176
aa(lp177
VThere's evidence all around us:
p178
aV40 percent of our coronary artery disease patients
p179
aVin our communities
p180
aVreceive incomplete or inappropriate care.
p181
aV60 percent
p182
aVof our asthma, stroke patients
p183
aVreceive incomplete or inappropriate care.
p184
aVTwo million people come into hospitals
p185
aVand pick up an infection
p186
aVthey didn't have
p187
aVbecause someone failed to follow
p188
aVthe basic practices of hygiene.
p189
aVOur experience
p190
aVas people who get sick,
p191
aVneed help from other people,
p192
aVis that we have amazing clinicians
p193
aVthat we can turn to \u2014
p194
aVhardworking, incredibly well-trained and very smart \u2014
p195
aVthat we have access to incredible technologies
p196
aVthat give us great hope,
p197
aVbut little sense
p198
aVthat it consistently all comes together for you
p199
aVfrom start to finish
p200
aVin a successful way.
p201
aa(lp202
VThere's another sign
p203
aVthat we need pit crews,
p204
aVand that's the unmanageable cost
p205
aVof our care.
p206
aVNow we in medicine, I think,
p207
aVare baffled by this question of cost.
p208
aVWe want to say, "This is just the way it is.
p209
aVThis is just what medicine requires."
p210
aVWhen you go from a world
p211
aVwhere you treated arthritis with aspirin,
p212
aVthat mostly didn't do the job,
p213
aVto one where, if it gets bad enough,
p214
aVwe can do a hip replacement, a knee replacement
p215
aVthat gives you years, maybe decades,
p216
aVwithout disability,
p217
aVa dramatic change,
p218
aVwell is it any surprise
p219
aVthat that $40,000 hip replacement
p220
aVreplacing the 10-cent aspirin
p221
aVis more expensive?
p222
aVIt's just the way it is.
p223
aa(lp224
VBut I think we're ignoring certain facts
p225
aVthat tell us something about what we can do.
p226
aVAs we've looked at the data
p227
aVabout the results that have come
p228
aVas the complexity has increased,
p229
aVwe found
p230
aVthat the most expensive care
p231
aVis not necessarily the best care.
p232
aVAnd vice versa,
p233
aVthe best care
p234
aVoften turns out to be the least expensive \u2014
p235
aVhas fewer complications,
p236
aVthe people get more efficient at what they do.
p237
aVAnd what that means
p238
aVis there's hope.
p239
aVBecause [if] to have the best results,
p240
aVyou really needed the most expensive care
p241
aVin the country, or in the world,
p242
aVwell then we really would be talking about rationing
p243
aVwho we're going to cut off from Medicare.
p244
aVThat would be really our only choice.
p245
aa(lp246
VBut when we look at the positive deviants \u2014
p247
aVthe ones who are getting the best results
p248
aVat the lowest costs \u2014
p249
aVwe find the ones that look the most like systems
p250
aVare the most successful.
p251
aVThat is to say, they found ways
p252
aVto get all of the different pieces,
p253
aVall of the different components,
p254
aVto come together into a whole.
p255
aVHaving great components is not enough,
p256
aVand yet we've been obsessed in medicine with components.
p257
aVWe want the best drugs, the best technologies,
p258
aVthe best specialists,
p259
aVbut we don't think too much
p260
aVabout how it all comes together.
p261
aVIt's a terrible design strategy actually.
p262
aa(lp263
VThere's a famous thought experiment
p264
aVthat touches exactly on this
p265
aVthat said, what if you built a car
p266
aVfrom the very best car parts?
p267
aVWell it would lead you to put in Porsche brakes,
p268
aVa Ferrari engine,
p269
aVa Volvo body, a BMW chassis.
p270
aVAnd you put it all together and what do you get?
p271
aVA very expensive pile of junk that does not go anywhere.
p272
aVAnd that is what medicine can feel like sometimes.
p273
aVIt's not a system.
p274
aa(lp275
VNow a system, however,
p276
aVwhen things start to come together,
p277
aVyou realize it has certain skills
p278
aVfor acting and looking that way.
p279
aVSkill number one
p280
aVis the ability to recognize success
p281
aVand the ability to recognize failure.
p282
aVWhen you are a specialist,
p283
aVyou can't see the end result very well.
p284
aVYou have to become really interested in data,
p285
aVunsexy as that sounds.
p286
aa(lp287
VOne of my colleagues is a surgeon in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,
p288
aVand he got interested in the question of,
p289
aVwell how many CT scans did they do
p290
aVfor their community in Cedar Rapids?
p291
aVHe got interested in this
p292
aVbecause there had been government reports,
p293
aVnewspaper reports, journal articles
p294
aVsaying that there had been too many CT scans done.
p295
aVHe didn't see it in his own patients.
p296
aVAnd so he asked the question, "How many did we do?"
p297
aVand he wanted to get the data.
p298
aVIt took him three months.
p299
aVNo one had asked this question in his community before.
p300
aVAnd what he found was that,
p301
aVfor the 300,000 people in their community,
p302
aVin the previous year
p303
aVthey had done 52,000 CT scans.
p304
aVThey had found a problem.
p305
aa(lp306
VWhich brings us to skill number two a system has.
p307
aVSkill one, find where your failures are.
p308
aVSkill two is devise solutions.
p309
aVI got interested in this
p310
aVwhen the World Health Organization came to my team
p311
aVasking if we could help with a project
p312
aVto reduce deaths in surgery.
p313
aVThe volume of surgery had spread
p314
aVaround the world,
p315
aVbut the safety of surgery
p316
aVhad not.
p317
aVNow our usual tactics for tackling problems like these
p318
aVare to do more training,
p319
aVgive people more specialization
p320
aVor bring in more technology.
p321
aa(lp322
VWell in surgery, you couldn't have people who are more specialized
p323
aVand you couldn't have people who are better trained.
p324
aVAnd yet we see unconscionable levels
p325
aVof death, disability
p326
aVthat could be avoided.
p327
aVAnd so we looked at what other high-risk industries do.
p328
aVWe looked at skyscraper construction,
p329
aVwe looked at the aviation world,
p330
aVand we found
p331
aVthat they have technology, they have training,
p332
aVand then they have one other thing:
p333
aVThey have checklists.
p334
aVI did not expect
p335
aVto be spending a significant part
p336
aVof my time as a Harvard surgeon
p337
aVworrying about checklists.
p338
aVAnd yet, what we found
p339
aVwere that these were tools
p340
aVto help make experts better.
p341
aVWe got the lead safety engineer for Boeing to help us.
p342
aa(lp343
VCould we design a checklist for surgery?
p344
aVNot for the lowest people on the totem pole,
p345
aVbut for the folks
p346
aVwho were all the way around the chain,
p347
aVthe entire team including the surgeons.
p348
aVAnd what they taught us
p349
aVwas that designing a checklist
p350
aVto help people handle complexity
p351
aVactually involves more difficulty than I had understood.
p352
aVYou have to think about things
p353
aVlike pause points.
p354
aVYou need to identify the moments in a process
p355
aVwhen you can actually catch a problem before it's a danger
p356
aVand do something about it.
p357
aVYou have to identify
p358
aVthat this is a before-takeoff checklist.
p359
aVAnd then you need to focus on the killer items.
p360
aVAn aviation checklist,
p361
aVlike this one for a single-engine plane,
p362
aVisn't a recipe for how to fly a plane,
p363
aVit's a reminder of the key things
p364
aVthat get forgotten or missed
p365
aVif they're not checked.
p366
aa(lp367
VSo we did this.
p368
aVWe created a 19-item two-minute checklist
p369
aVfor surgical teams.
p370
aVWe had the pause points
p371
aVimmediately before anesthesia is given,
p372
aVimmediately before the knife hits the skin,
p373
aVimmediately before the patient leaves the room.
p374
aVAnd we had a mix of dumb stuff on there \u2014
p375
aVmaking sure an antibiotic is given in the right time frame
p376
aVbecause that cuts the infection rate by half \u2014
p377
aVand then interesting stuff,
p378
aVbecause you can't make a recipe for something as complicated as surgery.
p379
aVInstead, you can make a recipe
p380
aVfor how to have a team that's prepared for the unexpected.
p381
aVAnd we had items like making sure everyone in the room
p382
aVhad introduced themselves by name at the start of the day,
p383
aVbecause you get half a dozen people or more
p384
aVwho are sometimes coming together as a team
p385
aVfor the very first time that day that you're coming in.
p386
aa(lp387
VWe implemented this checklist
p388
aVin eight hospitals around the world,
p389
aVdeliberately in places from rural Tanzania
p390
aVto the University of Washington in Seattle.
p391
aVWe found that after they adopted it
p392
aVthe complication rates fell
p393
aV35 percent.
p394
aVIt fell in every hospital it went into.
p395
aVThe death rates fell
p396
aV47 percent.
p397
aVThis was bigger than a drug.
p398
aa(lp399
V(Applause)
p400
aa(lp401
VAnd that brings us
p402
aVto skill number three,
p403
aVthe ability to implement this,
p404
aVto get colleagues across the entire chain
p405
aVto actually do these things.
p406
aVAnd it's been slow to spread.
p407
aVThis is not yet our norm in surgery \u2014
p408
aVlet alone making checklists
p409
aVto go onto childbirth and other areas.
p410
aVThere's a deep resistance
p411
aVbecause using these tools
p412
aVforces us to confront
p413
aVthat we're not a system,
p414
aVforces us to behave with a different set of values.
p415
aVJust using a checklist
p416
aVrequires you to embrace different values from the ones we've had,
p417
aVlike humility,
p418
aVdiscipline,
p419
aVteamwork.
p420
aVThis is the opposite of what we were built on:
p421
aVindependence, self-sufficiency,
p422
aVautonomy.
p423
aa(lp424
VI met an actual cowboy, by the way.
p425
aVI asked him, what was it like
p426
aVto actually herd a thousand cattle
p427
aVacross hundreds of miles?
p428
aVHow did you do that?
p429
aVAnd he said, "We have the cowboys stationed at distinct places all around."
p430
aVThey communicate electronically constantly,
p431
aVand they have protocols and checklists
p432
aVfor how they handle everything \u2014
p433
aV(Laughter)
p434
aV\u2014 from bad weather
p435
aVto emergencies or inoculations for the cattle.
p436
aVEven the cowboys are pit crews now.
p437
aVAnd it seemed like time
p438
aVthat we become that way ourselves.
p439
aa(lp440
VMaking systems work
p441
aVis the great task of my generation
p442
aVof physicians and scientists.
p443
aVBut I would go further and say
p444
aVthat making systems work,
p445
aVwhether in health care, education,
p446
aVclimate change,
p447
aVmaking a pathway out of poverty,
p448
aVis the great task of our generation as a whole.
p449
aVIn every field, knowledge has exploded,
p450
aVbut it has brought complexity,
p451
aVit has brought specialization.
p452
aVAnd we've come to a place where we have no choice
p453
aVbut to recognize,
p454
aVas individualistic as we want to be,
p455
aVcomplexity requires
p456
aVgroup success.
p457
aVWe all need to be pit crews now.
p458

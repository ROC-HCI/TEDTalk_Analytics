VMy name is Dan Cohen and I am an academic, as he said.
p5
aVAnd what that means is that I argue.
p6
aVIt's an important part of my life.
p7
aVAnd I like to argue.
p8
aVAnd I'm not just an academic, I'm a philosopher,
p9
aVso I like to think that I'm actually pretty good at arguing.
p10
aa(lp11
VBut I also like to think a lot about arguing.
p12
aVAnd in thinking about arguing, I've come across some puzzles.
p13
aVAnd one of the puzzles is that,
p14
aVas I've been thinking about arguing over the years \u2014
p15
aVand it's been decades now \u2014
p16
aVI've gotten better at arguing.
p17
aVBut the more that I argue and the better I get at arguing,
p18
aVthe more that I lose.
p19
aVAnd that's a puzzle.
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd the other puzzle is that I'm actually okay with that.
p22
aVWhy is it that I'm okay with losing
p23
aVand why is it that I think good arguers are actually better at losing?
p24
aVWell, there are some other puzzles.
p25
aVOne is: why do we argue?
p26
aVWho benefits from arguments?
p27
aVWhen I think about arguments, I'm talking about \u2014
p28
aVlet's call them academic arguments or cognitive arguments \u2014
p29
aVwhere something cognitive is at stake:
p30
aVIs this proposition true? Is this theory a good theory?
p31
aVIs this a viable interpretation of the data or the text? And so on.
p32
aVI'm not interested really in arguments about whose turn it is to do the dishes
p33
aVor who has to take out the garbage.
p34
aVYeah, we have those arguments, too.
p35
aVI tend to win those arguments, because I know the tricks.
p36
aVBut those aren't the important arguments.
p37
aVI'm interested in academic arguments,
p38
aVand here are the things that puzzle me.
p39
aa(lp40
VFirst, what do good arguers win when they win an argument?
p41
aVWhat do I win if I convince you
p42
aVthat utilitarianism isn't really the right framework
p43
aVfor thinking about ethical theories?
p44
aVWhat do we win when we win an argument?
p45
aVEven before that,
p46
aVwhat does it matter to me
p47
aVwhether you have this idea that Kant's theory works
p48
aVor Mill is the right ethicist to follow?
p49
aVIt's no skin off my back
p50
aVwhether you think functionalism is a viable theory of mind.
p51
aVSo why do we even try to argue?
p52
aVWhy do we try to convince other people
p53
aVto believe things they don't want to believe,
p54
aVand is that even a nice thing to do?
p55
aVIs that a nice way to treat another human being,
p56
aVtry and make them think something they don't want to think?
p57
aVWell, my answer is going to make reference to three models for arguments.
p58
aa(lp59
VThe first model \u2014 let's call it the dialectical model \u2014
p60
aVis we think of arguments as war; you know what that's like \u2014
p61
aVa lot of screaming and shouting and winning and losing.
p62
aVThat's not a very helpful model for arguing,
p63
aVbut it's a pretty common and entrenched model for arguing.
p64
aa(lp65
VBut there's a second model for arguing: arguments as proofs.
p66
aVThink of a mathematician's argument.
p67
aVHere's my argument. Does it work? Is it any good?
p68
aVAre the premises warranted? Are the inferences valid?
p69
aVDoes the conclusion follow from the premises?
p70
aVNo opposition, no adversariality \u2014
p71
aVnot necessarily any arguing in the adversarial sense.
p72
aa(lp73
VBut there's a third model to keep in mind
p74
aVthat I think is going to be very helpful,
p75
aVand that is arguments as performances, arguments in front of an audience.
p76
aVWe can think of a politician trying to present a position,
p77
aVtrying to convince the audience of something.
p78
aa(lp79
VBut there's another twist on this model that I really think is important;
p80
aVnamely, that when we argue before an audience,
p81
aVsometimes the audience has a more participatory role in the argument;
p82
aVthat is, arguments are also [performances] in front of juries,
p83
aVwho make a judgment and decide the case.
p84
aVLet's call this the rhetorical model,
p85
aVwhere you have to tailor your argument to the audience at hand.
p86
aVYou know, presenting a sound, well-argued,
p87
aVtight argument in English before a francophone audience
p88
aVjust isn't going to work.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo we have these models \u2014 argument as war, argument as proof
p91
aVand argument as performance.
p92
aVOf those three, the argument as war is the dominant one.
p93
aVIt dominates how we talk about arguments,
p94
aVit dominates how we think about arguments,
p95
aVand because of that, it shapes how we argue,
p96
aVour actual conduct in arguments.
p97
aVNow, when we talk about arguments,
p98
aVwe talk in a very militaristic language.
p99
aVWe want strong arguments, arguments that have a lot of punch,
p100
aVarguments that are right on target.
p101
aVWe want to have our defenses up and our strategies all in order.
p102
aVWe want killer arguments.
p103
aVThat's the kind of argument we want.
p104
aVIt is the dominant way of thinking about arguments.
p105
aVWhen I'm talking about arguments,
p106
aVthat's probably what you thought of, the adversarial model.
p107
aa(lp108
VBut the war metaphor,
p109
aVthe war paradigm or model for thinking about arguments,
p110
aVhas, I think, deforming effects on how we argue.
p111
aVFirst, it elevates tactics over substance.
p112
aVYou can take a class in logic, argumentation.
p113
aVYou learn all about the subterfuges
p114
aVthat people use to try and win arguments \u2014 the false steps.
p115
aVIt magnifies the us-versus them aspect of it.
p116
aVIt makes it adversarial; it's polarizing.
p117
aVAnd the only foreseeable outcomes are triumph \u2014 glorious triumph \u2014
p118
aVor abject, ignominious defeat.
p119
aVI think those are deforming effects,
p120
aVand worst of all, it seems to prevent things like negotiation
p121
aVor deliberation or compromise or collaboration.
p122
aa(lp123
VThink about that one \u2014 have you ever entered an argument thinking,
p124
aV"Let's see if we can hash something out, rather than fight it out.
p125
aVWhat can we work out together?"
p126
aVI think the argument-as-war metaphor
p127
aVinhibits those other kinds of resolutions to argumentation.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd finally \u2014 this is really the worst thing \u2014
p130
aVarguments don't seem to get us anywhere; they're dead ends.
p131
aVThey are like roundabouts or traffic jams or gridlock in conversation.
p132
aVWe don't get anywhere.
p133
aVAnd one more thing.
p134
aVAnd as an educator, this is the one that really bothers me:
p135
aVIf argument is war,
p136
aVthen there's an implicit equation of learning with losing.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd let me explain what I mean.
p139
aVSuppose you and I have an argument.
p140
aVYou believe a proposition, P, and I don't.
p141
aVAnd I say, "Well, why do you believe P?"
p142
aVAnd you give me your reasons.
p143
aVAnd I object and say, "Well, what about ...?"
p144
aVAnd you answer my objection.
p145
aVAnd I have a question: "Well, what do you mean?
p146
aVHow does it apply over here?"
p147
aVAnd you answer my question.
p148
aVNow, suppose at the end of the day,
p149
aVI've objected, I've questioned,
p150
aVI've raised all sorts of counter counter-considerations
p151
aVand in every case you've responded to my satisfaction.
p152
aVAnd so at the end of the day, I say,
p153
aV"You know what? I guess you're right: P."
p154
aVSo, I have a new belief.
p155
aVAnd it's not just any belief;
p156
aVit's well-articulated, examined \u2014 it's a battle-tested belief.
p157
aa(lp158
VGreat cognitive gain.
p159
aVOK, who won that argument?
p160
aVWell, the war metaphor seems to force us into saying you won,
p161
aVeven though I'm the only one who made any cognitive gain.
p162
aVWhat did you gain, cognitively, from convincing me?
p163
aVSure, you got some pleasure out of it, maybe your ego stroked,
p164
aVmaybe you get some professional status
p165
aVin the field \u2014 "This guy's a good arguer."
p166
aVBut just from a cognitive point of view,
p167
aVwho was the winner?
p168
aVThe war metaphor forces us into thinking that you're the winner and I lost,
p169
aVeven though I gained.
p170
aVAnd there's something wrong with that picture.
p171
aVAnd that's the picture I really want to change if we can.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo, how can we find ways
p174
aVto make arguments yield something positive?
p175
aVWhat we need is new exit strategies for arguments.
p176
aVBut we're not going to have new exit strategies for arguments
p177
aVuntil we have new entry approaches to arguments.
p178
aVWe need to think of new kinds of arguments.
p179
aVIn order to do that, well \u2014
p180
aVI don't know how to do that.
p181
aVThat's the bad news.
p182
aVThe argument-as-war metaphor is just ... it's a monster.
p183
aVIt's just taken up habitation in our mind,
p184
aVand there's no magic bullet that's going to kill it.
p185
aVThere's no magic wand that's going to make it disappear.
p186
aVI don't have an answer.
p187
aa(lp188
VBut I have some suggestions.
p189
aVHere's my suggestion:
p190
aVIf we want to think of new kinds of arguments,
p191
aVwhat we need to do is think of new kinds of arguers.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo try this:
p194
aVThink of all the roles that people play in arguments.
p195
aVThere's the proponent and the opponent
p196
aVin an adversarial, dialectical argument.
p197
aVThere's the audience in rhetorical arguments.
p198
aVThere's the reasoner in arguments as proofs.
p199
aVAll these different roles.
p200
aVNow, can you imagine an argument in which you are the arguer,
p201
aVbut you're also in the audience, watching yourself argue?
p202
aVCan you imagine yourself watching yourself argue,
p203
aVlosing the argument, and yet still, at the end of the argument, saying,
p204
aV"Wow, that was a good argument!"
p205
aVCan you do that?
p206
aVI think you can, and I think if you can imagine that kind of argument,
p207
aVwhere the loser says to the winner and the audience and the jury can say,
p208
aV"Yeah, that was a good argument,"
p209
aVthen you have imagined a good argument.
p210
aVAnd more than that,
p211
aVI think you've imagined a good arguer,
p212
aVan arguer that's worthy of the kind of arguer you should try to be.
p213
aa(lp214
VNow, I lose a lot of arguments.
p215
aVIt takes practice to become a good arguer,
p216
aVin the sense of being able to benefit from losing, but fortunately,
p217
aVI've had many, many colleagues who have been willing to step up
p218
aVand provide that practice for me.
p219
aa(lp220
VThank you.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Applause)

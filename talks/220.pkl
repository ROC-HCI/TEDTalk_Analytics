VMy name is Joseph, a Member of Parliament in Kenya.
p5
aVPicture a Maasai village,
p6
aVand one evening,
p7
aVgovernment soldiers come, surround the village
p8
aVand ask each elder to bring one boy to school.
p9
aVThat's how I went to school \u2014
p10
aVpretty much a government guy pointing a gun
p11
aVand told my father, "You have to make a choice."
p12
aVI walked very comfortably to this missionary school,
p13
aVthat was run by an American missionary.
p14
aVThe first thing the American missionary gave me was a candy.
p15
aVI had never in my life ever tasted candy.
p16
aVSo I said to myself, with all these hundred other boys,
p17
aVthis is where I belong.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter) I stayed.
p20
aa(lp21
VWhen everybody else was dropping out.
p22
aVMy family moved; we're nomads.
p23
aVIt was a boarding school, I was seven \u2014
p24
aVEvery time it closed you had to travel to find them.
p25
aV40-50 miles, it doesn't matter.
p26
aVYou slept in the bush, but you kept going.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd I stayed. I don't know why, but I did.
p29
aVAll of a sudden I passed the national examination,
p30
aVfound myself in a very beautiful high school in Kenya.
p31
aVAnd I finished high school.
p32
aVAnd just walking, I found a man
p33
aVwho gave me a full scholarship to the United States.
p34
aVMy mother still lived in a cow-dung hut,
p35
aVnone of my brothers were going to school,
p36
aVand this man told me, "Here, go."
p37
aa(lp38
VI got a scholarship
p39
aVto St. Lawrence University, Upstate New York;
p40
aVfinished that.
p41
aVAnd after that I went to Harvard Graduate School;
p42
aVfinished that.
p43
aVThen I worked in DC a little bit:
p44
aVI wrote a book for National Geographic and taught U.S. history.
p45
aVAnd every time, I kept going back home,
p46
aVlistening to their problems \u2014
p47
aVsick people, people with no water, all this stuff \u2014
p48
aVevery time I go back to America,
p49
aVI kept thinking about them.
p50
aa(lp51
VThen one day, an elder gave me a story that went like this:
p52
aVlong time ago, there was a big war between tribes.
p53
aVThis specific tribe was really afraid of this other Luhya tribe.
p54
aVEvery time, they sent scouts to make sure no one attacked them.
p55
aVSo one day, the scouts came running and told the villagers,
p56
aV"The enemies are coming. Only half an hour away, they'll be here."
p57
aVSo people scrambled, took their things and ready to go, move out.
p58
aVBut there were two men:
p59
aVone man was blind, one man had no legs
p60
aV\u2014 he was born like that.
p61
aVThe leader of the chiefs said, "No, sorry. We can't take you. You'll slow us down.
p62
aVWe have to flee our women and children, we have to run."
p63
aVAnd they were left behind, waiting to die.
p64
aa(lp65
VBut these two people worked something out.
p66
aVThe blind man said, "Look, I'm a very strong man but I can't see."
p67
aVThe man with no legs says, "I can see as far as the end of the world,
p68
aVbut I can't save myself from a cat, or whatever animals."
p69
aVThe blind man went down on his knees like this,
p70
aVand told the man with no legs to go over his back, and stood up.
p71
aVThe man on top can see, the blind man can walk.
p72
aVThese guys took off, followed the footsteps of the villagers
p73
aVuntil they found and passed them.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo, this was told to me in a setup of elders.
p76
aVAnd it's a really poor area.
p77
aVI represent Northern Kenya:
p78
aVthe most nomadic, remote areas you can even find.
p79
aVAnd that man told me, "So, here you are.
p80
aVYou've got a good education from America, you have a good life in America;
p81
aVwhat are you going to do for us?
p82
aVWe want you to be our eyes, we'll give you the legs.
p83
aVWe'll walk you, you lead us."
p84
aa(lp85
VThe opportunity came. I was always thinking about that:
p86
aV"What can I do to help my people?
p87
aVEvery time you go to an area where for 43 years of independence,
p88
aVwe still don't have basic health facilities.
p89
aVA man has to be transported in a wheelbarrow 30 km for a hospital.
p90
aVNo clean drinking water.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo I said, "I'm going to dedicate myself.
p93
aVI'm leaving America.
p94
aVI'm going to run for office."
p95
aVLast June, I moved from America,
p96
aVran in July election and won.
p97
aVAnd I came for them,
p98
aVand that's my goal.
p99
aa(lp100
VRight now I have in place, for the last nine months,
p101
aVa plan that in five years,
p102
aVevery nomad will have clean drinking water.
p103
aVWe're building dispensaries across that constituency.
p104
aVI'm asking my friends from America to help
p105
aVwith bringing nurses or doctors to help us out.
p106
aVI'm trying to improve infrastructure.
p107
aVI'm using the knowledge I received from the United States
p108
aVand from my community
p109
aVto move them forward.
p110
aVI'm trying to develop homegrown solutions to our issues
p111
aVbecause people from outside can come and help us,
p112
aVbut if we don't help ourselves, there's nothing to do.
p113
aa(lp114
VMy plan right now
p115
aVas I continue with introducing students to different fields \u2014
p116
aVsome become doctors, some lawyers \u2014
p117
aVwe want to produce a comprehensive group of people,
p118
aVstudents who can come back and help us see a community grow
p119
aVthat is in the middle of a huge economic recession.
p120
aa(lp121
VAs I continue to be a Member of Parliament
p122
aVand as I continue listening to all of you talking about botany,
p123
aVhealth, democracy, new inventions,
p124
aVI'm hoping that one day in my own little community \u2014
p125
aVwhich is 26,000 square km,
p126
aVmaybe five times Rhode Island \u2014
p127
aVwith no roads,
p128
aVwe'll be able to become a model to help others develop.
p129
aa(lp130
VThank you very much.

V(Applause)
p5
aa(lp6
VThank you very much.
p7
aVI have a few pictures,
p8
aVand I'll talk a little bit about how I'm able to do what I do.
p9
aVAll these houses are built
p10
aVfrom between 70 and 80 percent recycled material,
p11
aVstuff that was headed to the mulcher, the landfill, the burn pile.
p12
aVIt was all just gone.
p13
aVThis is the first house I built.
p14
aVThis double front door here with the three-light transom,
p15
aVthat was headed to the landfill.
p16
aVHave a little turret there.
p17
aVAnd then these buttons on the corbels here \u2014
p18
aVright there \u2014
p19
aVthose are hickory nuts.
p20
aVAnd these buttons there \u2014
p21
aVthose are chicken eggs.
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VOf course, first you have breakfast,
p26
aVand then you fill the shell full of Bondo and paint it and nail it up,
p27
aVand you have an architectural button in just a fraction of the time.
p28
aa(lp29
VThis is a look at the inside.
p30
aVYou can see the three-light transom there with the eyebrow windows.
p31
aVCertainly an architectural antique headed to the landfill \u2014
p32
aVeven the lockset is probably worth 200 dollars.
p33
aVEverything in the kitchen was salvaged.
p34
aVThere's a 1952 O'Keefe & Merritt stove,
p35
aVif you like to cook \u2014 cool stove.
p36
aVThis is going up into the turret.
p37
aVI got that staircase for 20 dollars,
p38
aVincluding delivery to my lot.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VThen, looking up in the turret,
p43
aVyou see there are bulges and pokes and sags and so forth.
p44
aVWell, if that ruins your life,
p45
aVwell, then, you shouldn't live there.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VThis is a laundry chute.
p50
aVAnd this right here is a shoe last \u2014
p51
aVthose are those cast-iron things you see at antique shops.
p52
aVSo I had one of those,
p53
aVso I made some low-tech gadgetry, where you just stomp on the shoe last,
p54
aVand then the door flies open and you throw your laundry down.
p55
aVAnd then if you're smart enough, it goes on a basket on top of the washer.
p56
aVIf not, it goes into the toilet.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VThis is a bathtub I made,
p61
aVmade out of scrap two-by-four.
p62
aVStarted with the rim, and then glued and nailed it up into a flat,
p63
aVcorbeled it up and flipped it over,
p64
aVthen did the two profiles on this side.
p65
aVIt's a two-person tub.
p66
aVAfter all, it's not just a question of hygiene,
p67
aVbut there's a possibility of recreation as well.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VThen, this faucet here is just a piece of Osage orange.
p72
aVIt looks a little phallic,
p73
aVbut after all, it's a bathroom.
p74
aa(lp75
V(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VThis is a house based on a Budweiser can.
p78
aVIt doesn't look like a can of beer,
p79
aVbut the design take-offs are absolutely unmistakable:
p80
aVthe barley hops design worked up into the eaves,
p81
aVthen the dentil work comes directly off the can's red, white, blue and silver.
p82
aVThen, these corbels going down underneath the eaves
p83
aVare that little design that comes off the can.
p84
aVI just put a can on a copier and kept enlarging it
p85
aVuntil I got the size I want.
p86
aVThen, on the can it says,
p87
aV"This is the famous Budweiser beer,
p88
aVwe know of no other beer, blah, blah, blah."
p89
aVSo we changed that and put,
p90
aV"This is the famous Budweiser house. We don't know of any other house ..."
p91
aVand so forth and so on.
p92
aVThis is a deadbolt.
p93
aVIt's a fence from a 1930s shaper, which is a very angry woodworking machine.
p94
aVAnd they gave me the fence, but they didn't give me the shaper,
p95
aVso we made a deadbolt out of it.
p96
aVThat'll keep bull elephants out, I promise.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd sure enough, we've had no problems with bull elephants.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VThe shower is intended to simulate a glass of beer.
p105
aVWe've got bubbles going up there, then suds at the top with lumpy tiles.
p106
aVWhere do you get lumpy tiles? Well, of course, you don't.
p107
aVBut I get a lot of toilets, and so you just dispatch a toilet with a hammer,
p108
aVand then you have lumpy tiles.
p109
aVAnd then the faucet is a beer tap.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VThen, this panel of glass is the same panel of glass
p114
aVthat occurs in every middle-class front door in America.
p115
aVWe're getting tired of it. It's kind of clichéd now.
p116
aVIf you put it in the front door, your design fails.
p117
aVSo don't put it in the front door; put it somewhere else.
p118
aVIt's a pretty panel of glass.
p119
aVBut if you put it in the front door,
p120
aVpeople say, "Oh, you're trying to be like those guys,
p121
aVand you didn't make it."
p122
aVSo don't put it there.
p123
aVThen, another bathroom upstairs.
p124
aVThis light up here
p125
aVis the same light that occurs in every middle-class foyer in America.
p126
aVDon't put it in the foyer.
p127
aVPut it in the shower, or in the closet,
p128
aVbut not in the foyer.
p129
aVThen, somebody gave me a bidet, so it got a bidet.
p130
aa(lp131
V(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
VThis little house here,
p134
aVthose branches there are made out of Bois d'arc or Osage orange.
p135
aVThese pictures will keep scrolling as I talk a little bit.
p136
aa(lp137
VIn order to do what I do,
p138
aVyou have to understand what causes waste in the building industry.
p139
aVOur housing has become a commodity,
p140
aVand I'll talk a little bit about that.
p141
aVBut the first cause of waste is probably even buried in our DNA.
p142
aVHuman beings have a need for maintaining consistency
p143
aVof the apperceptive mass.
p144
aVWhat does that mean?
p145
aVWhat it means is, for every perception we have,
p146
aVit needs to tally with the one like it before,
p147
aVor we don't have continuity, and we become a little bit disoriented.
p148
aVSo I can show you an object you've never seen before.
p149
aVOh, that's a cell phone.
p150
aVBut you've never seen this one before.
p151
aVWhat you're doing
p152
aVis sizing up the pattern of structural features,
p153
aVand then you go through your databanks:
p154
aVCell phone. Oh! That's a cell phone.
p155
aVIf I took a bite out of it, you'd go,
p156
aV"Wait a second.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
V"That's not a cell phone.
p161
aVThat's one of those new chocolate cell phones."
p162
aa(lp163
V(Laughter)
p164
aa(lp165
VYou'd have to start a new category,
p166
aVright between cell phones and chocolate.
p167
aa(lp168
V(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VThat's how we process information.
p171
aa(lp172
VYou translate that to the building industry.
p173
aVIf we have a wall of windowpanes and one pane is cracked, we go,
p174
aV"Oh, dear. That's cracked. Let's repair it.
p175
aVLet's take it out and throw it away so nobody can use it
p176
aVand put a new one in."
p177
aVBecause that's what you do with a cracked pane.
p178
aVNever mind that it doesn't affect our lives at all.
p179
aVIt only rattles that expected pattern and unity of structural features.
p180
aVHowever, if we took a small hammer,
p181
aVand we added cracks to all the other windows \u2014
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
Vthen we have a pattern.
p186
aVBecause Gestalt psychology emphasizes recognition of pattern
p187
aVover parts that comprise a pattern.
p188
aVWe'll go, "Ooh, that's nice."
p189
aVSo, that serves me every day.
p190
aVRepetition creates pattern.
p191
aVIf I have 100 of these, 100 of those,
p192
aVit makes no difference what these and those are.
p193
aVIf I can repeat anything, I have the possibility of a pattern,
p194
aVfrom hickory nuts and chicken eggs, shards of glass, branches.
p195
aVIt doesn't make any difference.
p196
aVThat causes a lot of waste in the building industry.
p197
aa(lp198
VThe second cause is,
p199
aVFriedrich Nietzsche, along about 1885,
p200
aVwrote a book titled "The Birth of Tragedy."
p201
aVAnd in there,
p202
aVhe said cultures tend to swing between one of two perspectives:
p203
aVon the one hand, we have an Apollonian perspective,
p204
aVwhich is very crisp and premeditated and intellectualized
p205
aVand perfect.
p206
aVOn the other end of the spectrum, we have a Dionysian perspective,
p207
aVwhich is more given to the passions and intuition,
p208
aVtolerant of organic texture and human gesture.
p209
aVSo the way the Apollonian personality takes a picture or hangs a picture is,
p210
aVthey'll get out a transit
p211
aVand a laser level
p212
aVand a micrometer.
p213
aV"OK, honey. A thousandth of an inch to the left.
p214
aVThat's where we want the picture. Right. Perfect!"
p215
aVPredicated on plumb level, square and centered.
p216
aVThe Dionysian personality takes the picture and goes:
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VThat's the difference.
p221
aVI feature blemish.
p222
aVI feature organic process.
p223
aVDead center John Dewey.
p224
aVApollonian mindset creates mountains of waste.
p225
aVIf something isn't perfect,
p226
aVif it doesn't line up with that premeditated model?
p227
aVDumpster.
p228
aV"Oops. Scratch. Dumpster."
p229
aV"Oops" this, "oops" that. Landfill, landfill, landfill.
p230
aa(lp231
VThe third thing is arguably \u2014
p232
aVThe Industrial Revolution started in the Renaissance
p233
aVwith the rise of humanism,
p234
aVthen got a little jump start along about the French Revolution.
p235
aVBy the middle of the 19th century, it's in full flower.
p236
aVAnd we have dumaflaches and gizmos
p237
aVand contraptions that will do anything
p238
aVthat we, up to that point,
p239
aVhad to do by hand.
p240
aVSo now we have standardized materials.
p241
aVWell, trees don't grow two inches by four inches,
p242
aVeight, ten and twelve feet tall.
p243
aa(lp244
V(Laughter)
p245
aa(lp246
VWe create mountains of waste.
p247
aVAnd they're doing a pretty good job there in the forest,
p248
aVworking all the byproduct of their industry \u2014
p249
aVwith OSB and particle board and so forth and so on \u2014
p250
aVbut it does no good
p251
aVto be responsible at the point of harvest in the forest
p252
aVif consumers are wasting the harvest at the point of consumption.
p253
aVAnd that's what's happening.
p254
aVAnd so if something isn't standard,
p255
aV"Oops, dumpster." "Oops" this. "Oops, warped."
p256
aVIf you buy a two-by-four and it's not straight,
p257
aVyou can take it back.
p258
aV"Oh, I'm so sorry, sir. We'll get you a straight one."
p259
aVWell, I feature all those warped things
p260
aVbecause repetition creates pattern,
p261
aVand it's from a Dionysian perspective.
p262
aa(lp263
VThe fourth thing
p264
aVis labor is disproportionately more expensive than materials.
p265
aVWell, that's just a myth.
p266
aVAnd there's a story:
p267
aVJim Tulles, one of the guys I trained \u2014 I said, "Jim, it's time now.
p268
aVI got a job for you as a foreman on a framing crew. Time for you to go."
p269
aV"Dan, I just don't think I'm ready."
p270
aV"Jim, now it's time. You're the down \u2014 oh!"
p271
aVSo we hired on.
p272
aVAnd he was out there with a tape measure, going through the trash heap,
p273
aVlooking for header material, or the board that goes over a door,
p274
aVthinking he'd impress his boss \u2014 that's how we taught him to do it.
p275
aVThe superintendent walked up and said, "What are you doing?"
p276
aV"Oh, just looking for header material,"
p277
aVwaiting for that kudos.
p278
aVHe said, "I'm not paying you to go through the trash. Get back to work."
p279
aVAnd Jim had the wherewithal to say,
p280
aV"You know, if you were paying me 300 dollars an hour,
p281
aVI can see how you might say that.
p282
aVBut right now, I'm saving you five dollars a minute.
p283
aVDo the math."
p284
aa(lp285
V(Laughter)
p286
aa(lp287
V"Good call, Tulles. From now on, you guys hit this pile first."
p288
aVAnd the irony is that he wasn't very good at math.
p289
aa(lp290
V(Laughter)
p291
aa(lp292
VBut once in a while, you get access to the control room,
p293
aVand then you can kind of mess with the dials.
p294
aVAnd that's what happened there.
p295
aa(lp296
VThe fifth thing is that maybe, after 2,500 years,
p297
aVPlato is still having his way with us in his notion of perfect forms.
p298
aVHe said that we have in our noggin the perfect idea of what we want,
p299
aVand we force environmental resources to accommodate that.
p300
aVSo we all have in our head the perfect house,
p301
aVthe American dream, which is a house,
p302
aVthe dream house.
p303
aVThe problem is we can't afford it.
p304
aVSo we have the American dream look-alike,
p305
aVwhich is a mobile home.
p306
aVNow there's a blight on the planet.
p307
aa(lp308
V(Laughter)
p309
aa(lp310
VIt's a chattel mortgage,
p311
aVjust like furniture, just like a car.
p312
aVYou write the check, and instantly, it depreciates 30 percent.
p313
aVAfter a year, you can't get insurance on everything you have in it,
p314
aVonly on 70 percent.
p315
aVWired with 14-Gauge wire, typically.
p316
aVNothing wrong with that,
p317
aVunless you ask it to do what 12-Gauge wire's supposed to do,
p318
aVand that's what happens.
p319
aVIt out-gasses formaldehyde \u2014
p320
aVso much so that there is a federal law in place
p321
aVto warn new mobile home buyers of the formaldehyde atmosphere danger.
p322
aVAre we just being numbingly stupid?
p323
aVThe walls are this thick.
p324
aVThe whole thing has the structural value of corn.
p325
aa(lp326
V(Laughter)
p327
aa(lp328
V"So ... I thought Palm Harbor Village was over there."
p329
aV"No, no. We had a wind last night.
p330
aVIt's gone now."
p331
aa(lp332
V(Laughter)
p333
aa(lp334
VThen when they degrade, what do you do with them?
p335
aa(lp336
VNow, all that \u2014
p337
aVthat Apollonian, Platonic model \u2014
p338
aVis what the building industry is predicated on,
p339
aVand there are a number of things that exacerbate that.
p340
aVOne is that all the professionals,
p341
aVall the tradesmen, vendors,
p342
aVinspectors, engineers, architects
p343
aVall think like this.
p344
aVAnd then it works its way back to the consumer,
p345
aVwho demands the same model.
p346
aVIt's a self-fulfilling prophecy. We can't get out of it.
p347
aVThen here come the marketeers and the advertisers.
p348
aV"Woo. Woo-hoo."
p349
aVWe buy stuff we didn't know we needed.
p350
aVAll we have to do is look at what one company did
p351
aVwith carbonated prune juice.
p352
aVHow disgusting.
p353
aa(lp354
V(Laughter)
p355
aa(lp356
VBut you know what they did?
p357
aVThey hooked a metaphor into it and said, "I drink Dr. Pepper ..."
p358
aVAnd pretty soon, we're swilling that stuff by the lake-ful,
p359
aVby the billions of gallons.
p360
aVIt doesn't even have real prunes! Doesn't even keep you regular.
p361
aa(lp362
V(Laughter)
p363
aa(lp364
VMy oh my, that makes it worse.
p365
aVAnd we get sucked into that faster than anything.
p366
aa(lp367
VThen, a man named Jean-Paul Sartre wrote a book
p368
aVtitled "Being and Nothingness."
p369
aVIt's a pretty quick read. You can snap through it in maybe \u2014
p370
aa(lp371
V(Laughter)
p372
aa(lp373
Vmaybe two years,
p374
aVif you read eight hours a day.
p375
aVIn there, he talked about the divided self.
p376
aVHe said human beings act differently when they know they're alone
p377
aVthan when they know somebody else is around.
p378
aVSo if I'm eating spaghetti, and I know I'm alone,
p379
aVI can eat like a backhoe.
p380
aVI can wipe my mouth on my sleeve, napkin on the table,
p381
aVchew with my mouth open, make little noises,
p382
aVscratch wherever I want.
p383
aa(lp384
V(Laughter)
p385
aa(lp386
VBut as soon as you walk in,
p387
aVI go, "Oops! Lil' spaghetti sauce there."
p388
aVNapkin in my lap, half-bites,
p389
aVchew with my mouth closed, no scratching.
p390
aVNow, what I'm doing is fulfilling your expectations
p391
aVof how I should live my life.
p392
aVI feel that expectation,
p393
aVand so I accommodate it,
p394
aVand I'm living my life according to what you expect me to do.
p395
aVThat happens in the building industry as well.
p396
aVThat's why all subdivisions look the same.
p397
aVSometimes, we even have these formalized cultural expectations.
p398
aVI'll bet all your shoes match.
p399
aVSure enough, we all buy into that ...
p400
aa(lp401
V(Laughter)
p402
aa(lp403
VAnd with gated communities,
p404
aVwe have a formalized expectation,
p405
aVwith a homeowners' association.
p406
aVSometimes those guys are Nazis,
p407
aVmy oh my.
p408
aVThat exacerbates and continues this model.
p409
aa(lp410
VThe last thing is gregariousness.
p411
aVHuman beings are a social species.
p412
aVWe like to hang together in groups,
p413
aVjust like wildebeests, just like lions.
p414
aVWildebeests don't hang with lions,
p415
aVbecause lions eat wildebeests.
p416
aVHuman beings are like that.
p417
aVWe do what that group does
p418
aVthat we're trying to identify with.
p419
aVYou see this in junior high a lot.
p420
aVThose kids, they'll work all summer long \u2014 kill themselves \u2014
p421
aVso that they can afford one pair of designer jeans.
p422
aVSo along about September,
p423
aVthey can stride in and go,
p424
aV"I'm important today. See? Don't touch my designer jeans!
p425
aVI see you don't have designer jeans.
p426
aVYou're not one of the beautiful \u2014 See, I'm one of the beautiful people.
p427
aVSee my jeans?"
p428
aVRight there is reason enough to have uniforms.
p429
aVAnd so that happens in the building industry as well.
p430
aa(lp431
VWe have confused Maslow's hierarchy of needs,
p432
aVjust a little bit.
p433
aVOn the bottom tier, we have basic needs:
p434
aVshelter, clothing, food, water, mating and so forth.
p435
aVSecond: security. Third: relationships.
p436
aVFourth: status, self-esteem \u2014 that is, vanity \u2014
p437
aVand we're taking vanity and shoving it down here.
p438
aVAnd so we end up
p439
aVwith vain decisions,
p440
aVand we can't even afford our mortgage.
p441
aVWe can't afford to eat anything except beans;
p442
aa(lp443
Vthat is, our housing has become a commodity.
p444
aVAnd it takes a little bit of nerve
p445
aVto dive into those primal,
p446
aVterrifying parts of ourselves
p447
aVand make our own decisions
p448
aVand not make our housing a commodity,
p449
aVbut make it something that bubbles up from seminal sources.
p450
aVThat takes a little bit of nerve,
p451
aVand, darn it, once in a while, you fail.
p452
aVBut that's okay.
p453
aVIf failure destroys you,
p454
aVthen you can't do this.
p455
aVI fail all the time, every day,
p456
aVand I've had some whopping failures, I promise \u2014
p457
aVbig, public, humiliating, embarrassing failures.
p458
aa(lp459
VEverybody points and laughs,
p460
aVand they say, "He tried it a fifth time, and it still didn't work!
p461
aVWhat a moron!"
p462
aVEarly on, contractors come by and say,
p463
aV"Dan, you're a cute little bunny,
p464
aVbut you know, this just isn't going to work.
p465
aVWhat don't you do this? Why don't you do that?"
p466
aVAnd your instinct is to say,
p467
aV"Well, why don't you suck an egg?"
p468
aa(lp469
V(Laughter)
p470
aa(lp471
VBut you don't say that,
p472
aVbecause they're the guys you're targeting.
p473
aa(lp474
VAnd so what we've done \u2014
p475
aVand this isn't just in housing; it's in clothing and food
p476
aVand our transportation needs, our energy \u2014
p477
aVwe sprawl just a little bit.
p478
aVAnd when I get a little bit of press,
p479
aVI hear from people all over the world.
p480
aVAnd we may have invented excess,
p481
aVbut the problem of waste is worldwide.
p482
aVWe're in trouble.
p483
aVAnd I don't wear ammo belts crisscrossing my chest
p484
aVand a red bandana.
p485
aVBut we're clearly in trouble.
p486
aVAnd what we need to do is reconnect
p487
aVwith those really primal parts of ourselves
p488
aVand make some decisions and say,
p489
aV"You know, I think I would like to put CDs across the wall there.
p490
aVWhat do you think, honey?"
p491
aVIf it doesn't work, take it down.
p492
aVWhat we need to do is reconnect with who we really are,
p493
aVand that's thrilling indeed.
p494
aa(lp495
VThank you very much.

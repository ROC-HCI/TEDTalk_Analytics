VEverything is covered in invisible ecosystems
p5
aVmade of tiny lifeforms: bacteria, viruses and fungi.
p6
aVOur desks, our computers, our pencils, our buildings
p7
aVall harbor resident microbial landscapes.
p8
aVAs we design these things, we could be thinking
p9
aVabout designing these invisible worlds,
p10
aVand also thinking about how they interact
p11
aVwith our personal ecosystems.
p12
aa(lp13
VOur bodies are home to trillions of microbes,
p14
aVand these creatures define who we are.
p15
aVThe microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your moods.
p16
aVThe microbes on your skin can help boost your immune system.
p17
aVThe microbes in your mouth can freshen your breath,
p18
aVor not,
p19
aVand the key thing is that our personal ecosystems
p20
aVinteract with ecosystems on everything we touch.
p21
aVSo, for example, when you touch a pencil,
p22
aVmicrobial exchange happens.
p23
aa(lp24
VIf we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings,
p25
aVthis opens a path to influencing
p26
aVour health in unprecedented ways.
p27
aa(lp28
VI get asked all of the time from people,
p29
aV"Is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems?"
p30
aVAnd I believe the answer is yes.
p31
aVI think we're doing it right now,
p32
aVbut we're doing it unconsciously.
p33
aVI'm going to share data with you
p34
aVfrom one aspect of my research focused on architecture
p35
aVthat demonstrates how, through both conscious
p36
aVand unconscious design,
p37
aVwe're impacting these invisible worlds.
p38
aa(lp39
VThis is the Lillis Business Complex at the University of Oregon,
p40
aVand I worked with a team of architects and biologists
p41
aVto sample over 300 rooms in this building.
p42
aVWe wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building,
p43
aVand to do this, we sampled dust.
p44
aVFrom the dust, we pulled out bacterial cells,
p45
aVbroke them open, and compared their gene sequences.
p46
aVThis means that people in my group
p47
aVwere doing a lot of vacuuming during this project.
p48
aVThis is a picture of Tim, who,
p49
aVright when I snapped this picture, reminded me,
p50
aVhe said, "Jessica, the last lab group I worked in
p51
aVI was doing fieldwork in the Costa Rican rainforest,
p52
aVand things have changed dramatically for me."
p53
aa(lp54
VSo I'm going to show you now first what we found in the offices,
p55
aVand we're going to look at the data through a visualization tool
p56
aVthat I've been working on in partnership with Autodesk.
p57
aVThe way that you look at this data is,
p58
aVfirst, look around the outside of the circle.
p59
aVYou'll see broad bacterial groups,
p60
aVand if you look at the shape of this pink lobe,
p61
aVit tells you something about the relative abundance of each group.
p62
aVSo at 12 o'clock, you'll see that offices have a lot of
p63
aValphaproteobacteria, and at one o'clock
p64
aVyou'll see that bacilli are relatively rare.
p65
aa(lp66
VLet's take a look at what's going on in different space types in this building.
p67
aVIf you look inside the restrooms,
p68
aVthey all have really similar ecosystems,
p69
aVand if you were to look inside the classrooms,
p70
aVthose also have similar ecosystems.
p71
aVBut if you look across these space types,
p72
aVyou can see that they're fundamentally different
p73
aVfrom one another.
p74
aVI like to think of bathrooms like a tropical rainforest.
p75
aVI told Tim, "If you could just see the microbes,
p76
aVit's kind of like being in Costa Rica. Kind of."
p77
aVAnd I also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland.
p78
aa(lp79
VThis perspective is a really powerful one for designers,
p80
aVbecause you can bring on principles of ecology,
p81
aVand a really important principle of ecology is dispersal,
p82
aVthe way organisms move around.
p83
aVWe know that microbes are dispersed around by people
p84
aVand by air.
p85
aVSo the very first thing we wanted to do in this building
p86
aVwas look at the air system.
p87
aVMechanical engineers design air handling units
p88
aVto make sure that people are comfortable,
p89
aVthat the air flow and temperature is just right.
p90
aVThey do this using principles of physics and chemistry,
p91
aVbut they could also be using biology.
p92
aVIf you look at the microbes
p93
aVin one of the air handling units in this building,
p94
aVyou'll see that they're all very similar to one another.
p95
aVAnd if you compare this to the microbes
p96
aVin a different air handling unit,
p97
aVyou'll see that they're fundamentally different.
p98
aVThe rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago,
p99
aVand what that means is that mechanical engineers
p100
aVare like eco-engineers, and they have the ability
p101
aVto structure biomes in this building the way that they want to.
p102
aa(lp103
VAnother facet of how microbes get around is by people,
p104
aVand designers often cluster rooms together
p105
aVto facilitate interactions among people,
p106
aVor the sharing of ideas, like in labs and in offices.
p107
aVGiven that microbes travel around with people,
p108
aVyou might expect to see rooms that are close together
p109
aVhave really similar biomes.
p110
aVAnd that is exactly what we found.
p111
aVIf you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another,
p112
aVthey have very similar ecosystems,
p113
aVbut if you go to an office
p114
aVthat is a farther walking distance away,
p115
aVthe ecosystem is fundamentally different.
p116
aVAnd when I see the power that dispersal has
p117
aVon these biogeographic patterns,
p118
aVit makes me think that it's possible
p119
aVto tackle really challenging problems,
p120
aVlike hospital-acquired infections.
p121
aVI believe this has got to be, in part,
p122
aVa building ecology problem.
p123
aa(lp124
VAll right, I'm going to tell you one more story about this building.
p125
aVI am collaborating with Charlie Brown.
p126
aVHe's an architect,
p127
aVand Charlie is deeply concerned about global climate change.
p128
aVHe's dedicated his life to sustainable design.
p129
aVWhen he met me and realized that it was possible for him
p130
aVto study in a quantitative way
p131
aVhow his design choices impacted
p132
aVthe ecology and biology of this building,
p133
aVhe got really excited, because it added a new dimension to what he did.
p134
aVHe went from thinking just about energy
p135
aVto also starting to think about human health.
p136
aVHe helped design some of the air handling systems
p137
aVin this building and the way it was ventilated.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo what I'm first going to show you is
p140
aVair that we sampled outside of the building.
p141
aVWhat you're looking at is a signature of bacterial communities
p142
aVin the outdoor air, and how they vary over time.
p143
aVNext I'm going to show you what happened
p144
aVwhen we experimentally manipulated classrooms.
p145
aVWe blocked them off at night
p146
aVso that they got no ventilation.
p147
aVA lot of buildings are operated this way,
p148
aVprobably where you work,
p149
aVand companies do this to save money on their energy bill.
p150
aVWhat we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant
p151
aVuntil Saturday, when we opened the vents up again.
p152
aVWhen you walked into those rooms,
p153
aVthey smelled really bad,
p154
aVand our data suggests that it had something to do with
p155
aVleaving behind the airborne bacterial soup
p156
aVfrom people the day before.
p157
aVContrast this to rooms
p158
aVthat were designed using a sustainable passive design strategy
p159
aVwhere air came in from the outside through louvers.
p160
aVIn these rooms, the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well,
p161
aVand when Charlie saw this, he got really excited.
p162
aVHe felt like he had made a good choice
p163
aVwith the design process
p164
aVbecause it was both energy efficient
p165
aVand it washed away the building's resident microbial landscape.
p166
aa(lp167
VThe examples that I just gave you are about architecture,
p168
aVbut they're relevant to the design of anything.
p169
aVImagine designing with the kinds of microbes that we want
p170
aVin a plane
p171
aVor on a phone.
p172
aa(lp173
VThere's a new microbe, I just discovered it.
p174
aVIt's called BLIS, and it's been shown
p175
aVto both ward off pathogens
p176
aVand give you good breath.
p177
aVWouldn't it be awesome if we all had BLIS on our phones?
p178
aa(lp179
VA conscious approach to design,
p180
aVI'm calling it bioinformed design,
p181
aVand I think it's possible.
p182
aa(lp183
VThank you.

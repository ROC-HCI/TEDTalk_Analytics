VPenelope Jagessar Chaffer: I was going to ask if there's a doctor in the house.
p5
aVNo, I'm just joking.
p6
aVIt's interesting, because it was six years ago
p7
aVwhen I was pregnant with my first child
p8
aVthat I discovered
p9
aVthat the most commonly used preservative
p10
aVin baby care products
p11
aVmimics estrogen
p12
aVwhen it gets into the human body.
p13
aVNow it's very easy actually
p14
aVto get a chemical compound from products
p15
aVinto the human body through the skin.
p16
aVAnd these preservatives had been found
p17
aVin breast cancer tumors.
p18
aa(lp19
VThat was the start of my journey
p20
aVto make this film, "Toxic Baby."
p21
aVAnd it doesn't take much time
p22
aVto discover some really astonishing statistics
p23
aVwith this issue.
p24
aVOne is that you and I all have
p25
aVbetween 30 to 50,000 chemicals
p26
aVin our bodies
p27
aVthat our grandparents didn't have.
p28
aVAnd many of these chemicals
p29
aVare now linked to the skyrocketing incidents
p30
aVof chronic childhood disease
p31
aVthat we're seeing across industrialized nations.
p32
aVI'll show you some statistics.
p33
aVSo for example, in the United Kingdom,
p34
aVthe incidence of childhood leukemia
p35
aVhas risen by 20 percent just in a generation.
p36
aVVery similar statistic for childhood cancer in the U.S.
p37
aVIn Canada, we're now looking at one in 10 Canadian children with asthma.
p38
aVThat's a four-fold increase.
p39
aa(lp40
VAgain, similar story around the world.
p41
aVIn the United States,
p42
aVprobably the most astonishing statistic
p43
aVis a 600 percent increase
p44
aVin autism and autistic spectrum disorders
p45
aVand other learning disabilities.
p46
aVAgain, we're seeing that trend
p47
aVacross Europe, across North America.
p48
aVAnd in Europe,
p49
aVthere's certain parts of Europe,
p50
aVwhere we're seeing a four-fold increase
p51
aVin certain genital birth defects.
p52
aVInterestingly, one of those birth defects
p53
aVhas seen a 200 percent increase in the U.S.
p54
aVSo a real skyrocketing
p55
aVof chronic childhood disease
p56
aVthat includes other things
p57
aVlike obesity and juvenile diabetes,
p58
aVpremature puberty.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo it's interesting for me,
p61
aVwhen I'm looking for someone who can really talk to me
p62
aVand talk to an audience about these things,
p63
aVthat probably one of the most important people in the world
p64
aVwho can discuss toxicity in babies
p65
aVis expert in frogs.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VTyrone Hayes: It was a surprise to me as well
p70
aVthat I would be talking about pesticides,
p71
aVthat I'd be talking about public health,
p72
aVbecause, in fact, I never thought I would do anything useful.
p73
aV(Laughter)
p74
aVFrogs.
p75
aVIn fact, my involvement in the whole pesticide issue
p76
aVwas sort of a surprise as well
p77
aVwhen I was approached by the largest chemical company in the world
p78
aVand they asked me if I would evaluate
p79
aVhow atrazine affected amphibians, or my frogs.
p80
aVIt turns out, atrazine is the largest selling product
p81
aVfor the largest chemical company in the world.
p82
aVIt's the number one contaminant
p83
aVof groundwater, drinking water, rain water.
p84
aVIn 2003, after my studies, it was banned in the European Union,
p85
aVbut in that same year,
p86
aVthe United States EPA re-registered the compound.
p87
aa(lp88
VWe were a bit surprised when we found out
p89
aVthat when we exposed frogs
p90
aVto very low levels of atrazine \u2014 0.1 parts per billion \u2014
p91
aVthat it produced animals that look like this.
p92
aVThese are the dissected gonads of an animal
p93
aVthat has two testes, two ovaries,
p94
aVanother large testis, more ovaries,
p95
aVwhich is not normal ...
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aVeven for amphibians.
p98
aVIn some cases, another species like the North American Leopard Frog
p99
aVshowed that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testes.
p100
aVAnd you can see these large, yolked-up eggs
p101
aVbursting through the surface of this male's testes.
p102
aVNow my wife tells me, and I'm sure Penelope can as well,
p103
aVthat there's nothing more painful than childbirth \u2014
p104
aVwhich that I'll never experience, I can't really argue that \u2014
p105
aVbut I would guess that a dozen chicken eggs in my testicle
p106
aVwould probably be somewhere in the top five.
p107
aa(lp108
V(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VIn recent studies that we've published,
p111
aVwe've shown that some of these animals when they're exposed to atrazine,
p112
aVsome of the males grow up
p113
aVand completely become females.
p114
aVSo these are actually two brothers consummating a relationship.
p115
aVAnd not only do these genetic males mate with other males,
p116
aVthey actually have the capacity to lay eggs
p117
aVeven though they're genetic males.
p118
aVWhat we proposed,
p119
aVand what we've now generated support for,
p120
aVis that what atrazine is doing
p121
aVis wreaking havoc causing a hormone imbalance.
p122
aVNormally the testes should make testosterone,
p123
aVthe male hormone.
p124
aVBut what atrazine does is it turns on an enzyme,
p125
aVthe machinery if you will, aromatase,
p126
aVthat converts testosterone into estrogen.
p127
aVAnd as a result, these exposed males
p128
aVlose their testosterone, they're chemically castrated,
p129
aVand they're subsequently feminized
p130
aVbecause now they're making the female hormone.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow this is what brought me to the human-related issues.
p133
aVBecause it turns out
p134
aVthat the number one cancer in women, breast cancer,
p135
aVis regulated by estrogen and by this enzyme aromatase.
p136
aVSo when you develop a cancerous cell in your breast,
p137
aVaromatase converts androgens into estrogens,
p138
aVand that estrogen turns on or promotes
p139
aVthe growth of that cancer
p140
aVso that it turns into a tumor and spreads.
p141
aVIn fact, this aromatase is so important in breast cancer
p142
aVthat the latest treatment for breast cancer
p143
aVis a chemical called letrozole,
p144
aVwhich blocks aromatase, blocks estrogen,
p145
aVso that if you developed a mutated cell, it doesn't grow into a tumor.
p146
aa(lp147
VNow what's interesting is, of course,
p148
aVthat we're still using 80 million pounds of atrazine,
p149
aVthe number one contaminant in drinking water, that does the opposite \u2014
p150
aVturns on aromatase, increases estrogen
p151
aVand promotes tumors in rats
p152
aVand is associated with tumors, breast cancer, in humans.
p153
aVWhat's interesting is, in fact,
p154
aVthe same company that sold us 80 million pounds of atrazine,
p155
aVthe breast cancer promoter,
p156
aVnow sells us the blocker \u2014 the exact same company.
p157
aVAnd so I find it interesting
p158
aVthat instead of treating this disease
p159
aVby preventing exposure to the chemicals that promote it,
p160
aVwe simply respond
p161
aVby putting more chemicals into the environment.
p162
aa(lp163
VPJC: So speaking of estrogen,
p164
aVone of the other compounds that Tyrone talks about in the film
p165
aVis something called bisphenol A, BPA,
p166
aVwhich has been in the news recently.
p167
aVIt's a plasticizer.
p168
aVIt's a compound that's found in polycarbonate plastic,
p169
aVwhich is what baby bottles are made out of.
p170
aVAnd what's interesting about BPA
p171
aVis that it's such a potent estrogen
p172
aVthat it was actually once considered for use
p173
aVas a synthetic estrogen in hormone placement therapy.
p174
aVAnd there have been many, many, many studies that have shown
p175
aVthat BPA leaches from babies' bottles
p176
aVinto the formula, into the milk,
p177
aVand therefore into the babies.
p178
aVSo we're dosing our babies,
p179
aVour newborns, our infants,
p180
aVwith a synthetic estrogen.
p181
aa(lp182
VNow two weeks ago or so,
p183
aVthe European Union passed a law
p184
aVbanning the use of BPA
p185
aVin babies' bottles and sippy cups.
p186
aVAnd for those of you who are not parents,
p187
aVsippy cups are those little plastic things
p188
aVthat your child graduates to after using bottles.
p189
aVBut just two weeks before that,
p190
aVthe U.S. Senate refused to even debate
p191
aVthe banning of BPA
p192
aVin babies' bottles and sippy cups.
p193
aVSo it really makes you realize
p194
aVthe onus on parents
p195
aVto have to look at this and regulate this and police this
p196
aVin their own lives
p197
aVand how astonishing that is.
p198
aa(lp199
V(Video) PJC: With many plastic baby bottles
p200
aVnow proven to leak the chemical bisphenol A,
p201
aVit really shows how sometimes
p202
aVit is only a parent's awareness
p203
aVthat stands between chemicals and our children.
p204
aVThe baby bottle scenario proves
p205
aVthat we can prevent unnecessary exposure.
p206
aVHowever, if we parents are unaware,
p207
aVwe are leaving our children
p208
aVto fend for themselves.
p209
aa(lp210
VTH: And what Penelope says here
p211
aVis even more true.
p212
aVFor those of you who don't know, we're in the middle of the sixth mass extinction.
p213
aVScientists agree now.
p214
aVWe are losing species from the Earth
p215
aVfaster than the dinosaurs disappeared,
p216
aVand leading that loss are amphibians.
p217
aV80 percent of all amphibians
p218
aVare threatened and in come decline.
p219
aVAnd I believe, many scientists believe
p220
aVthat pesticides are an important part of that decline.
p221
aVIn part, amphibians are good indicators and more sensitive
p222
aVbecause they don't have protection from contaminants in the water \u2014
p223
aVno eggshells, no membranes
p224
aVand no placenta.
p225
aVIn fact, our invention \u2014 by "our" I mean we mammals \u2014
p226
aVone of our big inventions was the placenta.
p227
aVBut we also start out as aquatic organisms.
p228
aa(lp229
VBut it turns out that this ancient structure
p230
aVthat separates us from other animals, the placenta,
p231
aVcannot evolve or adapt fast enough
p232
aVbecause of the rate that we're generating new chemicals
p233
aVthat it's never seen before.
p234
aVThe evidence of that is that studies in rats, again with atrazine,
p235
aVshow that the hormone imbalance atrazine generates causes abortion.
p236
aVBecause maintaining a pregnancy is dependent on hormones.
p237
aa(lp238
VOf those rats that don't abort,
p239
aVatrazine causes prostate disease
p240
aVin the pups so the sons
p241
aVare born with an old man's disease.
p242
aVOf those that don't abort,
p243
aVatrazine causes impaired mammary, or breast, development
p244
aVin the exposed daughters in utero,
p245
aVso that their breast don't develop properly.
p246
aVAnd as a result, when those rats grow up,
p247
aVtheir pups experience retarded growth and development
p248
aVbecause they can't make enough milk to nourish their pups.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo the pup you see on the bottom is affected by atrazine
p251
aVthat its grandmother was exposed to.
p252
aVAnd given the life of many of these chemicals,
p253
aVgenerations, years, dozens of years,
p254
aVthat means that we right now
p255
aVare affecting the health
p256
aVof our grandchildren's grandchildren
p257
aVby things that we're putting into the environment today.
p258
aa(lp259
VAnd this is not just philosophical, it's already known,
p260
aVthat chemicals like diethylstilbestrol and estrogen,
p261
aVPCBs, DDT
p262
aVcross the placenta
p263
aVand effectively determine
p264
aVthe likelihood of developing breast cancer
p265
aVand obesity and diabetes
p266
aValready when the baby's in the womb.
p267
aVIn addition to that, after the baby's born,
p268
aVour other unique invention as mammals
p269
aVis that we nourish our offspring after they're born.
p270
aVWe already know that chemicals
p271
aVlike DDT and DES and atrazine
p272
aVcan also pass over into milk,
p273
aVagain, affecting our babies
p274
aVeven after their born.
p275
aa(lp276
VPJC: So when Tyrone tells me
p277
aVthat the placenta is an ancient organ,
p278
aVI'm thinking, how do I demonstrate that?
p279
aVHow do you show that?
p280
aVAnd it's interesting when you make a film like this,
p281
aVbecause you're stuck trying to visualize science
p282
aVthat there's no visualization for.
p283
aVAnd I have to take a little bit of artistic license.
p284
aa(lp285
V(Video) (Ringing)
p286
aVOld man: Placenta control.
p287
aVWhat is it?
p288
aVOh what?
p289
aV(Snoring)
p290
aV(Honk)
p291
aVPuffuffuff, what?
p292
aVPerflourooctanoic acid.
p293
aVBlimey.
p294
aVNever heard of it.
p295
aVPJC: And neither had I actually
p296
aVbefore I started making this film.
p297
aVAnd so when you realize that chemicals can pass the placenta
p298
aVand go into your unborn child,
p299
aVit made me start to think,
p300
aVwhat would my fetus say to me?
p301
aVWhat would our unborn children say to us
p302
aVwhen they have an exposure
p303
aVthat's happening everyday, day after day?
p304
aa(lp305
V(Music)
p306
aa(lp307
V(Video) Child: Today,
p308
aVI had some octyphenols,
p309
aVsome artificial musks
p310
aVand some bisphenol A.
p311
aVHelp me.
p312
aa(lp313
VPJC: It's a very profound notion
p314
aVto know that we as women
p315
aVare at the vanguard of this.
p316
aVThis is our issue,
p317
aVbecause we collect these compounds our entire life
p318
aVand then we end up dumping it and dumping them
p319
aVinto our unborn children.
p320
aVWe are in effect
p321
aVpolluting our children.
p322
aVAnd this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago
p323
aVwhen I found out I was pregnant
p324
aVand the first scan revealed
p325
aVthat my baby had a birth defect
p326
aVassociated with exposure
p327
aVto estrogenic chemicals in the womb
p328
aVand the second scan
p329
aVrevealed no heartbeat.
p330
aa(lp331
VSo my child's death, my baby's death,
p332
aVreally brought home the resonance of what I was trying to make in this film.
p333
aVAnd it's sometimes a weird place
p334
aVwhen the communicator becomes part of the story,
p335
aVwhich is not what you originally intend.
p336
aVAnd so when Tyrone talks about
p337
aVthe fetus being trapped in a contaminated environment,
p338
aVthis is my contaminated environment.
p339
aVThis is my toxic baby.
p340
aVAnd that's something
p341
aVthat's just profound and sad,
p342
aVbut astonishing
p343
aVbecause so many of us don't actually know this.
p344
aa(lp345
VTH: One of this things that's exciting and appropriate
p346
aVfor me to be here at TEDWomen
p347
aVis that, well, I think it was summed up best last night at dinner
p348
aVwhen someone said, "Turn to the man at your table and tell them,
p349
aV'When the revolution starts, we've got your back.'"
p350
aVThe truth is, women,
p351
aVyou've had our back on this issue for a very long time,
p352
aVstarting with Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring"
p353
aVto Theo Colborn's "Our Stolen Future"
p354
aVto Sandra Steingraber's books
p355
aV"Living Downstream" and "Having Faith."
p356
aVAnd perhaps it's the connection to our next generation \u2014
p357
aVlike my wife and my beautiful daughter here about 13 years ago \u2014
p358
aVperhaps it's that connection
p359
aVthat makes women activists
p360
aVin this particular area.
p361
aa(lp362
VBut for the men here, I want to say
p363
aVit's not just women and children that are at risk.
p364
aVAnd the frogs that are exposed to atrazine,
p365
aVthe testes are full of holes and spaces,
p366
aVbecause the hormone imbalance,
p367
aVinstead of allowing sperm to be generated,
p368
aVsuch as in the testis here,
p369
aVthe testicular tubules end up empty
p370
aVand fertility goes down by as much as 50 percent.
p371
aVIt's not just my work in amphibians,
p372
aVbut similar work has been shown in fish in Europe,
p373
aVholes in the testes and absence of sperm in reptiles in a group from South America
p374
aVand in rats, an absence of sperm
p375
aVin the testicular tubules as well.
p376
aVAnd of course, we don't do these experiments in humans,
p377
aVbut just by coincidence,
p378
aVmy colleague has shown
p379
aVthat men who have low sperm count, low semen quality
p380
aVhave significantly more atrazine in their urine.
p381
aa(lp382
VThese are just men who live
p383
aVin an agricultural community.
p384
aVMen who actually work in agriculture
p385
aVhave much higher levels of atrazine.
p386
aVAnd the men who actually apply atrazine
p387
aVhave even more atrazine in their urine,
p388
aVup to levels that are 24,000 times what we know to be active
p389
aVare present in the urine of these men.
p390
aVOf course, most of them, 90 percent are Mexican, Mexican-American.
p391
aVAnd it's not just atrazine they're exposed to.
p392
aVThey're exposed to chemicals like chloropicrin,
p393
aVwhich was originally used as a nerve gas.
p394
aVAnd many of these workers
p395
aVhave life expectancies of only 50.
p396
aa(lp397
VIt shouldn't come to any surprise that the things that happen in wildlife
p398
aVare also a warning to us,
p399
aVjust like Rachel Carson and others have warned.
p400
aVAs evident in this slide from Lake Nabugabo in Uganda,
p401
aVthe agricultural runoff from this crop,
p402
aVwhich goes into these buckets,
p403
aVis the sole source of drinking, cooking and bathing water for this village.
p404
aVNow if I told the men in this village
p405
aVthat the frogs have pour immune function
p406
aVand eggs developing in their testes,
p407
aVthe connection between environmental health and public health
p408
aVwould be clear.
p409
aVYou would not drink water that you knew was having this kind of impact
p410
aVon the wildlife that lived in it.
p411
aVThe problem is, in my village, Oakland,
p412
aVin most of our villages,
p413
aVwe don't see that connection.
p414
aVWe turn on the faucet, the water comes out, we assume it's safe,
p415
aVand we assume that we are masters of our environment,
p416
aVrather than being part of it.
p417
aa(lp418
VPJC: So it doesn't take much to realize
p419
aVthat actually this is an environmental issue.
p420
aVAnd I kept thinking over and over again
p421
aVthis question.
p422
aVWe know so much about global warming and climate change,
p423
aVand yet, we have no concept
p424
aVof what I've been calling internal environmentalism.
p425
aVWe know what we're putting out there,
p426
aVwe have a sense of those repercussions,
p427
aVbut we are so ignorant of this sense
p428
aVof what happens when we put things, or things are put
p429
aVinto our bodies.
p430
aa(lp431
VAnd it's my feeling
p432
aVand it's my urging being here
p433
aVto know that, as we women move forward
p434
aVas the communicators of this,
p435
aVbut also as the ones who carry that burden
p436
aVof carrying the children, bearing the children,
p437
aVwe hold most of the buying power in the household,
p438
aVis that it's going to be us moving forward
p439
aVto carry the work of Tyrone and other scientists around the world.
p440
aVAnd my urging is
p441
aVthat when we think about environmental issues
p442
aVthat we remember that it's not just about melting glaciers and ice caps,
p443
aVbut it's also about our children as well.
p444
aa(lp445
VThank you.

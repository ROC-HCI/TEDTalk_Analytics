VWhat I'd like to do is talk to you a little bit about fear
p5
aVand the cost of fear
p6
aVand the age of fear from which we are now emerging.
p7
aVI would like you to feel comfortable with my doing that
p8
aVby letting you know that I know something about fear and anxiety.
p9
aVI'm a Jewish guy from New Jersey.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VI could worry before I could walk.
p14
aa(lp15
V(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VPlease, applaud that.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Applause)
p20
aa(lp21
VThank you.
p22
aa(lp23
VBut I also grew up in a time where there was something to fear.
p24
aVWe were brought out in the hall when I was a little kid
p25
aVand taught how to put our coats over our heads
p26
aVto protect us from global thermonuclear war.
p27
aVNow even my seven-year-old brain knew that wasn't going to work.
p28
aVBut I also knew
p29
aVthat global thermonuclear war was something to be concerned with.
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd yet, despite the fact that we lived for 50 years
p32
aVwith the threat of such a war,
p33
aVthe response of our government and of our society
p34
aVwas to do wonderful things.
p35
aVWe created the space program in response to that.
p36
aVWe built our highway system in response to that.
p37
aVWe created the Internet in response to that.
p38
aVSo sometimes fear can produce a constructive response.
p39
aVBut sometimes it can produce an un-constructive response.
p40
aa(lp41
VOn September 11, 2001,
p42
aV19 guys took over four airplanes
p43
aVand flew them into a couple of buildings.
p44
aVThey exacted a horrible toll.
p45
aVIt is not for us to minimize what that toll was.
p46
aVBut the response that we had was clearly disproportionate \u2014
p47
aVdisproportionate to the point of verging on the unhinged.
p48
aVWe rearranged the national security apparatus of the United States
p49
aVand of many governments
p50
aVto address a threat that, at the time that those attacks took place,
p51
aVwas quite limited.
p52
aVIn fact, according to our intelligence services,
p53
aVon September 11, 2001,
p54
aVthere were 100 members of core Al-Qaeda.
p55
aVThere were just a few thousand terrorists.
p56
aVThey posed an existential threat
p57
aVto no one.
p58
aa(lp59
VBut we rearranged our entire national security apparatus
p60
aVin the most sweeping way since the end of the Second World War.
p61
aVWe launched two wars.
p62
aVWe spent trillions of dollars.
p63
aVWe suspended our values.
p64
aVWe violated international law.
p65
aVWe embraced torture.
p66
aVWe embraced the idea
p67
aVthat if these 19 guys could do this, anybody could do it.
p68
aVAnd therefore, for the first time in history,
p69
aVwe were seeing everybody as a threat.
p70
aVAnd what was the result of that?
p71
aVSurveillance programs that listened in on the emails and phone calls
p72
aVof entire countries \u2014
p73
aVhundreds of millions of people \u2014
p74
aVsetting aside whether those countries were our allies,
p75
aVsetting aside what our interests were.
p76
aVI would argue that 15 years later,
p77
aVsince today there are more terrorists,
p78
aVmore terrorist attacks, more terrorist casualties \u2014
p79
aVthis by the count of the U.S. State Department \u2014
p80
aVsince today the region from which those attacks emanate
p81
aVis more unstable than at any time in its history,
p82
aVsince the Flood, perhaps,
p83
aVwe have not succeeded in our response.
p84
aa(lp85
VNow you have to ask, where did we go wrong?
p86
aVWhat did we do? What was the mistake that was made?
p87
aVAnd you might say, well look, Washington is a dysfunctional place.
p88
aVThere are political food fights.
p89
aVWe've turned our discourse into a cage match.
p90
aVAnd that's true.
p91
aVBut there are bigger problems, believe it or not, than that dysfunction,
p92
aVeven though I would argue
p93
aVthat dysfunction that makes it impossible to get anything done
p94
aVin the richest and most powerful country in the world
p95
aVis far more dangerous than anything that a group like ISIS could do,
p96
aVbecause it stops us in our tracks and it keeps us from progress.
p97
aa(lp98
VBut there are other problems.
p99
aVAnd the other problems
p100
aVcame from the fact that in Washington and in many capitals right now,
p101
aVwe're in a creativity crisis.
p102
aVIn Washington, in think tanks,
p103
aVwhere people are supposed to be thinking of new ideas,
p104
aVyou don't get bold new ideas,
p105
aVbecause if you offer up a bold new idea,
p106
aVnot only are you attacked on Twitter,
p107
aVbut you will not get confirmed in a government job.
p108
aVBecause we are reactive to the heightened venom of the political debate,
p109
aVyou get governments that have an us-versus-them mentality,
p110
aVtiny groups of people making decisions.
p111
aVWhen you sit in a room with a small group of people making decisions,
p112
aVwhat do you get?
p113
aVYou get groupthink.
p114
aVEverybody has the same worldview,
p115
aVand any view from outside of the group is seen as a threat.
p116
aVThat's a danger.
p117
aVYou also have processes that become reactive to news cycles.
p118
aVAnd so the parts of the U.S. government that do foresight, that look forward,
p119
aVthat do strategy \u2014
p120
aVthe parts in other governments that do this \u2014 can't do it,
p121
aVbecause they're reacting to the news cycle.
p122
aVAnd so we're not looking ahead.
p123
aa(lp124
VOn 9/11, we had a crisis because we were looking the wrong way.
p125
aVToday we have a crisis because, because of 9/11,
p126
aVwe are still looking in the wrong direction,
p127
aVand we know because we see transformational trends on the horizon
p128
aVthat are far more important than what we saw on 9/11;
p129
aVfar more important than the threat posed by these terrorists;
p130
aVfar more important even than the instability that we've got
p131
aVin some areas of the world that are racked by instability today.
p132
aVIn fact, the things that we are seeing in those parts of the world
p133
aVmay be symptoms.
p134
aVThey may be a reaction to bigger trends.
p135
aVAnd if we are treating the symptom and ignoring the bigger trend,
p136
aVthen we've got far bigger problems to deal with.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd so what are those trends?
p139
aVWell, to a group like you,
p140
aVthe trends are apparent.
p141
aVWe are living at a moment in which the very fabric of human society
p142
aVis being rewoven.
p143
aVIf you saw the cover of The Economist a couple of days ago \u2014
p144
aVit said that 80 percent of the people on the planet,
p145
aVby the year 2020, would have a smartphone.
p146
aVThey would have a small computer connected to the Internet in their pocket.
p147
aVIn most of Africa, the cell phone penetration rate is 80 percent.
p148
aVWe passed the point last October
p149
aVwhen there were more mobile cellular devices, SIM cards,
p150
aVout in the world than there were people.
p151
aVWe are within years of a profound moment in our history,
p152
aVwhen effectively every single human being on the planet
p153
aVis going to be part of a man-made system for the first time,
p154
aVable to touch anyone else \u2014
p155
aVtouch them for good, touch them for ill.
p156
aVAnd the changes associated with that are changing the very nature
p157
aVof every aspect of governance and life on the planet
p158
aVin ways that our leaders ought to be thinking about,
p159
aVwhen they're thinking about these immediate threats.
p160
aa(lp161
VOn the security side,
p162
aVwe've come out of a Cold War in which it was too costly to fight a nuclear war,
p163
aVand so we didn't,
p164
aVto a period that I call Cool War, cyber war,
p165
aVwhere the costs of conflict are actually so low, that we may never stop.
p166
aVWe may enter a period of constant warfare,
p167
aVand we know this because we've been in it for several years.
p168
aVAnd yet, we don't have the basic doctrines to guide us in this regard.
p169
aVWe don't have the basic ideas formulated.
p170
aVIf someone attacks us with a cyber attack,
p171
aVdo have the ability to respond with a kinetic attack?
p172
aVWe don't know.
p173
aVIf somebody launches a cyber attack, how do we deter them?
p174
aVWhen China launched a series of cyber attacks,
p175
aVwhat did the U.S. government do?
p176
aVIt said, we're going to indict a few of these Chinese guys,
p177
aVwho are never coming to America.
p178
aVThey're never going to be anywhere near a law enforcement officer
p179
aVwho's going to take them into custody.
p180
aVIt's a gesture \u2014 it's not a deterrent.
p181
aa(lp182
VSpecial forces operators out there in the field today
p183
aVdiscover that small groups of insurgents with cell phones
p184
aVhave access to satellite imagery that once only superpowers had.
p185
aVIn fact, if you've got a cell phone,
p186
aVyou've got access to power that a superpower didn't have,
p187
aVand would have highly classified 10 years ago.
p188
aVIn my cell phone, I have an app that tells me
p189
aVwhere every plane in the world is, and its altitude, and its speed,
p190
aVand what kind of aircraft it is,
p191
aVand where it's going and where it's landing.
p192
aVThey have apps that allow them to know
p193
aVwhat their adversary is about to do.
p194
aVThey're using these tools in new ways.
p195
aVWhen a cafe in Sydney was taken over by a terrorist,
p196
aVhe went in with a rifle...
p197
aVand an iPad.
p198
aVAnd the weapon was the iPad.
p199
aVBecause he captured people, he terrorized them,
p200
aVhe pointed the iPad at them,
p201
aVand then he took the video and he put it on the Internet,
p202
aVand he took over the world's media.
p203
aa(lp204
VBut it doesn't just affect the security side.
p205
aVThe relations between great powers \u2014
p206
aVwe thought we were past the bipolar era.
p207
aVWe thought we were in a unipolar world,
p208
aVwhere all the big issues were resolved.
p209
aVRemember? It was the end of history.
p210
aVBut we're not.
p211
aVWe're now seeing that our basic assumptions about the Internet \u2014
p212
aVthat it was going to connect us, weave society together \u2014
p213
aVare not necessarily true.
p214
aVIn countries like China, you have the Great Firewall of China.
p215
aVYou've got countries saying no, if the Internet happens within our borders
p216
aVwe control it within our borders.
p217
aVWe control the content. We are going to control our security.
p218
aVWe are going to manage that Internet.
p219
aVWe are going to say what can be on it.
p220
aVWe're going to set a different set of rules.
p221
aVNow you might think, well, that's just China.
p222
aVBut it's not just China.
p223
aVIt's China, India, Russia.
p224
aVIt's Saudi Arabia, it's Singapore, it's Brazil.
p225
aVAfter the NSA scandal, the Russians, the Chinese, the Indians, the Brazilians,
p226
aVthey said, let's create a new Internet backbone,
p227
aVbecause we can't be dependent on this other one.
p228
aVAnd so all of a sudden, what do you have?
p229
aVYou have a new bipolar world
p230
aVin which cyber-internationalism,
p231
aVour belief,
p232
aVis challenged by cyber-nationalism,
p233
aVanother belief.
p234
aa(lp235
VWe are seeing these changes everywhere we look.
p236
aVWe are seeing the advent of mobile money.
p237
aVIt's happening in the places you wouldn't expect.
p238
aVIt's happening in Kenya and Tanzania,
p239
aVwhere millions of people who haven't had access to financial services
p240
aVnow conduct all those services on their phones.
p241
aVThere are 2.5 million people who don't have financial service access
p242
aVthat are going to get it soon.
p243
aVA billion of them are going to have the ability to access it
p244
aVon their cell phone soon.
p245
aVIt's not just going to give them the ability to bank.
p246
aVIt's going to change what monetary policy is.
p247
aVIt's going to change what money is.
p248
aVEducation is changing in the same way.
p249
aVHealthcare is changing in the same way.
p250
aVHow government services are delivered is changing in the same way.
p251
aa(lp252
VAnd yet, in Washington, we are debating
p253
aVwhether to call the terrorist group that has taken over Syria and Iraq
p254
aVISIS or ISIL or Islamic State.
p255
aVWe are trying to determine
p256
aVhow much we want to give in a negotiation with the Iranians
p257
aVon a nuclear deal which deals with the technologies of 50 years ago,
p258
aVwhen in fact, we know that the Iranians right now are engaged in cyber war with us
p259
aVand we're ignoring it, partially because businesses are not willing
p260
aVto talk about the attacks that are being waged on them.
p261
aa(lp262
VAnd that gets us to another breakdown
p263
aVthat's crucial,
p264
aVand another breakdown that couldn't be more important to a group like this,
p265
aVbecause the growth of America and real American national security
p266
aVand all of the things that drove progress even during the Cold War,
p267
aVwas a public-private partnership between science, technology and government
p268
aVthat began when Thomas Jefferson sat alone in his laboratory
p269
aVinventing new things.
p270
aVBut it was the canals and railroads and telegraph;
p271
aVit was radar and the Internet.
p272
aVIt was Tang, the breakfast drink \u2014
p273
aVprobably not the most important of those developments.
p274
aVBut what you had was a partnership and a dialogue,
p275
aVand the dialogue has broken down.
p276
aVIt's broken down because in Washington,
p277
aVless government is considered more.
p278
aVIt's broken down because there is, believe it or not,
p279
aVin Washington, a war on science \u2014
p280
aVdespite the fact that in all of human history,
p281
aVevery time anyone has waged a war on science,
p282
aVscience has won.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Applause)
p285
aa(lp286
VBut we have a government that doesn't want to listen,
p287
aVthat doesn't have people at the highest levels
p288
aVthat understand this.
p289
aVIn the nuclear age,
p290
aVwhen there were people in senior national security jobs,
p291
aVthey were expected to speak throw-weight.
p292
aVThey were expected to know the lingo, the vocabulary.
p293
aVIf you went to the highest level of the U.S. government now
p294
aVand said, "Talk to me about cyber, about neuroscience,
p295
aVabout the things that are going to change the world of tomorrow,"
p296
aVyou'd get a blank stare.
p297
aVI know, because when I wrote this book,
p298
aVI talked to 150 people, many from the science and tech side,
p299
aVwho felt like they were being shunted off to the kids' table.
p300
aVMeanwhile, on the tech side,
p301
aVwe have lots of wonderful people creating wonderful things,
p302
aVbut they started in garages and they didn't need the government
p303
aVand they don't want the government.
p304
aVMany of them have a political view that's somewhere between
p305
aVlibertarian and anarchic:
p306
aVleave me alone.
p307
aa(lp308
VBut the world's coming apart.
p309
aVAll of a sudden, there are going to be massive regulatory changes
p310
aVand massive issues associated with conflict
p311
aVand massive issues associated with security and privacy.
p312
aVAnd we haven't even gotten to the next set of issues,
p313
aVwhich are philosophical issues.
p314
aVIf you can't vote, if you can't have a job,
p315
aVif you can't bank, if you can't get health care,
p316
aVif you can't be educated without Internet access,
p317
aVis Internet access a fundamental right that should be written into constitutions?
p318
aVIf Internet access is a fundamental right,
p319
aVis electricity access for the 1.2 billion who don't have access to electricity
p320
aVa fundamental right?
p321
aVThese are fundamental issues. Where are the philosophers?
p322
aVWhere's the dialogue?
p323
aa(lp324
VAnd that brings me to the reason that I'm here.
p325
aVI live in Washington. Pity me.
p326
aa(lp327
V(Laughter)
p328
aa(lp329
VThe dialogue isn't happening there.
p330
aVThese big issues that will change the world,
p331
aVchange national security, change economics,
p332
aVcreate hope, create threats,
p333
aVcan only be resolved when you bring together
p334
aVgroups of people who understand science and technology
p335
aVback together with government.
p336
aVBoth sides need each other.
p337
aVAnd until we recreate that connection,
p338
aVuntil we do what helped America grow and helped other countries grow,
p339
aVthen we are going to grow ever more vulnerable.
p340
aVThe risks associated with 9/11 will not be measured
p341
aVin terms of lives lost by terror attacks
p342
aVor buildings destroyed or trillions of dollars spent.
p343
aVThey'll be measured in terms of the costs of our distraction from critical issues
p344
aVand our inability to get together
p345
aVscientists, technologists, government leaders,
p346
aVat a moment of transformation akin to the beginning of the Renaissance,
p347
aVakin to the beginning of the major transformational eras
p348
aVthat have happened on Earth,
p349
aVand start coming up with, if not the right answers,
p350
aVthen at least the right questions.
p351
aa(lp352
VWe are not there yet,
p353
aVbut discussions like this and groups like you
p354
aVare the places where those questions can be formulated and posed.
p355
aVAnd that's why I believe that groups like TED,
p356
aVdiscussions like this around the planet,
p357
aVare the place where the future of foreign policy, of economic policy,
p358
aVof social policy, of philosophy, will ultimately take place.
p359
aVAnd that's why it's been a pleasure speaking to you.
p360
aa(lp361
VThank you very, very much.

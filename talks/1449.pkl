VI wanted to talk to you today about creative confidence.
p5
aVI'm going to start way back in the third grade
p6
aVat Oakdale School in Barberton, Ohio.
p7
aa(lp8
VI remember one day my best friend Brian was working on a project.
p9
aVHe was making a horse out of the clay our teacher kept under the sink.
p10
aVAnd at one point, one of the girls that was sitting at his table,
p11
aVseeing what he was doing, leaned over and said to him,
p12
aV"That's terrible. That doesn't look anything like a horse."
p13
aVAnd Brian's shoulders sank.
p14
aVAnd he wadded up the clay horse and he threw it back in the bin.
p15
aVI never saw Brian do a project like that ever again.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd I wonder how often that happens, you know?
p18
aVIt seems like when I tell that story of Brian to my class,
p19
aVa lot of them want to come up after class
p20
aVand tell me about their similar experience,
p21
aVhow a teacher shut them down,
p22
aVor how a student was particularly cruel to them.
p23
aVAnd then some kind of opt out of thinking of themselves as creative
p24
aVat that point.
p25
aVAnd I see that opting out that happens in childhood,
p26
aVand it moves in and becomes more ingrained, even,
p27
aVby the time you get to adult life.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo we see a lot of this.
p30
aVWhen we have a workshop
p31
aVor when we have clients in to work with us side by side,
p32
aVeventually we get to the point in the process
p33
aVthat's kind of fuzzy or unconventional.
p34
aVAnd eventually, these big-shot executives whip out their BlackBerrys
p35
aVand they say they have to make really important phone calls,
p36
aVand they head for the exits.
p37
aVAnd they're just so uncomfortable.
p38
aVWhen we track them down and ask them what's going on,
p39
aVthey say something like, "I'm just not the creative type."
p40
aVBut we know that's not true.
p41
aVIf they stick with the process, if they stick with it,
p42
aVthey end up doing amazing things.
p43
aVAnd they surprise themselves at just how innovative
p44
aVthey and their teams really are.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo I've been looking at this fear of judgment that we have,
p47
aVthat you don't do things, you're afraid you're going to be judged;
p48
aVif you don't say the right creative thing, you're going to be judged.
p49
aVAnd I had a major breakthrough,
p50
aVwhen I met the psychologist Albert Bandura.
p51
aa(lp52
VI don't know if you know Albert Bandura, but if you go to Wikipedia,
p53
aVit says that he's the fourth most important psychologist in history \u2014
p54
aVyou know, like Freud, Skinner, somebody and Bandura.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VBandura is 86 and he still works at Stanford.
p59
aVAnd he's just a lovely guy.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo I went to see him,
p62
aVbecause he's just worked on phobias for a long time,
p63
aVwhich I'm very interested in.
p64
aVHe had developed this way,
p65
aVthis, kind of, methodology,
p66
aVthat ended up curing people in a very short amount of time,
p67
aVlike, in four hours.
p68
aVHe had a huge cure rate of people who had phobias.
p69
aVAnd we talked about snakes \u2014 I don't know why \u2014
p70
aVwe talked about snakes and fear of snakes as a phobia.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd it was really enjoyable, really interesting.
p73
aVHe told me that he'd invite the test subject in,
p74
aVand he'd say, "You know, there's a snake in the next room
p75
aVand we're going to go in there."
p76
aVTo which, he reported, most of them replied,
p77
aV"Hell no! I'm not going in there, certainly if there's a snake in there."
p78
aa(lp79
VBut Bandura has a step-by-step process that was super successful.
p80
aVSo he'd take people to this two-way mirror
p81
aVlooking into the room where the snake was.
p82
aVAnd he'd get them comfortable with that.
p83
aVThen through a series of steps,
p84
aVhe'd move them and they'd be standing in the doorway with the door open,
p85
aVand they'd be looking in there.
p86
aVAnd he'd get them comfortable with that.
p87
aVAnd then many more steps later, baby steps,
p88
aVthey'd be in the room, they'd have a leather glove like a welder's glove on,
p89
aVand they'd eventually touch the snake.
p90
aVAnd when they touched the snake, everything was fine. They were cured.
p91
aVIn fact, everything was better than fine.
p92
aVThese people who had lifelong fears of snakes
p93
aVwere saying things like,
p94
aV"Look how beautiful that snake is."
p95
aVAnd they were holding it in their laps.
p96
aa(lp97
VBandura calls this process "guided mastery."
p98
aVI love that term: guided mastery.
p99
aVAnd something else happened.
p100
aVThese people who went through the process and touched the snake
p101
aVended up having less anxiety about other things in their lives.
p102
aVThey tried harder, they persevered longer,
p103
aVand they were more resilient in the face of failure.
p104
aVThey just gained a new confidence.
p105
aVAnd Bandura calls that confidence "self-efficacy,"
p106
aVthe sense that you can change the world
p107
aVand that you can attain what you set out to do.
p108
aa(lp109
VWell, meeting Bandura was really cathartic for me,
p110
aVbecause I realized that this famous scientist
p111
aVhad documented and scientifically validated
p112
aVsomething that we've seen happen for the last 30 years:
p113
aVthat we could take people who had the fear that they weren't creative,
p114
aVand we could take them through a series of steps,
p115
aVkind of like a series of small successes,
p116
aVand they turn fear into familiarity.
p117
aVAnd they surprise themselves.
p118
aVThat transformation is amazing.
p119
aa(lp120
VWe see it at the d.school all the time.
p121
aVPeople from all different kinds of disciplines,
p122
aVthey think of themselves as only analytical.
p123
aVAnd they come in and they go through the process, our process,
p124
aVthey build confidence and now they think of themselves differently.
p125
aVAnd they're totally emotionally excited about the fact that they walk around
p126
aVthinking of themselves as a creative person.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo I thought one of the things I'd do today
p129
aVis take you through and show you what this journey looks like.
p130
aVTo me, that journey looks like Doug Dietz.
p131
aVDoug Dietz is a technical person.
p132
aVHe designs large medical imaging equipment.
p133
aVHe's worked for GE, and he's had a fantastic career.
p134
aVBut at one point, he had a moment of crisis.
p135
aa(lp136
VHe was in the hospital looking at one of his MRI machines in use,
p137
aVwhen he saw a young family, and this little girl.
p138
aVAnd that little girl was crying and was terrified.
p139
aVAnd Doug was really disappointed to learn
p140
aVthat nearly 80 percent of the pediatric patients in this hospital
p141
aVhad to be sedated in order to deal with his MRI machine.
p142
aVAnd this was really disappointing to Doug,
p143
aVbecause before this time, he was proud of what he did.
p144
aVHe was saving lives with this machine.
p145
aVBut it really hurt him to see the fear that this machine caused in kids.
p146
aa(lp147
VAbout that time, he was at the d.school at Stanford taking classes.
p148
aVHe was learning about our process, about design thinking, about empathy,
p149
aVabout iterative prototyping.
p150
aVAnd he would take this new knowledge and do something quite extraordinary.
p151
aVHe would redesign the entire experience
p152
aVof being scanned.
p153
aVAnd this is what he came up with.
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VHe turned it into an adventure for the kids.
p158
aVHe painted the walls and he painted the machine,
p159
aVand he got the operators retrained by people who know kids,
p160
aVlike children's museum people.
p161
aVAnd now when the kid comes, it's an experience.
p162
aVAnd they talk to them about the noise and the movement of the ship.
p163
aVAnd when they come, they say,
p164
aV"OK, you're going to go into the pirate ship,
p165
aVbut be very still, because we don't want the pirates to find you."
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd the results were super dramatic:
p168
aVfrom something like 80 percent of the kids needing to be sedated,
p169
aVto something like 10 percent of the kids needing to be sedated.
p170
aVAnd the hospital and GE were happy, too,
p171
aVbecause you didn't have to call the anesthesiologist all the time,
p172
aVand they could put more kids through the machine in a day.
p173
aVSo the quantitative results were great.
p174
aVBut Doug's results that he cared about were much more qualitative.
p175
aVHe was with one of the mothers
p176
aVwaiting for her child to come out of the scan.
p177
aVAnd when the little girl came out of her scan,
p178
aVshe ran up to her mother and said,
p179
aV"Mommy, can we come back tomorrow?"
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd so, I've heard Doug tell the story many times
p184
aVof his personal transformation
p185
aVand the breakthrough design that happened from it,
p186
aVbut I've never really seen him tell the story of the little girl
p187
aVwithout a tear in his eye.
p188
aa(lp189
VDoug's story takes place in a hospital.
p190
aVI know a thing or two about hospitals.
p191
aVA few years ago, I felt a lump on the side of my neck.
p192
aVIt was my turn in the MRI machine.
p193
aVIt was cancer, it was the bad kind.
p194
aVI was told I had a 40 percent chance of survival.
p195
aa(lp196
VSo while you're sitting around with the other patients,
p197
aVin your pajamas,
p198
aVand everybody's pale and thin \u2014
p199
aa(lp200
V(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
Vyou know? \u2014 and you're waiting for your turn to get the gamma rays,
p203
aVyou think of a lot of things.
p204
aVMostly, you think about: Am I going to survive?
p205
aVAnd I thought a lot about:
p206
aVWhat was my daughter's life going to be like without me?
p207
aVBut you think about other things.
p208
aVI thought a lot about: What was I put on Earth to do?
p209
aVWhat was my calling? What should I do?
p210
aVI was lucky because I had lots of options.
p211
aVWe'd been working in health and wellness,
p212
aVand K-12, and the developing world.
p213
aVso there were lots of projects that I could work on.
p214
aVBut then I decided and committed at this point,
p215
aVto the thing I most wanted to do,
p216
aVwhich was to help as many people as possible
p217
aVregain the creative confidence they lost along their way.
p218
aVAnd if I was going to survive, that's what I wanted to do.
p219
aVI survived, just so you know.
p220
aa(lp221
V(Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
V(Applause)
p224
aa(lp225
VI really believe that when people gain this confidence \u2014
p226
aVand we see it all the time at the d.school and at IDEO \u2014
p227
aVthat they actually start working on the things
p228
aVthat are really important in their lives.
p229
aVWe see people quit what they're doing and go in new directions.
p230
aVWe see them come up with more interesting \u2014 and just more \u2014 ideas,
p231
aVso they can choose from better ideas.
p232
aVAnd they just make better decisions.
p233
aa(lp234
VI know at TED, you're supposed to have a change-the-world kind of thing,
p235
aVisn't that \u2014 everybody has a change-the-world thing?
p236
aVIf there is one for me, this is it, to help this happen.
p237
aVSo I hope you'll join me on my quest,
p238
aVyou as, kind of, thought leaders.
p239
aVIt would be really great if you didn't let people divide the world
p240
aVinto the creatives and the non-creatives, like it's some God-given thing,
p241
aVand to have people realize that they're naturally creative,
p242
aVand that those natural people should let their ideas fly;
p243
aVthat they should achieve what Bandura calls self-efficacy,
p244
aVthat you can do what you set out to do,
p245
aVand that you can reach a place of creative confidence
p246
aVand touch the snake.
p247
aa(lp248
VThank you.

design firm IDEO, David Kelley built the  company that created many icons of the digital generation -- the first  mouse, the first Treo, the thumbs up/thumbs down button on your Tivo&#39;s  remote control, to name a few. But what matters even more to him is  unlocking the creative potential of people and organizations so they can  innovate routinely.</p><p>David Kelley&#39;s most enduring contributions to  the field of design are a methodology and culture of innovation. More  recently, he led the creation of the groundbreaking d.school at  Stanford, the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, where students from  the business, engineering, medicine, law, and other diverse disciplines  develop the capacity to solve complex problems collaboratively and  creatively.</p><p>Kelley was working (unhappily) as an electrical  engineer when he heard about Stanford&#39;s cross-disciplinary Joint Program  in Design, which merged engineering and art. What he learned there -- a  human-centered, team-based approach to tackling sticky problems through  design -- propelled his professional life as a &quot;design thinker.&quot;</p><p>In  1978, he co-founded the design firm that ultimately became IDEO, now  emulated worldwide for its innovative, user-centered approach to design.  IDEO works with a range of clients -- from food and beverage  conglomerates to high tech startups, hospitals to universities, and  today even governments -- conceiving breakthrough innovations ranging  from a life-saving portable defibrillator to a new kind of residence for  wounded warriors, and helping organizations build their own innovation  culture.</p><p>Today, David serves as chair of IDEO and is the Donald  W. Whittier Professor at Stanford, where he has taught for more than 25  years. Preparing the design thinkers of tomorrow earned David the Sir  Misha Black Medal for his &ldquo;distinguished contribution to design  education.&rdquo; He has also won the Edison Achievement Award for Innovation,  as well as the Chrysler Design Award and National Design Award in  Product Design from the Smithsonian&rsquo;s Cooper-Hewitt National Design  Museum, and he is a member of the National Academy of Engineers.</p>", "slug": "david_kelley", "whotheyare": "David Kelley\\u2019s company IDEO helped create many icons of the digital generation -- but what matters even more to him is unlocking the creative potential of people and organizations to innovate routinely.", "whatotherssay": "We\'re focused more and more on human-centered design; that involves designing behaviors and personality into products.", "id": 110, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/7948_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "How to build your creative confidence", "take_action": [{"status": "approved", "start_at": null, "link_url": "http://dschool.stanford.edu/dgift/", "eyebrow": null, "end_at": null, "verb": "sign_up", "published": true, "visible_url": "dschool.stanford.edu", "type": "take_action", "blurb": "**Sign up** for the Stanford d.school\'s virtual crash course in design thinking."}, {"status": "approved", "start_at": null, "link_url": "http://www.ideou.com/", "eyebrow": null, "end_at": null, "verb": "sign_up", "published": true, "visible_url": "ideou.com", "type": "take_action", "blurb": "**Sign up** for an IDEO U design thinking course to boost your creative confidence."}], "comments": 12882, "more_resources": [{"status": "approved", "publisher": "Crown Business", "start_at": null, "author": "Tom Kelley and David Kelley", "headline": "Creative Confidence", "link_url": "http://www.amazon.com/Creative-Confidence-Unleashing-Potential-Within/dp/038534936X/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0520271440&linkCode=as2&tag=teco06-20", "published": true, "eyebrow": null, "end_at": null, "image_url": "http://tedcdnpe-a.akamaihd.net/images/ted/c541b6f8d4a92c61aa5e2bc2245f5821ab58582a_400x616.jpg", "year": "2013", "type": "book", "blurb": null}, {"status": "approved", "start_at": null, "headline": "Things David Kelley loves", "link_url": "http://ideas.ted.com/david-kelley-the-designs-i-love-most/", "eyebrow": null, "end_at": null, "image_url": "", "published": true, "visible_url": "", "type": "from_the_blog", "blurb": "Read about the designer\\u2019s favorite objects, including his 1954 Chevy pickup and a table saw."}], "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/25308d79fc7c5a343317a5bdbe0d0f62adc4491c_2880x1620.jpg", "description": "Is your school or workplace divided into \\"creatives\\" versus practical people?

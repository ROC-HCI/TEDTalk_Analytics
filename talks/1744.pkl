VWhat would be a good end of life?
p5
aVAnd I'm talking about the very end.
p6
aVI'm talking about dying.
p7
aa(lp8
VWe all think a lot about how to live well.
p9
aVI'd like to talk about increasing our chances of dying well.
p10
aVI'm not a geriatrician.
p11
aVI design reading programs for preschoolers.
p12
aVWhat I know about this topic
p13
aVcomes from a qualitative study with a sample size of two.
p14
aVIn the last few years, I helped two friends
p15
aVhave the end of life they wanted.
p16
aVJim and Shirley Modini spent their 68 years of marriage
p17
aVliving off the grid on their 1,700-acre ranch
p18
aVin the mountains of Sonoma County.
p19
aVThey kept just enough livestock to make ends meet
p20
aVso that the majority of their ranch would remain a refuge
p21
aVfor the bears and lions and so many other things
p22
aVthat lived there.
p23
aVThis was their dream.
p24
aa(lp25
VI met Jim and Shirley in their 80s.
p26
aVThey were both only children who chose not to have kids.
p27
aVAs we became friends, I became their trustee
p28
aVand their medical advocate,
p29
aVbut more importantly, I became
p30
aVthe person who managed their end-of-life experiences.
p31
aVAnd we learned a few things about how to have a good end.
p32
aa(lp33
VIn their final years, Jim and Shirley
p34
aVfaced cancers, fractures, infections, neurological illness.
p35
aVIt's true.
p36
aVAt the end, our bodily functions
p37
aVand independence are declining to zero.
p38
aVWhat we found is that, with a plan and the right people,
p39
aVquality of life can remain high.
p40
aVThe beginning of the end is triggered
p41
aVby a mortality awareness event, and during this time,
p42
aVJim and Shirley chose ACR nature preserves
p43
aVto take their ranch over when they were gone.
p44
aVThis gave them the peace of mind to move forward.
p45
aVIt might be a diagnosis. It might be your intuition.
p46
aVBut one day, you're going to say, "This thing is going to get me."
p47
aVJim and Shirley spent this time
p48
aVletting friends know that their end was near
p49
aVand that they were okay with that.
p50
aa(lp51
VDying from cancer and dying from neurological illness
p52
aVare different.
p53
aVIn both cases, last days are about quiet reassurance.
p54
aVJim died first. He was conscious until the very end,
p55
aVbut on his last day he couldn't talk.
p56
aVThrough his eyes, we knew when he needed to hear again,
p57
aV"It is all set, Jim. We're going to take care of Shirley
p58
aVright here at the ranch,
p59
aVand ACR's going to take care of your wildlife forever."
p60
aa(lp61
VFrom this experience I'm going to share five practices.
p62
aVI've put worksheets online,
p63
aVso if you'd like, you can plan your own end.
p64
aa(lp65
VIt starts with a plan.
p66
aVMost people say, "I'd like to die at home."
p67
aVEighty percent of Americans die in a hospital
p68
aVor a nursing home.
p69
aVSaying we'd like to die at home is not a plan.
p70
aVA lot of people say, "If I get like that, just shoot me."
p71
aVThis is not a plan either; this is illegal.
p72
aV(Laughter)
p73
aVA plan involves answering
p74
aVstraightforward questions about the end you want.
p75
aVWhere do you want to be when you're no longer independent?
p76
aVWhat do you want in terms of medical intervention?
p77
aVAnd who's going to make sure your plan is followed?
p78
aa(lp79
VYou will need advocates.
p80
aVHaving more than one increases your chance
p81
aVof getting the end you want.
p82
aVDon't assume the natural choice is your spouse or child.
p83
aVYou want someone who has the time and proximity
p84
aVto do this job well, and you want someone
p85
aVwho can work with people under the pressure
p86
aVof an ever-changing situation.
p87
aa(lp88
VHospital readiness is critical.
p89
aVYou are likely to be headed to the emergency room,
p90
aVand you want to get this right.
p91
aVPrepare a one-page summary of your medical history,
p92
aVmedications and physician information.
p93
aVPut this in a really bright envelope
p94
aVwith copies of your insurance cards, your power of attorney,
p95
aVand your do-not-resuscitate order.
p96
aVHave advocates keep a set in their car.
p97
aVTape a set to your refrigerator.
p98
aVWhen you show up in the E.R. with this packet,
p99
aVyour admission is streamlined in a material way.
p100
aa(lp101
VYou're going to need caregivers.
p102
aVYou'll need to assess your personality and financial situation
p103
aVto determine whether an elder care community
p104
aVor staying at home is your best choice.
p105
aVIn either case, do not settle.
p106
aVWe went through a number of not-quite-right caregivers
p107
aVbefore we found the perfect team
p108
aVled by Marsha,
p109
aVwho won't let you win at bingo just because you're dying
p110
aVbut will go out and take videos of your ranch for you
p111
aVwhen you can't get out there,
p112
aVand Caitlin, who won't let you skip your morning exercises
p113
aVbut knows when you need to hear
p114
aVthat your wife is in good hands.
p115
aa(lp116
VFinally, last words.
p117
aVWhat do you want to hear at the very end,
p118
aVand from whom would you like to hear it?
p119
aVIn my experience, you'll want to hear
p120
aVthat whatever you're worried about is going to be fine.
p121
aVWhen you believe it's okay to let go, you will.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo, this is a topic that normally inspires fear and denial.
p124
aVWhat I've learned
p125
aVis if we put some time into planning our end of life,
p126
aVwe have the best chance of maintaining our quality of life.
p127
aVHere are Jim and Shirley just after deciding
p128
aVwho would take care of their ranch.
p129
aVHere's Jim just a few weeks before he died,
p130
aVcelebrating a birthday he didn't expect to see.
p131
aVAnd here's Shirley just a few days before she died
p132
aVbeing read an article in that day's paper
p133
aVabout the significance of the wildlife refuge
p134
aVat the Modini ranch.
p135
aa(lp136
VJim and Shirley had a good end of life,
p137
aVand by sharing their story with you,
p138
aVI hope to increase our chances of doing the same.
p139
aa(lp140
VThank you.

Johnston&#39;s credo, &quot;love words early,&quot; and her focus on the earliest years of life, is an interesting foil for her other passion: Planning for end of life. Johnston&#39;s side project, <a href=\\"http://www.goodendoflife.com/about.htm\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Good [End of] Life</a>, deals not with happy babies decoding symbols, but with a much more morbid topic: Death. Good [End of] Life is a set of online worksheets and practices that aim to help deal with difficult questions -- like who should speak for you if you cannot speak, and whether to fill out a do-not-resuscitate form -- before it&#39;s too late.</p><p>In the past 15 years alone Johnston has founded two other companies in addition to Blue Lake Children&#39;s Publishing: PrintPaks, a children&#39;s software company, and Kibu, a social networking site for teenage girls.

VI'm very pleased to be here today
p5
aVto talk to you all about how we might repair
p6
aVthe damaged brain,
p7
aVand I'm particularly excited by this field,
p8
aVbecause as a neurologist myself,
p9
aVI believe that this offers one of the great ways
p10
aVthat we might be able to offer hope
p11
aVfor patients who today live with devastating
p12
aVand yet untreatable diseases of the brain.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo here's the problem.
p15
aVYou can see here the picture of somebody's brain
p16
aVwith Alzheimer's disease
p17
aVnext to a healthy brain,
p18
aVand what's obvious is, in the Alzheimer's brain,
p19
aVringed red, there's obvious damage \u2014 atrophy, scarring.
p20
aVAnd I could show you equivalent pictures
p21
aVfrom other disease: multiple sclerosis,
p22
aVmotor neuron disease, Parkinson's disease,
p23
aVeven Huntington's disease,
p24
aVand they would all tell a similar story.
p25
aVAnd collectively these brain disorders represent
p26
aVone of the major public health threats of our time.
p27
aVAnd the numbers here are really rather staggering.
p28
aVAt any one time, there are 35 million people today
p29
aVliving with one of these brain diseases,
p30
aVand the annual cost globally
p31
aVis 700 billion dollars.
p32
aVI mean, just think about that.
p33
aVThat's greater than one percent
p34
aVof the global GDP.
p35
aVAnd it gets worse,
p36
aVbecause all these numbers are rising
p37
aVbecause these are by and large
p38
aVage-related diseases, and we're living longer.
p39
aVSo the question we really need to ask ourselves is,
p40
aVwhy, given the devastating impact of these diseases
p41
aVto the individual,
p42
aVnever mind the scale of the societal problem,
p43
aVwhy are there no effective treatments?
p44
aa(lp45
VNow in order to consider this,
p46
aVI first need to give you a crash course
p47
aVin how the brain works.
p48
aVSo in other words, I need to tell you
p49
aVeverything I learned at medical school.
p50
aV(Laughter)
p51
aVBut believe me, this isn't going to take very long.
p52
aVOkay? (Laughter)
p53
aVSo the brain is terribly simple:
p54
aVit's made up of four cells,
p55
aVand two of them are shown here.
p56
aVThere's the nerve cell,
p57
aVand then there's the myelinating cell,
p58
aVor the insulating cell.
p59
aVIt's called oligodendrocyte.
p60
aVAnd when these four cells work together
p61
aVin health and harmony,
p62
aVthey create an extraordinary symphony of electrical activity,
p63
aVand it is this electrical activity
p64
aVthat underpins our ability to think, to emote,
p65
aVto remember, to learn, move, feel and so on.
p66
aVBut equally, each of these individual four cells
p67
aValone or together, can go rogue or die,
p68
aVand when that happens, you get damage.
p69
aVYou get damaged wiring.
p70
aVYou get disrupted connections.
p71
aVAnd that's evident here with the slower conduction.
p72
aVBut ultimately, this damage will manifest
p73
aVas disease, clearly.
p74
aVAnd if the starting dying nerve cell
p75
aVis a motor nerve, for example,
p76
aVyou'll get motor neuron disease.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo I'd like to give you a real-life illustration
p79
aVof what happens with motor neuron disease.
p80
aVSo this is a patient of mine called John.
p81
aVJohn I saw just last week in the clinic.
p82
aVAnd I've asked John to tell us something  about what were his problems
p83
aVthat led to the initial diagnosis
p84
aVof motor neuron disease.
p85
aa(lp86
VJohn: I was diagnosed in October in 2011,
p87
aVand the main problem was a breathing problem,
p88
aVdifficulty breathing.
p89
aa(lp90
VSiddharthan Chandran: I don't know if you caught all of that, but what John was telling us
p91
aVwas that difficulty with breathing
p92
aVled eventually to the diagnosis
p93
aVof motor neuron disease.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo John's now 18 months further down in that journey,
p96
aVand I've now asked him to tell us something about
p97
aVhis current predicament.
p98
aa(lp99
VJohn: What I've got now is  the breathing's gotten worse.
p100
aVI've got weakness in my hands,  my arms and my legs.
p101
aVSo basically I'm in a wheelchair most of the time.
p102
aa(lp103
VSC: John's just told us he's in a wheelchair
p104
aVmost of the time.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo what these two clips show
p107
aVis not just the devastating consequence of the disease,
p108
aVbut they also tell us something about
p109
aVthe shocking pace of the disease,
p110
aVbecause in just 18 months,
p111
aVa fit adult man has been rendered
p112
aVwheelchair- and respirator-dependent.
p113
aVAnd let's face it, John could be anybody's father,
p114
aVbrother or friend.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo that's what happens when the motor nerve dies.
p117
aVBut what happens when that myelin cell dies?
p118
aVYou get multiple sclerosis.
p119
aVSo the scan on your left
p120
aVis an illustration of the brain,
p121
aVand it's a map of the connections of the brain,
p122
aVand superimposed upon which
p123
aVare areas of damage.
p124
aVWe call them lesions of demyelination.
p125
aVBut they're damage, and they're white.
p126
aa(lp127
VSo I know what you're thinking here.
p128
aVYou're thinking, "My God, this bloke came up
p129
aVand said he's going to talk about hope,
p130
aVand all he's done is give a really rather bleak
p131
aVand depressing tale."
p132
aVI've told you these diseases are terrible.
p133
aVThey're devastating, numbers are rising,
p134
aVthe costs are ridiculous, and worst of all,
p135
aVwe have no treatment. Where's the hope?
p136
aa(lp137
VWell, you know what? I think there is hope.
p138
aVAnd there's hope in this next section,
p139
aVof this brain section of somebody else with M.S.,
p140
aVbecause what it illustrates
p141
aVis, amazingly, the brain can repair itself.
p142
aVIt just doesn't do it well enough.
p143
aVAnd so again, there are two things I want to show you.
p144
aVFirst of all is the damage of this patient with M.S.
p145
aVAnd again, it's another one of these white masses.
p146
aVBut crucially, the area that's ringed red
p147
aVhighlights an area that is pale blue.
p148
aVBut that area that is pale blue was once white.
p149
aVSo it was damaged. It's now repaired.
p150
aVJust to be clear: It's not because of doctors.
p151
aVIt's in spite of doctors, not because of doctors.
p152
aVThis is spontaneous repair.
p153
aVIt's amazing and it's occurred
p154
aVbecause there are stem cells in the brain, even,
p155
aVwhich can enable new myelin, new insulation,
p156
aVto be laid down over the damaged nerves.
p157
aVAnd this observation is important for two reasons.
p158
aVThe first is it challenges one of the orthodoxies
p159
aVthat we learnt at medical school,
p160
aVor at least I did, admittedly last century,
p161
aVwhich is that the brain doesn't repair itself,
p162
aVunlike, say, the bone or the liver.
p163
aVBut actually it does, but it just doesn't do it well enough.
p164
aVAnd the second thing it does,
p165
aVand it gives us a very clear direction  of travel for new therapies \u2014
p166
aVI mean, you don't need to be a rocket scientist
p167
aVto know what to do here.
p168
aVYou simply need to find ways of promoting
p169
aVthe endogenous, spontaneous repair that occurs anyway.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo the question is, why, if we've known that
p172
aVfor some time, as we have,
p173
aVwhy do we not have those treatments?
p174
aVAnd that in part reflects the complexity
p175
aVof drug development.
p176
aVNow, drug development you might think of
p177
aVas a rather expensive but risky bet,
p178
aVand the odds of this bet are roughly this:
p179
aVthey're 10,000 to one against,
p180
aVbecause you need to screen about 10,000 compounds
p181
aVto find that one potential winner.
p182
aVAnd then you need to spend 15 years
p183
aVand spend over a billion dollars,
p184
aVand even then, you may not have a winner.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo the question for us is,
p187
aVcan you change the rules of the game
p188
aVand can you shorten the odds?
p189
aVAnd in order to do that, you have to think,
p190
aVwhere is the bottleneck in this drug discovery?
p191
aVAnd one of the bottlenecks is  early in drug discovery.
p192
aVAll that screening occurs in animal models.
p193
aVBut we know that the proper  study of mankind is man,
p194
aVto borrow from Alexander Pope.
p195
aVSo the question is, can we study these diseases
p196
aVusing human material?
p197
aVAnd of course, absolutely we can.
p198
aVWe can use stem cells,
p199
aVand specifically we can use human stem cells.
p200
aVAnd human stem cells are these extraordinary
p201
aVbut simple cells that can do two things:
p202
aVthey can self-renew or make more of themselves,
p203
aVbut they can also become specialized
p204
aVto make bone, liver or, crucially, nerve cells,
p205
aVmaybe even the motor nerve cell
p206
aVor the myelin cell.
p207
aVAnd the challenge has long been,
p208
aVcan we harness the power,
p209
aVthe undoubted power of these stem cells
p210
aVin order to realize their promise
p211
aVfor regenerative neurology?
p212
aa(lp213
VAnd I think we can now, and the reason we can
p214
aVis because there have been several major discoveries
p215
aVin the last 10, 20 years.
p216
aVOne of them was here in Edinburgh,
p217
aVand it must be the only celebrity sheep, Dolly.
p218
aVSo Dolly was made in Edinburgh,
p219
aVand Dolly was an example
p220
aVof the first cloning of a mammal
p221
aVfrom an adult cell.
p222
aVBut I think the even more significant breakthrough
p223
aVfor the purposes of our discussion today
p224
aVwas made in 2006 by a Japanese scientist
p225
aVcalled Yamanaka.
p226
aVAnd what Yamaka did,
p227
aVin a fantastic form of scientific cookery,
p228
aVwas he showed that four ingredients,
p229
aVjust four ingredients,
p230
aVcould effectively convert any cell, adult cell,
p231
aVinto a master stem cell.
p232
aVAnd the significance of this is difficult to exaggerate,
p233
aVbecause what it means that from anybody in this room,
p234
aVbut particularly patients,
p235
aVyou could now generate
p236
aVa bespoke, personalized tissue repair kit.
p237
aVTake a skin cell, make it a master pluripotent cell,
p238
aVso you could then make those cells
p239
aVthat are relevant to their disease,
p240
aVboth to study but potentially to treat.
p241
aVNow, the idea of that at medical school \u2014
p242
aVthis is a recurring theme, isn't  it, me and medical school? \u2014
p243
aVwould have been ridiculous,
p244
aVbut it's an absolute reality today.
p245
aVAnd I see this as the cornerstone
p246
aVof regeneration, repair and hope.
p247
aa(lp248
VAnd whilst we're on the theme of hope,
p249
aVfor those of you who might have failed at school,
p250
aVthere's hope for you as well,
p251
aVbecause this is the school report of John Gerdon.
p252
aV["I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist; on his present showing this is quite ridiculous."]
p253
aVSo they didn't think much of him then.
p254
aVBut what you may not know is that he  got the Nobel Prize for medicine
p255
aVjust three months ago.
p256
aa(lp257
VSo to return to the original problem,
p258
aVwhat is the opportunity of these stem cells,
p259
aVor this disruptive technology,
p260
aVfor repairing the damaged brain,
p261
aVwhich we call regenerative neurology?
p262
aVI think there are two ways you can think about this:
p263
aVas a fantastic 21st-century drug discovery tool,
p264
aVand/or as a form of therapy.
p265
aVSo I want to tell you a little bit about both of those
p266
aVin the next few moments.
p267
aa(lp268
VDrug discovery in a dish is how people often
p269
aVtalk about this.
p270
aVIt's very simple: You take a patient with a disease,
p271
aVlet's say motor neuron disease,
p272
aVyou take a skin sample,
p273
aVyou do the pluripotent reprogramming,
p274
aVas I've already told you,
p275
aVand you generate live motor nerve cells.
p276
aVThat's straightforward, because that's what
p277
aVpluripotent cells can do.
p278
aVBut crucially, you can then compare their behavior
p279
aVto their equivalent but healthy counterparts,
p280
aVideally from an unaffected relative.
p281
aVThat way, you're matching for genetic variation.
p282
aa(lp283
VAnd that's exactly what we did here.
p284
aVThis was a collaboration with colleagues:
p285
aVin London, Chris Shaw; in the U.S.,  Steve Finkbeiner and Tom Maniatis.
p286
aVAnd what you're looking at, and this is amazing,
p287
aVthese are living, growing, motor nerve cells
p288
aVfrom a patient with motor neuron disease.
p289
aVIt happens to be an inherited form.
p290
aVI mean, just imagine that.
p291
aVThis would have been unimaginable 10 years ago.
p292
aVSo apart from seeing them grow and put out processes,
p293
aVwe can also engineer them so that they fluoresce,
p294
aVbut crucially, we can then track their individual health
p295
aVand compare the diseased motor nerve cells
p296
aVto the healthy ones.
p297
aVAnd when you do all that and put it together,
p298
aVyou realize that the diseased ones,
p299
aVwhich is represented in the red line,
p300
aVare two and a half times more likely to die
p301
aVthan the healthy counterpart.
p302
aVAnd the crucial point about this is that you then have
p303
aVa fantastic assay to discover drugs,
p304
aVbecause what would you ask of the drugs,
p305
aVand you could do this through a high-throughput
p306
aVautomated screening system,
p307
aVyou'd ask the drugs, give me one thing:
p308
aVfind me a drug that will bring the red line
p309
aVcloser to the blue line,
p310
aVbecause that drug will be a high-value candidate
p311
aVthat you could probably take direct to human trial
p312
aVand almost bypass that bottleneck
p313
aVthat I've told you about in drug discovery
p314
aVwith the animal models,
p315
aVif that makes sense. It's fantastic.
p316
aa(lp317
VBut I want to come back
p318
aVto how you might use stem cells directly
p319
aVto repair damage.
p320
aVAnd again there are two ways to think about this,
p321
aVand they're not mutually exclusive.
p322
aVThe first, and I think in the long run
p323
aVthe one that will give us the biggest dividend,
p324
aVbut it's not thought of that way just yet,
p325
aVis to think about those stem cells that are already
p326
aVin your brain, and I've told you that.
p327
aVAll of us have stem cells in the brain,
p328
aVeven the diseased brain,
p329
aVand surely the smart way forward
p330
aVis to find ways that you can promote and activate
p331
aVthose stem cells in your brain already
p332
aVto react and respond appropriately to damage
p333
aVto repair it.
p334
aVThat will be the future.
p335
aVThere will be drugs that will do that.
p336
aa(lp337
VBut the other way is to effectively parachute in cells,
p338
aVtransplant them in,
p339
aVto replace dying or lost cells, even in the brain.
p340
aVAnd I want to tell you now an experiment,
p341
aVit's a clinical trial that we did,
p342
aVwhich recently completed,
p343
aVwhich is with colleagues in UCL,
p344
aVDavid Miller in particular.
p345
aVSo this study was very simple.
p346
aVWe took patients with multiple sclerosis
p347
aVand asked a simple question:
p348
aVWould stem cells from the bone marrow
p349
aVbe protective of their nerves?
p350
aVSo what we did was we took this bone marrow,
p351
aVgrew up the stem cells in the lab,
p352
aVand then injected them back into the vein.
p353
aVI'm making this sound really simple.
p354
aVIt took five years off a lot of people, okay?
p355
aVAnd it put gray hair on me
p356
aVand caused all kinds of issues.
p357
aVBut conceptually, it's essentially simple.
p358
aVSo we've given them into the vein, right?
p359
aVSo in order to measure whether this was successful or not,
p360
aVwe measured the optic nerve
p361
aVas our outcome measure.
p362
aVAnd that's a good thing to measure in M.S.,
p363
aVbecause patients with M.S. sadly suffer
p364
aVwith problems with vision \u2014
p365
aVloss of vision, unclear vision.
p366
aVAnd so we measured the size of the optic nerve
p367
aVusing the scans with David Miller
p368
aVthree times \u2014 12 months, six months,
p369
aVand before the infusion \u2014
p370
aVand you can see the gently declining red line.
p371
aVAnd that's telling you that the optic nerve is shrinking,
p372
aVwhich makes sense, because their nerves are dying.
p373
aVWe then gave the stem cell infusion
p374
aVand repeated the measurement twice \u2014
p375
aVthree months and six months \u2014
p376
aVand to our surprise, almost,
p377
aVthe line's gone up.
p378
aVThat suggests that the intervention
p379
aVhas been protective.
p380
aVI don't think myself that what's happened
p381
aVis that those stem cells have made new myelin
p382
aVor new nerves.
p383
aVWhat I think they've done is they've promoted
p384
aVthe endogenous stem cells, or precursor cells,
p385
aVto do their job, wake up, lay down new myelin.
p386
aVSo this is a proof of concept.
p387
aVI'm very excited about that.
p388
aa(lp389
VSo I just want to end with the theme I began on,
p390
aVwhich was regeneration and hope.
p391
aVSo here I've asked John
p392
aVwhat his hopes are for the future.
p393
aa(lp394
VJohn: I would hope that
p395
aVsometime in the future
p396
aVthrough the research that you people are doing,
p397
aVwe can come up with a cure
p398
aVso that people like me can lead a normal life.
p399
aa(lp400
VSC: I mean, that speaks volumes.
p401
aa(lp402
VBut I'd like to close by first of all thanking John \u2014
p403
aVthanking John for allowing me to share
p404
aVhis insights and these clips with you all.
p405
aVBut I'd also like to add to John and to others
p406
aVthat my own view is, I'm hopeful for the future.
p407
aVI do believe that the disruptive technologies
p408
aVlike stem cells that I've tried to explain to you
p409
aVdo offer very real hope.
p410
aVAnd I do think that the day that we might be able
p411
aVto repair the damaged brain
p412
aVis sooner than we think.
p413
aVThank you.

V'Theme and variations' is one of those forms that
p5
aVrequire a certain kind of intellectual activity,
p6
aVbecause you are always comparing the variation
p7
aVwith the theme that you hold in your mind.
p8
aVYou might say that the theme is nature
p9
aVand everything that follows is a variation on the subject.
p10
aa(lp11
VI was asked, I guess about six years ago,
p12
aVto do a series of paintings
p13
aVthat in some way would celebrate the birth of Piero della Francesca.
p14
aVAnd it was very difficult for me to imagine
p15
aVhow to paint pictures that were based on Piero
p16
aVuntil I realized that I could look at Piero as nature \u2014
p17
aVthat I would have the same attitude towards looking at Piero della Francesca
p18
aVas I would if I were looking out a window at a tree.
p19
aVAnd that was enormously liberating to me.
p20
aVPerhaps it's not a very insightful observation,
p21
aVbut that really started me on a path to be able to do a kind of theme and variations
p22
aa(lp23
Vbased on a work by Piero,
p24
aVin this case that remarkable painting that's in the Uffizi, "The Duke of Montefeltro,"
p25
aVwho faces his consort, Battista.
p26
aVOnce I realized that I could take some liberties with the subject,
p27
aVI did the following series of drawings.
p28
aVThat's the real Piero della Francesca \u2014
p29
aVone of the greatest portraits in human history.
p30
aVAnd these, I'll just show these without comment.
p31
aVIt's just a series of variations on the head of the Duke of Montefeltro,
p32
aVwho's a great, great figure in the Renaissance,
p33
aVand probably the basis for Machiavelli's "The Prince."
p34
aVHe apparently lost an eye in battle,
p35
aVwhich is why he is always shown in profile.
p36
aVAnd this is Battista.
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd then I decided I could move them around a little bit \u2014
p39
aVso that for the first time in history, they're facing the same direction.
p40
aVWhoops! Passed each other.
p41
aVAnd then a visitor from another painting by Piero,
p42
aVthis is from "The Resurrection of Christ" \u2014
p43
aVas though the cast had just gotten of the set to have a chat.
p44
aVAnd now, four large panels:
p45
aVthis is upper left;
p46
aVupper right;
p47
aVlower left;
p48
aVlower right.
p49
aVIncidentally, I've never understood the conflict between abstraction and naturalism.
p50
aVSince all paintings are inherently abstract to begin with
p51
aVthere doesn't seem to be an argument there.
p52
aa(lp53
VOn another subject \u2014
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter) \u2014
p56
aa(lp57
VI was driving in the country one day with my wife,
p58
aVand I saw this sign,
p59
aVand I said, "That is a fabulous piece of design."
p60
aVAnd she said, "What are you talking about?"
p61
aVI said, "Well, it's so persuasive,
p62
aVbecause the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage,
p63
aVand since most people are so suspicious of garages,
p64
aVand know that they're going to be ripped off,
p65
aVthey use the word 'reliable.'
p66
aVBut everybody says they're reliable.
p67
aVBut, reliable Dutchman" \u2014
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter) \u2014
p70
aa(lp71
V"Fantastic!"
p72
aVBecause as soon as you hear the word Dutchman \u2014
p73
aVwhich is an archaic word, nobody calls Dutch people "Dutchmen" anymore \u2014
p74
aVbut as soon as you hear Dutchman,
p75
aVyou get this picture of the kid with his finger in the dike,
p76
aVpreventing the thing from falling and flooding Holland, and so on.
p77
aVAnd so the entire issue is detoxified by the use of "Dutchman."
p78
aVNow, if you think I'm exaggerating at all in this,
p79
aVall you have to do is substitute something else, like "Indonesian."
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VOr even "French."
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VNow, "Swiss" works, but you know it's going to cost a lot of money.
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VI'm going to take you quickly through the actual process of doing a poster.
p92
aVI do a lot of work for the School of Visual Arts, where I teach,
p93
aVand the director of this school \u2014 a remarkable man named Silas Rhodes \u2014
p94
aVoften gives you a piece of text and he says, "Do something with this."
p95
aVAnd so he did.
p96
aVAnd this was the text \u2014 "In words as fashion the same rule will hold/
p97
aVAlike fantastic if too new or old/
p98
aVBe not the first by whom the new are tried/
p99
aVNor yet the last to lay the old aside."
p100
aVI could make nothing of that.
p101
aVAnd I really struggled with this one.
p102
aVAnd the first thing I did, which was sort of in the absence of another idea,
p103
aVwas say I'll sort of write it out and make some words big,
p104
aVand I'll have some kind of design on the back somehow,
p105
aVand I was hoping \u2014 as one often does \u2014 to stumble into something.
p106
aVSo I took another crack at it \u2014
p107
aVyou've got to keep it moving \u2014
p108
aVand I Xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper
p109
aVand I pasted them down on an ugly board.
p110
aVI thought that something would come out of it,
p111
aVlike "Words rule fantastic new old first last Pope"
p112
aVbecause it's by Alexander Pope,
p113
aVbut I sort of made a mess out of it,
p114
aVand then I thought I'd repeat it in some way so it was legible.
p115
aVSo, it was going nowhere.
p116
aa(lp117
VSometimes, in the middle of a resistant problem,
p118
aVI write down things that I know about it.
p119
aVBut you can see the beginning of an idea there,
p120
aVbecause you can see the word "new" emerging from the "old."
p121
aVThat's what happens.
p122
aVThere's a relationship between the old and the new;
p123
aVthe new emerges from the context of the old.
p124
aVAnd then I did some variations of it,
p125
aVbut it still wasn't coalescing graphically at all.
p126
aVI had this other version which had something interesting about it
p127
aVin terms of being able to put it together in your mind from clues.
p128
aVThe W was clearly a W, the N was clearly an N,
p129
aVeven though they were very fragmentary
p130
aVand there wasn't a lot of information in it.
p131
aVThen I got the words "new" and "old"
p132
aVand now I had regressed back to a point where there seemed to be no return.
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VI was really desperate at this point.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd so, I do something I'm truthfully ashamed of,
p139
aVwhich is that I took two drawings I had made for another purpose
p140
aVand I put them together.
p141
aVIt says "dreams" at the top.
p142
aVAnd I was going to do a thing, I say, "Well, change the copy.
p143
aVLet it say something about dreams, and come to SVA
p144
aVand you'll sort of fulfill your dreams."
p145
aVBut, to my credit,
p146
aVI was so embarrassed about doing that
p147
aVthat I never submitted this sketch.
p148
aVAnd, finally, I arrived at the following solution.
p149
aVNow, it doesn't look terribly interesting,
p150
aVbut it does have something
p151
aVthat distinguishes it from a lot of other posters.
p152
aVFor one thing, it transgresses the idea of what a poster's supposed to be,
p153
aVwhich is to be understood and seen immediately, and not explained.
p154
aVI remember hearing all of you in the graphic arts \u2014
p155
aV"If you have to explain it, it ain't working."
p156
aVAnd one day I woke up and I said, "Well, suppose that's not true?"
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
VSo here's what it says in my explanation at the bottom left.
p161
aVIt says, "Thoughts: This poem is impossible.
p162
aVSilas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations.
p163
aVThis one generates no imagery at all."
p164
aVI am now exposing myself to my audience, right?
p165
aVWhich is something you never want to do professionally.
p166
aV"Maybe the words can make the image without anything else happening.
p167
aVWhat's the heart of this poem?
p168
aVDon't be trendy if you want to be serious.
p169
aVIs doing the poster this way trendy in itself?
p170
aa(lp171
VI guess one could reduce the idea further
p172
aVby suggesting that the new emerges behind and through the old,
p173
aVlike this."
p174
aVAnd then I show you a little drawing \u2014
p175
aVyou see, you remember that old thing I discarded?
p176
aVWell, I found a way to use it.
p177
aVSo, there's that little alternative over there,
p178
aVand I say, "Not bad," \u2014 criticizing myself \u2014
p179
aV"but more didactic than visual.
p180
aVMaybe what wants to be said is that old and the new are locked in a dialectical embrace,
p181
aVa kind of dance where each defines the other."
p182
aVAnd then more self-questioning \u2014 "Am I being simple-minded?
p183
aVIs this the kind of simple that looks obvious, or the kind that looks profound?
p184
aVThere's a significant difference.
p185
aVThis could be embarrassing.
p186
aVActually, I realize fear of embarrassment drives me as much as any ambition.
p187
aVDo you think this sort of thing could really attract a student to the school?"
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VWell, I think there are two fresh things here \u2014 two fresh things.
p192
aVOne is the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience,
p193
aVand not to suggest that I am confident about what I'm doing.
p194
aVAnd as you know, you have to have a front.
p195
aVI mean \u2014 you've got to be confident;
p196
aVif you don't believe in your work, who else is going to believe in it?
p197
aVSo that's one thing,
p198
aVto introduce the idea of doubt into graphics.
p199
aVThat can be a big contribution.
p200
aVThe other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the price of one;
p201
aVyou get the big one
p202
aVand if you don't like that, how about the little one?
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VAnd that too is a relatively new idea.
p207
aVAnd here's just a series of experiments
p208
aVwhere I ask the question of \u2014 does a poster have to be square?
p209
aVNow, this is a little illusion.
p210
aVThat poster is not folded.
p211
aVIt's not folded, that's a photograph
p212
aVand it's cut on the diagonal.
p213
aVSame cheap trick in the upper left-hand corner.
p214
aVAnd here,
p215
aVa very peculiar poster because,
p216
aVsimply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer,
p217
aVit won't sit still in the space.
p218
aVAt times, it seems to be wider at the back than the front,
p219
aVand then it shifts.
p220
aVAnd if you sit here long enough, it'll float off the page into the audience.
p221
aVBut, we don't have time.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VAnd then an experiment \u2014
p226
aVa little bit about the nature of perspective,
p227
aVwhere the outside shape is determined by the peculiarity of perspective,
p228
aVbut the shape of the bottle \u2014 which is identical to the outside shape \u2014
p229
aVis seen frontally.
p230
aVAnd another piece for the art directors' club
p231
aVis "Anna Rees" casting long shadows.
p232
aVThis is another poster from the School of Visual Arts.
p233
aVThere were 10 artists invited to participate in it,
p234
aVand it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive
p235
aVand I didn't want to be embarrassed,
p236
aVso I worked very hard on this.
p237
aVThe idea was \u2014 and it was a brilliant idea \u2014
p238
aVwas to have 10 posters distributed throughout the city's subway system
p239
aVso every time you got on the subway you'd be passing a different poster,
p240
aVall of which had a different idea of what art is.
p241
aa(lp242
VBut I was absolutely stuck on the idea of "art is"
p243
aVand trying to determine what art was.
p244
aVBut then I gave up and I said, "Well, art is whatever."
p245
aVAnd as soon as I said that,
p246
aVI discovered that the word "hat" was hidden in the word "whatever,"
p247
aVand that led me to the inevitable conclusion.
p248
aVBut then again, it's on my list of didactic posters.
p249
aVMy intent is to have a literary accompaniment that explains the poster,
p250
aVin case you don't get it.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
VNow this says, "Note to the viewer:
p255
aVI thought I might use a visual cliche of our time \u2014 Magritte's everyman \u2014
p256
aVto express the idea that art is mystery, continuity and history.
p257
aVI'm also convinced that, in an age of computer manipulation,
p258
aVsurrealism has become banal,
p259
aVa shadow of its former self.
p260
aVThe phrase 'Art is whatever'
p261
aVexpresses the current inclusiveness that surrounds art-making \u2014
p262
aVa sort of 'it ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it' notion.
p263
aa(lp264
VThe shadow of Magritte falls across the central part of the poster
p265
aVa poetic event that occurs as the shadow man isolates the word 'hat,'
p266
aVhidden in the word 'whatever.'
p267
aVThe four hats shown in the poster suggests how art might be defined:
p268
aVas a thing itself, the worth of the thing, the shadow of the thing,
p269
aVand the shape of the thing.
p270
aVWhatever."
p271
aa(lp272
V(Applause)
p273
aa(lp274
VOK.
p275
aa(lp276
V(Applause)
p277
aa(lp278
VAnd the one that I did not submit,
p279
aVwhich I still like,
p280
aVI wanted to use the same phrase.
p281
aVThere were wonderful experiments by Bruno Munari
p282
aVon letterforms some years ago \u2014
p283
aVsort of, see how far you could go and still be able to read them.
p284
aVAnd that idea stuck in my head.
p285
aVBut then I took the pieces that I had taken off and put them at the bottom.
p286
aVAnd, of course those are the remains, and they're so labeled.
p287
aVBut what really happens is that you read it as:
p288
aV"Art is whatever remains."
p289
aa(lp290
VThank you.
p291
aa(lp292
V(Applause)

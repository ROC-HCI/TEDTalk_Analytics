VAs you pointed out, every time you come here, you learn something.
p5
aVThis morning, the world's experts
p6
aVfrom I guess three or four different companies on building seats,
p7
aVI think concluded that ultimately, the solution is, people shouldn't sit down.
p8
aVI could have told them that.
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aVYesterday, the automotive guys gave us some new insights.
p11
aVThey pointed out that, I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today,
p12
aVthey will be steering cars by wire,
p13
aVwithout all that mechanical stuff.
p14
aV(Laughter)
p15
aVThat's reassuring.
p16
aV(Applause)
p17
aVThey then pointed out that there'd be, sort of, the other controls by wire,
p18
aVto get rid of all that mechanical stuff.
p19
aVThat's pretty good, but why not get rid of the wires?
p20
aVThen you don't need anything to control the car, except thinking about it.
p21
aVI would love to talk about the technology,
p22
aVand sometime, in what's past the 15 minutes,
p23
aVI'll be happy to talk to all the techno-geeks around here
p24
aVabout what's in here.
p25
aVBut if I had one thing to say about this, before we get to first,
p26
aVit would be that from the time we started building this,
p27
aVthe big idea wasn't the technology.
p28
aVIt really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it
p29
aVin the iBOT for the disabled community.
p30
aVThe big idea here is, I think, a new piece of a solution
p31
aVto a fairly big problem in transportation.
p32
aVAnd maybe to put that in perspective: there's so much data on this,
p33
aVI'll be happy to give it to you in different forms.
p34
aVYou never know what strikes the fancy of whom,
p35
aVbut everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world.
p36
aVAnd Henry Ford, just about 100 years ago, started cranking out Model Ts.
p37
aVWhat I don't think most people think about
p38
aVis the context of how technology is applied.
p39
aVFor instance, in that time, 91 percent of America
p40
aVlived either on farms or in small towns.
p41
aVSo, the car \u2014
p42
aVthe horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage \u2014 was a big deal;
p43
aVit went twice as fast as a horse and carriage.
p44
aVIt was half as long.
p45
aVAnd it was an environmental improvement, because, for instance,
p46
aVin 1903 they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown Manhattan,
p47
aVbecause you can imagine what the roads look like
p48
aVwhen you have a million horses,
p49
aVand a million of them urinating and doing other things,
p50
aVand the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable.
p51
aVSo the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy.
p52
aVIt also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm,
p53
aVor their farm to a town, or from a town to a city.
p54
aVIt all made sense, with 91 percent of the people living there.
p55
aVBy the 1950s, we started connecting all the towns together
p56
aVwith what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world, the highway system.
p57
aVAnd it is certainly a wonder.
p58
aVAnd by the way, as I take shots at old technologies,
p59
aVI want to assure everybody, and particularly the automotive industry \u2014
p60
aVwho's been very supportive of us \u2014
p61
aVthat I don't think this in any way competes with airplanes, or cars.
p62
aVBut think about where the world is today.
p63
aV50 percent of the global population now lives in cities.
p64
aVThat's 3.2 billion people.
p65
aVWe've solved all the transportation problems
p66
aVthat have changed the world to get it to where we are today.
p67
aV500 years ago, sailing ships started getting reliable enough;
p68
aVwe found a new continent.
p69
aV150 years ago, locomotives got efficient enough, steam power,
p70
aVthat we turned the continent into a country.
p71
aVOver the last hundred years, we started building cars,
p72
aVand then over the 50 years we've connected every city to every other city
p73
aVin an extraordinarily efficient way,
p74
aVand we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that.
p75
aVBut during that entire process, more and more people have been born,
p76
aVand more and more people are moving to cities.
p77
aVChina alone is going to move four to six hundred million people
p78
aVinto cities in the next decade and a half.
p79
aVAnd so, nobody, I think, would argue that airplanes, in the last 50 years,
p80
aVhave turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood.
p81
aVAnd if you just look at how technology has been applied,
p82
aVwe've solved all the long-range, high-speed, high-volume,
p83
aVlarge-weight problems of moving things around.
p84
aVNobody would want to give them up.
p85
aVAnd I certainly wouldn't want to give up my airplane,
p86
aVor my helicopter, or my Humvee, or my Porsche.
p87
aVI love them all. I don't keep any of them in my living room.
p88
aVThe fact is, the last mile is the problem,
p89
aVand half the world now lives in dense cities.
p90
aVAnd people spend, depending on who they are,
p91
aVbetween 90 and 95 percent of their energy getting around on foot.
p92
aVI think there's \u2014 I don't know what data would impress you,
p93
aVbut how about, 43 percent of the refined fuel produced in the world
p94
aVis consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the United States.
p95
aVThree million people die every year in cities due to bad air,
p96
aVand almost all particulate pollution on this planet
p97
aVis produced by transportation devices, particularly sitting in cities.
p98
aVAnd again, I say that not to attack any industry,
p99
aVI think \u2014 I really do \u2014 I love my airplane,
p100
aVand cars on highways moving 60 miles an hour
p101
aVare extraordinarily efficient,
p102
aVboth from an engineering point of view,
p103
aVan energy consumption point of view, and a utility point of view.
p104
aVAnd we all love our cars, and I do.
p105
aVThe problem is, you get into the city and you want to go four blocks,
p106
aVit's neither fun nor efficient nor productive.
p107
aVIt's not sustainable.
p108
aVIf \u2014 in China, in the year 1998, 417 million people used bicycles;
p109
aV1.7 million people used cars.
p110
aVIf five percent of that population became, quote, middle class,
p111
aVand wanted to go the way we've gone in the last hundred years
p112
aVat the same time that 50 percent of their population are moving into cities
p113
aVof the size and density of Manhattan, every six weeks \u2014
p114
aVit isn't sustainable environmentally;
p115
aVit isn't sustainable economically \u2014 there just ain't enough oil \u2014
p116
aVand it's not sustainable politically.
p117
aVI mean, what are we fighting over right now?
p118
aVWe can make it complicated, but what's the world fighting over right now?
p119
aVSo it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile,
p120
aVand it was dumb luck. We were working on iBOTs,
p121
aVbut once we made this, we instantly decided
p122
aVit could be a great alternative to jet skis. You don't need the water.
p123
aVOr snowmobiles. You don't need the snow.
p124
aVOr skiing. It's just fun, and people love to move around doing fun things.
p125
aVAnd every one of those industries, by the way \u2014
p126
aVjust golf carts alone is a multi-billion-dollar industry.
p127
aVBut rather than go license this off, which is what we normally do,
p128
aVit seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology,
p129
aVbut into an understanding of a world that's solved all its other problems,
p130
aVbut has somehow come to accept that cities \u2014 which,
p131
aVright back from ancient Greece on, were meant to walk around,
p132
aVcities that were architected and built for people \u2014
p133
aVnow have a footprint that,
p134
aVwhile we've solved every other transportation problem \u2014
p135
aVand it's like Moore's law.
p136
aVI mean, look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon,
p137
aVthen on a railroad, then an airplane.
p138
aVEvery other form of transportation's been improved.
p139
aVIn 5,000 years, we've gone backwards in getting around cities.
p140
aVThey've gotten bigger; they're spread out.
p141
aVThe most expensive real estate on this planet in every city \u2014
p142
aVWilshire Boulevard, or Fifth Avenue, or Tokyo, or Paris \u2014
p143
aVthe most expensive real estate is their downtowns.
p144
aV65 percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars.
p145
aVThe 20 largest cities in the world.
p146
aVSo you wonder, what if cities could give to their pedestrians
p147
aVwhat we take for granted as we now go between cities?
p148
aVWhat if you could make them fun, attractive, clean,
p149
aVenvironmentally friendly?
p150
aVWhat if it would make it a little bit more palatable
p151
aVto have access via this, as that last link to mass transit,
p152
aVto get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs
p153
aVand use our cars the way we want,
p154
aVand then have our cities energized again?
p155
aVWe thought it would be really neat to do that,
p156
aVand one of the problems we really were worried about
p157
aVis: how do we get legal on the sidewalk?
p158
aVBecause technically I've got motors; I've got wheels \u2014 I'm a motor vehicle.
p159
aVI don't look like a motor vehicle.
p160
aVI have the same footprint as a pedestrian;
p161
aVI have the same unique capability
p162
aVto deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space.
p163
aVI took this down to Ground Zero,
p164
aVand knocked my way through crowds for an hour.
p165
aVI'm a pedestrian. But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two,
p166
aVand if we get told we don't belong on the sidewalk, we have two choices.
p167
aVWe're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter,
p168
aVand I don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff.
p169
aVOr maybe we should be out in the street
p170
aVin front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle.
p171
aVWe've been so concerned about that,
p172
aVwe went to the Postmaster General of the United States,
p173
aVas the first person we ever showed on the outside,
p174
aVand said, "Put your people on it. Everybody trusts their postman.
p175
aVAnd they belong on the sidewalks, and they'll use it seriously."
p176
aVHe agreed. We went to a number of police departments
p177
aVthat want their police officers back in the neighborhood
p178
aVon the beat, carrying 70 pounds of stuff. They love it.
p179
aVAnd I can't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket.
p180
aV(Laughter)
p181
aVSo we've been working really, really hard,
p182
aVbut we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop
p183
aVas an attitude about what's important, and how to apply the technology.
p184
aVWe went out and we found some visionary people
p185
aVwith enough money to let us design and build these things,
p186
aVand in hopefully enough time to get them accepted.
p187
aVSo, I'm happy, really, I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want.
p188
aVAnd yes, it's really fun, and yes, you should all go out and try it.
p189
aVBut if I could ask you to do one thing,
p190
aVit's not to think about it as a piece of technology,
p191
aVbut just imagine that, although we all understand somehow
p192
aVthat it's reasonable that we use our 4,000-pound machine,
p193
aVwhich can go 60 miles an hour,
p194
aVthat can bring you everywhere you want to go,
p195
aVand somehow it's also what we used for the last mile,
p196
aVand it's broken, and it doesn't work.
p197
aVOne of the more exciting things that occurred to us
p198
aVabout why it might get accepted, happened out here in California.
p199
aVA few weeks ago, after we launched it,
p200
aVwe were here with a news crew on Venice Beach, zipping up and back,
p201
aVand he's marveling at the technology,
p202
aVand meanwhile bicycles are zipping by,
p203
aVand skateboarders are zipping by,
p204
aVand a little old lady \u2014 I mean, if you looked in the dictionary,
p205
aVa little old lady \u2014 came by me \u2014
p206
aVand now that I'm on this, I'm the height of a normal adult now \u2014
p207
aVand she just stops, and the camera is there, and she looks up at me
p208
aVand says, "Can I try that?"
p209
aVAnd what was I \u2014 you know, how are you going to say anything?
p210
aVAnd so I said, "Sure."
p211
aVSo I get off, and she gets on, and with a little bit of the usual, ah,
p212
aVthen she turns around, and she goes about 20 feet,
p213
aVand she turns back around, and she's all smiles.
p214
aVAnd she comes back to me and she stops, and she says,
p215
aV"Finally, they made something for us."
p216
aVAnd the camera is looking down at her.
p217
aVI'm thinking, "Wow, that was great \u2014
p218
aV(Laughter)
p219
aV\u2014 please lady, don't say another word."
p220
aV(Laughter)
p221
aVAnd the camera is down at her,
p222
aVand this guy has to put the microphone in her face,
p223
aVsaid, "What do you mean by that?"
p224
aVAnd I figured, "It's all over now,"
p225
aVand she looks up and she says, "Well,"
p226
aVshe's still watching these guys go; she says, "I can't ride a bike," no,
p227
aVshe says, "I can't use a skateboard, and I've never used roller blades,"
p228
aVshe knew them by name;
p229
aVshe says, "And it's been 50 years since I rode a bicycle."
p230
aVThen she looks up, she's looking up, and she says,
p231
aV"And I'm 81 years old, and I don't drive a car anymore.
p232
aVI still have to get to the store, and I can't carry a lot of things."
p233
aVAnd it suddenly occurred to me, that among my many fears,
p234
aVwere not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators
p235
aVand the legislators might not get it \u2014
p236
aVit was that, fundamentally, you believe there's pressure among the people
p237
aVnot to invade the most precious little bit of space left,
p238
aVthe sidewalks in these cities.
p239
aVWhen you look at the 36 inches of legal requirement for sidewalk,
p240
aVthen the eight foot for the parked car, then the three lanes,
p241
aVand then the other eight feet \u2014 it's \u2014
p242
aVthat little piece is all that's there.
p243
aVBut she looks up and says this,
p244
aVand it occurs to me, well, kids aren't going to mind these things,
p245
aVand they don't vote, and business people and then young adults
p246
aVaren't going to mind these things \u2014 they're pretty cool \u2014
p247
aVso I guess subliminally I was worried
p248
aVthat it's the older population that's going to worry.
p249
aVSo, having seen this, and having worried about it for eight years,
p250
aVthe first thing I do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys,
p251
aVcall AARP, get an appointment right away.
p252
aVWe've got to show them this thing.
p253
aVAnd they took it to Washington; they showed them;
p254
aVand they're going to be involved now,
p255
aVwatching how these things get absorbed in a number of cities,
p256
aVlike Atlanta, where we're doing trials to see if it really can, in fact,
p257
aVhelp re-energize their downtown.
p258
aV(Applause)
p259
aVThe bottom line is, whether you believe the United Nations,
p260
aVor any of the other think tanks \u2014
p261
aVin the next 20 years, all human population growth on this planet
p262
aVwill be in cities.
p263
aVIn Asia alone, it will be over a billion people.
p264
aVThey learned to start with cell phones.
p265
aVThey didn't have to take the 100-year trip we took.
p266
aVThey start at the top of the technology food chain.
p267
aVWe've got to start building cities and human environments
p268
aVwhere a 150-pound person can go a couple of miles
p269
aVin a dense, rich, green-space environment,
p270
aVwithout being in a 4,000-pound machine to do it.
p271
aVCars were not meant for parallel parking;
p272
aVthey're wonderful machines to go between cities, but just think about it:
p273
aVwe've solved all the long-range, high-speed problems.
p274
aVThe Greeks went from the theater of Dionysus to the Parthenon in their sandals.
p275
aVYou do it in your sneakers.
p276
aVNot much has changed.
p277
aVIf this thing goes only three times as fast as walking \u2014 three times \u2014
p278
aVa 30-minute walk becomes 10 minutes.
p279
aVYour choice, when living in a city, if it's now 10 minutes \u2014
p280
aVbecause at 30 minutes you want an alternative, whether it's a bus, a train \u2014
p281
aVwe've got to build an infrastructure \u2014 a light rail \u2014
p282
aVor you're going to keep parking those cars.
p283
aVBut if you could put a pin in most cities,
p284
aVand imagine how far you could, if you had the time, walk in one half-hour, it's the city.
p285
aVIf you could make it fun, and make it eight or 10 minutes,
p286
aVyou can't find your car, un-park your car, move your car,
p287
aVre-park your car and go somewhere;
p288
aVyou can't get to a cab or a subway.
p289
aVWe could change the way people allocate their resources,
p290
aVthe way this planet uses its energy,
p291
aVmake it more fun.
p292
aVAnd we're hoping to some extent history will say we were right.
p293
aVThat's Segway. This is a Stirling cycle engine;
p294
aVthis had been confused by a lot of things we're doing.
p295
aVThis little beast, right now, is producing a few hundred watts of electricity.
p296
aVYes, it could be attached to this,
p297
aVand yes, on a kilogram of propane,
p298
aVyou could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose.
p299
aVPerhaps more interesting about this little engine is it'll burn any fuel,
p300
aVbecause some of you might be skeptical
p301
aVabout the capability of this to have an impact,
p302
aVwhere most of the world you can't simply plug into your 120-volt outlet.
p303
aVWe've been working on this,
p304
aVactually, as an alternative energy source,
p305
aVstarting way back with Johnson & Johnson, to run an iBOT,
p306
aVbecause the best batteries you could get \u2014
p307
aV10 watt-hours per kilogram in lead,
p308
aV20 watt-hours per kilogram nickel-cadmium,
p309
aV40 watt-hours per kilogram in nickel-metal hydride,
p310
aV60 watt-hours per kilogram in lithium,
p311
aV8,750 watt-hours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline \u2014
p312
aVwhich is why nobody drives electric cars.
p313
aVBut, in any event, if you can burn it with the same efficiency \u2014
p314
aVbecause it's external combustion \u2014 as your kitchen stove,
p315
aVif you can burn any fuel, it turns out to be pretty neat.
p316
aVIt makes just enough electricity to, for instance, do this,
p317
aVwhich at night is enough electricity, in the rest of the world,
p318
aVas Mr. Holly \u2014 Dr. Holly \u2014 pointed out,
p319
aVcan run computers and a light bulb.
p320
aVBut more interestingly, the thermodynamics of this say,
p321
aVyou're never going to get more than 20 percent efficiency.
p322
aVIt doesn't matter much \u2014 it says if you get 200 watts of electricity,
p323
aVyou'll get 700 or 800 watts of heat.
p324
aVIf you wanted to boil water and re-condense it at a rate of 10 gallons an hour,
p325
aVit takes about 25, a little over 25.3 kilowatt \u2014
p326
aV25,000 watts of continuous power \u2014 to do it.
p327
aVThat's so much energy, you couldn't afford to desalinate
p328
aVor clean water in this country that way.
p329
aVCertainly, in the rest of the world, your choice is to devastate the place,
p330
aVturning everything that will burn into heat, or drink the water that's available.
p331
aVThe number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water.
p332
aVDepending on whose numbers you believe,
p333
aVit's between 60 and 85,000 people per day.
p334
aVWe don't need sophisticated heart transplants around the world.
p335
aVWe need water.
p336
aVAnd women shouldn't have to spend four hours a day looking for it,
p337
aVor watching their kids die.
p338
aVWe figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing,
p339
aVwith a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat,
p340
aVthen using a little bit of the electricity control that process,
p341
aVand for 450 watts, which is a little more than half of its waste heat,
p342
aVit will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water
p343
aVfrom anything that comes into it to cool it.
p344
aVSo if we put this box on here in a few years,
p345
aVcould we have a solution to transportation, electricity,
p346
aVand communication, and maybe drinkable water
p347
aVin a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds?
p348
aVI don't know, but we'll try it.
p349
aVI better shut up.

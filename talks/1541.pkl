VI'm 150 feet down an illegal mine shaft in Ghana.
p5
aVThe air is thick with heat and dust,
p6
aVand it's hard to breathe.
p7
aVI can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me
p8
aVin the darkness, but I can't see much else.
p9
aVI hear voices talking, but mostly the shaft
p10
aVis this cacophony of men coughing,
p11
aVand stone being broken with primitive tools.
p12
aVLike the others, I wear a flickering, cheap flashlight
p13
aVtied to my head with this elastic, tattered band,
p14
aVand I can barely make out the slick tree limbs
p15
aVholding up the walls of the three-foot square hole
p16
aVdropping hundreds of feet into the earth.
p17
aVWhen my hand slips, I suddenly remember a miner
p18
aVI had met days before who had lost his grip
p19
aVand fell countless feet down that shaft.
p20
aa(lp21
VAs I stand talking to you today,
p22
aVthese men are still deep in that hole,
p23
aVrisking their lives without payment or compensation,
p24
aVand often dying.
p25
aa(lp26
VI got to climb out of that hole, and I got to go home,
p27
aVbut they likely never will, because they're trapped in slavery.
p28
aa(lp29
VFor the last 28 years, I've been documenting
p30
aVindigenous cultures in more than 70 countries
p31
aVon six continents, and in 2009 I had the great honor
p32
aVof being the sole exhibitor at the Vancouver Peace Summit.
p33
aVAmongst all the astonishing people I met there,
p34
aVI met a supporter of Free the Slaves, an NGO
p35
aVdedicated to eradicating modern day slavery.
p36
aVWe started talking about slavery, and really,
p37
aVI started learning about slavery,
p38
aVfor I had certainly known it existed in the world,
p39
aVbut not to such a degree.
p40
aVAfter we finished talking, I felt so horrible
p41
aVand honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge
p42
aVof this atrocity in my own lifetime, and I thought,
p43
aVif I don't know, how many other people don't know?
p44
aVIt started burning a hole in my stomach, so within weeks,
p45
aVI flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the director
p46
aVof Free the Slaves and offer them my help.
p47
aa(lp48
VThus began my journey into modern day slavery.
p49
aVOddly, I had been to many of these places before.
p50
aVSome I even considered like my second home.
p51
aVBut this time, I would see the skeletons hidden in the closet.
p52
aa(lp53
VA conservative estimate tells us there are more than
p54
aV27 million people enslaved in the world today.
p55
aVThat's double the amount of people taken from Africa
p56
aVduring the entire trans-Atlantic slave trade.
p57
aVA hundred and fifty years ago, an agricultural slave
p58
aVcost about three times the annual salary
p59
aVof an American worker.
p60
aVThat equates to about $50,000 in today's money.
p61
aVYet today, entire families can be enslaved for generations
p62
aVover a debt as small as $18.
p63
aVAstonishingly, slavery generates profits
p64
aVof more than $13 billion worldwide each year.
p65
aa(lp66
VMany have been tricked by false promises
p67
aVof a good education, a better job, only to find
p68
aVthat they're forced to work without pay
p69
aVunder the threat of violence, and they cannot walk away.
p70
aa(lp71
VToday's slavery is about commerce,
p72
aVso the goods that enslaved people produce have value,
p73
aVbut the people producing them are disposable.
p74
aVSlavery exists everywhere, nearly, in the world,
p75
aVand yet it is illegal everywhere in the world.
p76
aa(lp77
VIn India and Nepal, I was introduced to the brick kilns.
p78
aVThis strange and awesome sight was like
p79
aVwalking into ancient Egypt or Dante's Inferno.
p80
aVEnveloped in temperatures of 130 degrees,
p81
aVmen, women, children, entire families in fact,
p82
aVwere cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust,
p83
aVwhile mechanically stacking bricks on their head,
p84
aVup to 18 at a time, and carrying them
p85
aVfrom the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away.
p86
aVDeadened by monotony and exhaustion,
p87
aVthey work silently, doing this task over and over
p88
aVfor 16 or 17 hours a day.
p89
aVThere were no breaks for food, no water breaks,
p90
aVand the severe dehydration made urinating
p91
aVpretty much inconsequential.
p92
aVSo pervasive was the heat and the dust
p93
aVthat my camera became too hot to even touch
p94
aVand ceased working.
p95
aVEvery 20 minutes, I'd have to run back to our cruiser
p96
aVto clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner
p97
aVto revive it, and as I sat there,
p98
aVI thought, my camera is getting far better treatment
p99
aVthan these people.
p100
aa(lp101
VBack in the kilns, I wanted to cry,
p102
aVbut the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me
p103
aVand he said, "Lisa, don't do that. Just don't do that here."
p104
aVAnd he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays
p105
aVare very dangerous in a place like this,
p106
aVnot just for me, but for them.
p107
aVI couldn't offer them any direct help.
p108
aVI couldn't give them money, nothing.
p109
aVI wasn't a citizen of that country.
p110
aVI could get them in a worse situation
p111
aVthan they were already in.
p112
aVI'd have to rely on Free the Slaves to work
p113
aVwithin the system for their liberation,
p114
aVand I trusted that they would.
p115
aVAs for me, I'd have to wait until I got home
p116
aVto really feel my heartbreak.
p117
aa(lp118
VIn the Himalayas, I found children carrying stone
p119
aVfor miles down mountainous terrain
p120
aVto trucks waiting at roads below.
p121
aVThe big sheets of slate were heavier
p122
aVthan the children carrying them,
p123
aVand the kids hoisted them from their heads
p124
aVusing these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope
p125
aVand torn cloth.
p126
aVIt's difficult to witness something so overwhelming.
p127
aVHow can we affect something so insidious,
p128
aVyet so pervasive?
p129
aVSome don't even know they're enslaved,
p130
aVpeople working 16, 17 hours a day without any pay,
p131
aVbecause this has been the case all their lives.
p132
aVThey have nothing to compare it to.
p133
aVWhen these villagers claimed their freedom,
p134
aVthe slaveholders burned down all of their houses.
p135
aVI mean, these people had nothing,
p136
aVand they were so petrified, they wanted to give up,
p137
aVbut the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere,
p138
aVand abolitionists on the ground
p139
aVhelped them get a quarry lease of their own,
p140
aVso that now they do the same back-breaking work,
p141
aVbut they do it for themselves, and they get paid for it,
p142
aVand they do it in freedom.
p143
aa(lp144
VSex trafficking is what we often think of
p145
aVwhen we hear the word slavery,
p146
aVand because of this worldwide awareness,
p147
aVI was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely
p148
aVwithin this particular industry.
p149
aa(lp150
VIn Kathmandu, I was escorted by women who had
p151
aVpreviously been sex slaves themselves.
p152
aVThey ushered me down a narrow set of stairs
p153
aVthat led to this dirty, dimly fluorescent lit basement.
p154
aVThis wasn't a brothel, per se.
p155
aVIt was more like a restaurant.
p156
aVCabin restaurants, as they're known in the trade,
p157
aVare venues for forced prostitution.
p158
aVEach has small, private rooms, where the slaves,
p159
aVwomen, along with young girls and boys,
p160
aVsome as young as seven years old,
p161
aVare forced to entertain the clients,
p162
aVencouraging them to buy more food and alcohol.
p163
aVEach cubicle is dark and dingy,
p164
aVidentified with a painted number on the wall,
p165
aVand partitioned by plywood and a curtain.
p166
aVThe workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse
p167
aVat the hands of their customers.
p168
aVStanding in the near darkness, I remember feeling
p169
aVthis quick, hot fear, and in that instant,
p170
aVI could only imagine what it must be like
p171
aVto be trapped in that hell.
p172
aVI had only one way out: the stairs from where I'd come in.
p173
aVThere were no back doors.
p174
aVThere were no windows large enough to climb through.
p175
aVThese people have no escape at all,
p176
aVand as we take in such a difficult subject,
p177
aVit's important to note that slavery, including sex trafficking,
p178
aVoccurs in our own backyard as well.
p179
aa(lp180
VTens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture,
p181
aVin restaurants, in domestic servitude,
p182
aVand the list can go on.
p183
aVRecently, the New York Times reported that
p184
aVbetween 100,000 and 300,000 American children
p185
aVare sold into sex slavery every year.
p186
aVIt's all around us. We just don't see it.
p187
aa(lp188
VThe textile industry is another one we often think of
p189
aVwhen we hear about slave labor.
p190
aVI visited villages in India where entire families were enslaved
p191
aVin the silk trade.
p192
aVThis is a family portrait.
p193
aVThe dyed black hands are the father, while the blue
p194
aVand red hands are his sons.
p195
aVThey mix dye in these big barrels,
p196
aVand they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows,
p197
aVbut the dye is toxic.
p198
aa(lp199
VMy interpreter told me their stories.
p200
aa(lp201
V"We have no freedom," they said.
p202
aV"We hope still, though, that we could leave this house
p203
aVsomeday and go someplace else
p204
aVwhere we actually get paid for our dyeing."
p205
aa(lp206
VIt's estimated that more than 4,000 children
p207
aVare enslaved on Lake Volta,
p208
aVthe largest man-made lake in the world.
p209
aVWhen we first arrived, I went to have a quick look.
p210
aVI saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat,
p211
aVtwo older brothers, some younger kids, makes sense right?
p212
aVWrong. They were all enslaved.
p213
aVChildren are taken from their families
p214
aVand trafficked and vanished,
p215
aVand they're forced to work endless hours on these boats
p216
aVon the lake, even though they do not know how to swim.
p217
aa(lp218
VThis young child is eight years old.
p219
aVHe was trembling when our boat approached,
p220
aVfrightened it would run over his tiny canoe.
p221
aVHe was petrified he would be knocked in the water.
p222
aVThe skeletal tree limbs submerged in Lake Volta
p223
aVoften catch the fishing nets, and weary,
p224
aVfrightened children are thrown into the water
p225
aVto untether the lines.
p226
aVMany of them drown.
p227
aa(lp228
VFor as long as he can recall, he's been forced to work
p229
aVon the lake.
p230
aVTerrified of his master, he will not run away,
p231
aVand since he's been treated with cruelty all his life,
p232
aVhe passes that down to the younger slaves
p233
aVthat he manages.
p234
aa(lp235
VI met these boys at five in the morning,
p236
aVwhen they were hauling in the last of their nets,
p237
aVbut they had been working since 1 a.m.
p238
aVin the cold, windy night.
p239
aVAnd it's important to note that these nets weigh
p240
aVmore than a thousand pounds when they're full of fish.
p241
aa(lp242
VI want to introduce you to Kofi.
p243
aVKofi was rescued from a fishing village.
p244
aVI met him at a shelter where Free the Slaves
p245
aVrehabilitates victims of slavery.
p246
aVHere he's seen taking a bath at the well,
p247
aVpouring big buckets of water over his head,
p248
aVand the wonderful news is,
p249
aVas you and I are sitting here talking today,
p250
aVKofi has been reunited with his family,
p251
aVand what's even better, his family has been given tools
p252
aVto make a living and to keep their children safe.
p253
aVKofi is the embodiment of possibility.
p254
aVWho will he become because someone took a stand
p255
aVand made a difference in his life?
p256
aa(lp257
VDriving down a road in Ghana
p258
aVwith partners of Free the Slaves,
p259
aVa fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up
p260
aVto our cruiser and tapped on the window.
p261
aVHe told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle.
p262
aVAt the end of the road, he urged us out of the car,
p263
aVand told the driver to quickly leave.
p264
aVThen he pointed toward this barely visible footpath,
p265
aVand said, "This is the path, this is the path. Go."
p266
aVAs we started down the path, we pushed aside the vines
p267
aVblocking the way, and after about an hour of walking in,
p268
aVfound that the trail had become flooded by recent rains,
p269
aVso I hoisted the photo gear above my head
p270
aVas we descended into these waters up to my chest.
p271
aVAfter another two hours of hiking, the winding trail
p272
aVabruptly ended at a clearing, and before us
p273
aVwas a mass of holes
p274
aVthat could fit into the size of a football field,
p275
aVand all of them were full of enslaved people laboring.
p276
aVMany women had children strapped to their backs
p277
aVwhile they were panning for gold,
p278
aVwading in water poisoned by mercury.
p279
aVMercury is used in the extraction process.
p280
aa(lp281
VThese miners are enslaved in a mine shaft
p282
aVin another part of Ghana.
p283
aVWhen they came out of the shaft, they were soaking wet
p284
aVfrom their own sweat.
p285
aVI remember looking into their tired, bloodshot eyes,
p286
aVfor many of them had been underground for 72 hours.
p287
aVThe shafts are up to 300 feet deep, and they carry out
p288
aVheavy bags of stone that later will be transported
p289
aVto another area, where the stone will be pounded
p290
aVso that they can extract the gold.
p291
aa(lp292
VAt first glance, the pounding site seems full
p293
aVof powerful men, but when we look closer,
p294
aVwe see some less fortunate working on the fringes,
p295
aVand children too.
p296
aVAll of them are victim to injury, illness and violence.
p297
aVIn fact, it's very likely that this muscular person
p298
aVwill end up like this one here, racked with tuberculosis
p299
aVand mercury poisoning in just a few years.
p300
aa(lp301
VThis is Manuru. When his father died,
p302
aVhis uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines.
p303
aVWhen his uncle died, Manuru inherited his uncle's debt,
p304
aVwhich further forced him into being enslaved in the mines.
p305
aVWhen I met him, he had been working in the mines
p306
aVfor 14 years, and the leg injury that you see here
p307
aVis actually from a mining accident,
p308
aVone so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated.
p309
aVOn top of that, Manuru has tuberculosis,
p310
aVyet he's still forced to work day in and day out
p311
aVin that mine shaft.
p312
aa(lp313
VEven still, he has a dream that he will become free
p314
aVand become educated with the help of local activists
p315
aVlike Free the Slaves,
p316
aVand it's this sort of determination,
p317
aVin the face of unimaginable odds,
p318
aVthat fills me with complete awe.
p319
aa(lp320
VI want to shine a light on slavery.
p321
aVWhen I was working in the field,
p322
aVI brought lots of candles with me,
p323
aVand with the help of my interpreter,
p324
aVI imparted to the people I was photographing
p325
aVthat I wanted to illuminate their stories
p326
aVand their plight,
p327
aVso when it was safe for them, and safe for me,
p328
aVI made these images.
p329
aVThey knew their image would be seen
p330
aVby you out in the world.
p331
aVI wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness
p332
aVto them, and that we will do whatever we can
p333
aVto help make a difference in their lives.
p334
aVI truly believe, if we can see one another
p335
aVas fellow human beings, then it becomes very difficult
p336
aVto tolerate atrocities like slavery.
p337
aVThese images are not of issues. They are of people,
p338
aVreal people, like you and me, all deserving
p339
aVof the same rights, dignity and respect
p340
aVin their lives.
p341
aVThere is not a day that goes by that I don't think
p342
aVof these many beautiful, mistreated people
p343
aVI've had the tremendous honor of meeting.
p344
aa(lp345
VI hope that these images awaken a force
p346
aa(lp347
Vin those who view them, people like you,
p348
aVand I hope that force will ignite a fire,
p349
aVand that fire will shine a light on slavery,
p350
aVfor without that light, the beast of bondage
p351
aVcan continue to live in the shadows.
p352
aa(lp353
VThank you very much.
p354
aa(lp355
V(Applause)

VCode is the next universal language.
p5
aVIn the seventies, it was punk music that drove the whole generation.
p6
aVIn the eighties, it was probably money.
p7
aVBut for my generation of people,
p8
aVsoftware is the interface to our imagination and our world.
p9
aVAnd that means that we need
p10
aVa radically, radically more diverse set of people
p11
aVto build those products,
p12
aVto not see computers as mechanical and lonely and boring and magic,
p13
aVto see them as things that they can tinker
p14
aVand turn around and twist, and so forth.
p15
aa(lp16
VMy personal journey into the world of programming and technology
p17
aVstarted at the tender age of 14.
p18
aVI had this mad teenage crush on an older man,
p19
aVand the older man in question just happened to be
p20
aVthe then Vice President of the United States, Mr. Al Gore.
p21
aVAnd I did what every single teenage girl would want to do.
p22
aVI wanted to somehow express all of this love,
p23
aVso I built him a website, it's over here.
p24
aVAnd in 2001, there was no Tumblr,
p25
aVthere was no Facebook, there was no Pinterest.
p26
aVSo I needed to learn to code
p27
aVin order to express all of this longing and loving.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd that is how programming started for me.
p30
aVIt started as a means of self-expression.
p31
aVJust like when I was smaller, I would use crayons and legos.
p32
aVAnd when I was older, I would use guitar lessons and theater plays.
p33
aVBut then, there were other things to get excited about,
p34
aVlike poetry and knitting socks
p35
aVand conjugating French irregular verbs
p36
aVand coming up with make-believe worlds
p37
aVand Bertrand Russell and his philosophy.
p38
aVAnd I started to be one of those people
p39
aVwho felt that computers are boring and technical and lonely.
p40
aa(lp41
VHere's what I think today.
p42
aVLittle girls don't know that they are not supposed to like computers.
p43
aVLittle girls are amazing.
p44
aVThey are really, really good at concentrating on things
p45
aVand being exact and they ask amazing questions like,
p46
aV"What?" and "Why?" and "How?" and "What if?"
p47
aVAnd they don't know that they are not supposed to like computers.
p48
aVIt's the parents who do.
p49
aVIt's us parents who feel
p50
aVlike computer science is this esoteric, weird science discipline
p51
aVthat only belongs to the mystery makers.
p52
aVThat it's almost as far removed from everyday life
p53
aVas, say, nuclear physics.
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd they are partly right about that.
p56
aVThere's a lot of syntax and controls and data structures
p57
aVand algorithms and practices,
p58
aVprotocols and paradigms in programming.
p59
aVAnd we as a community, we've made computers smaller and smaller.
p60
aVWe've built layers and layers of abstraction on top of each other
p61
aVbetween the man and the machine
p62
aVto the point that we no longer have any idea how computers work
p63
aVor how to talk to them.
p64
aVAnd we do teach our kids how the human body works,
p65
aVwe teach them how the combustion engine functions
p66
aVand we even tell them that if you want to really be an astronaut
p67
aVyou can become one.
p68
aVBut when the kid comes to us and asks,
p69
aV"So, what is a bubble sort algorithm?"
p70
aVOr, "How does the computer know what happens when I press 'play,'
p71
aVhow does it know which video to show?"
p72
aVOr, "Linda, is Internet a place?"
p73
aVWe adults, we grow oddly silent.
p74
aV"It's magic," some of us say.
p75
aV"It's too complicated," the others say.
p76
aa(lp77
VWell, it's neither.
p78
aVIt's not magic and it's not complicated.
p79
aVIt all just happened really, really, really fast.
p80
aVComputer scientists built these amazing, beautiful machines,
p81
aVbut they made them very, very foreign to us,
p82
aVand also the language we speak to the computers
p83
aVso that we don't know how to speak to the computers anymore
p84
aVwithout our fancy user interfaces.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd that's why no one recognized
p87
aVthat when I was conjugating French irregular verbs,
p88
aVI was actually practicing my pattern recognition skills.
p89
aVAnd when I was excited about knitting,
p90
aVI actually was following a sequence of symbolic commands
p91
aVthat included loops inside of them.
p92
aVAnd that Bertrand Russell's lifelong quest
p93
aVto find an exact language between English and mathematics
p94
aVfound its home inside of a computer.
p95
aVI was a programmer, but no one knew it.
p96
aa(lp97
VThe kids of today, they tap, swipe and pinch their way through the world.
p98
aVBut unless we give them tools to build with computers,
p99
aVwe are raising only consumers instead of creators.
p100
aa(lp101
VThis whole quest led me to this little girl.
p102
aVHer name is Ruby, she is six years old.
p103
aVShe is completely fearless, imaginative and a little bit bossy.
p104
aVAnd every time I would run into a problem
p105
aVin trying to teach myself programming like,
p106
aV"What is object-oriented design or what is garbage collection?",
p107
aVI would try to imagine how a six-year-old little girl would explain the problem.
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd I wrote a book about her and I illustrated it
p110
aVand the things Ruby taught me go like this.
p111
aVRuby taught me that you're not supposed to be afraid
p112
aVof the bugs under your bed.
p113
aVAnd even the biggest of the problems
p114
aVare a group of tiny problems stuck together.
p115
aVAnd Ruby also introduced me to her friends,
p116
aVthe colorful side of the Internet culture.
p117
aVShe has friends like the Snow Leopard,
p118
aVwho is beautiful but doesn't want to play with the other kids.
p119
aVAnd she has friends like the green robots that are really friendly but super messy.
p120
aVAnd she has friends like Linux the penguin
p121
aVwho's really ruthlessly efficient, but somewhat hard to understand.
p122
aVAnd idealistic foxes, and so on.
p123
aa(lp124
VIn Ruby's world, you learn technology through play.
p125
aVAnd, for instance, computers are really good at repeating stuff,
p126
aVso the way Ruby would teach loops goes like this.
p127
aVThis is Ruby's favorite dance move, it goes, "Clap, clap, stomp, stomp
p128
aVclap, clap and jump."
p129
aVAnd you learn counter loops by repeating that four times.
p130
aVAnd you learn while loops by repeating that sequence
p131
aVwhile I'm standing on one leg.
p132
aVAnd you learn until loops by repeating that sequence
p133
aVuntil mom gets really mad.
p134
aV(Laughter)
p135
aVAnd most of all, you learn that there are no ready answers.
p136
aa(lp137
VWhen coming up with the curriculum for Ruby's world,
p138
aVI needed to really ask the kids how they see the world
p139
aVand what kind of questions they have
p140
aVand I would organize play testing sessions.
p141
aVI would start by showing the kids these four pictures.
p142
aVI would show them a picture of a car,
p143
aVa grocery store, a dog and a toilet.
p144
aVAnd I would ask, "Which one of these do you think is a computer?"
p145
aVAnd the kids would be very conservative and go,
p146
aV"None of these is a computer.
p147
aVI know what a computer is:
p148
aVit's that glowing box
p149
aVin front of which mom or dad spends way too much time."
p150
aVBut then we would talk
p151
aVand we would discover that actually, a car is a computer,
p152
aVit has a navigation system inside of it.
p153
aVAnd a dog \u2014 a dog might not be a computer,
p154
aVbut it has a collar
p155
aVand the collar might have a computer inside of it.
p156
aVAnd grocery stores, they have so many different kinds of computers,
p157
aVlike the cashier system and the burglar alarms.
p158
aVAnd kids, you know what?
p159
aVIn Japan, toilets are computers
p160
aVand there's even hackers who hack them.
p161
aV(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd we go further
p164
aVand I give them these little stickers with an on/off button on them.
p165
aVAnd I tell the kids, "Today you have this magic ability
p166
aVto make anything in this room into a computer."
p167
aVAnd again, the kids go,
p168
aV"Sounds really hard, I don't know the right answer for this."
p169
aVBut I tell them, "Don't worry,
p170
aVyour parents don't know the right answer, either.
p171
aVThey've just started to hear about this thing
p172
aVcalled The Internet of Things.
p173
aVBut you kids, you are going to be the ones
p174
aVwho are really going to live up in a world where everything is a computer."
p175
aa(lp176
VAnd then I had this little girl who came to me
p177
aVand took a bicycle lamp
p178
aVand she said, "This bicycle lamp, if it were a computer,
p179
aVit would change colors."
p180
aVAnd I said, "That's a really good idea, what else could it do?"
p181
aVAnd she thinks and she thinks,
p182
aVand she goes, "If this bicycle lamp were a computer,
p183
aVwe could go on a biking trip with my father
p184
aVand we would sleep in a tent
p185
aVand this biking lamp could also be a movie projector."
p186
aVAnd that's the moment I'm looking for,
p187
aVthe moment when the kid realizes
p188
aVthat the world is definitely not ready yet,
p189
aVthat a really awesome way of making the world more ready
p190
aVis by building technology
p191
aVand that each one of us can be a part of that change.
p192
aa(lp193
VFinal story, we also built a computer.
p194
aVAnd we got to know the bossy CPU and the helpful RAM and ROM
p195
aVthat help it remember things.
p196
aVAnd after we've assembled our computer together,
p197
aVwe also design an application for it.
p198
aVAnd my favorite story is this little boy,
p199
aVhe's six years old
p200
aVand his favorite thing in the world is to be an astronaut.
p201
aVAnd the boy, he has these huge headphones on
p202
aVand he's completely immersed in his tiny paper computer
p203
aVbecause you see, he's built his own
p204
aVintergalactic planetary navigation application.
p205
aVAnd his father, the lone astronaut in the Martian orbit,
p206
aVis on the other side of the room
p207
aVand the boy's important mission
p208
aVis to bring the father safely back to earth.
p209
aVAnd these kids are going to have a profoundly different view of the world
p210
aVand the way we build it with technology.
p211
aa(lp212
VFinally, the more approachable, the more inclusive,
p213
aVand the more diverse we make the world of technology,
p214
aVthe more colorful and better the world will look like.
p215
aVSo, imagine with me, for a moment,
p216
aVa world where the stories we tell
p217
aVabout how things get made don't only include
p218
aVthe twentysomething-year-old Silicon Valley boys,
p219
aVbut also Kenyan schoolgirls and Norwegian librarians.
p220
aVImagine a world where the little Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow,
p221
aVwho live in a permanent reality of 1s and 0s,
p222
aVthey grow up to be very optimistic and brave about technology.
p223
aVThey embrace the powers and the opportunities
p224
aVand the limitations of the world.
p225
aVA world of technology that is wonderful, whimsical
p226
aVand a tiny bit weird.
p227
aa(lp228
VWhen I was a girl,
p229
aVI wanted to be a storyteller.
p230
aVI loved make-believe worlds
p231
aVand my favorite thing to do
p232
aVwas to wake up in the mornings in Moominvalley.
p233
aVIn the afternoons, I would roam around the Tatooines.
p234
aVAnd in the evenings, I would go to sleep in Narnia.
p235
aVAnd programming turned out to be the perfect profession for me.
p236
aVI still create worlds.
p237
aVInstead of stories, I do them with code.
p238
aa(lp239
VProgramming gives me this amazing power
p240
aVto build my whole little universe
p241
aVwith its own rules and paradigms and practices.
p242
aVCreate something out of nothing with the pure power of logic.
p243
aa(lp244
VThank you.
p245
aa(lp246
V(Applause)

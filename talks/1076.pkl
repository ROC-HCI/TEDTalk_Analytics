VI've been spending a lot of time
p5
aVtraveling around the world these days,
p6
aVtalking to groups of students and professionals,
p7
aVand everywhere I'm finding that I hear similar themes.
p8
aVOn the one hand, people say,
p9
aV"The time for change is now."
p10
aVThey want to be part of it.
p11
aVThey talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning.
p12
aVBut on the other hand,
p13
aVI hear people talking about fear,
p14
aVa sense of risk-aversion.
p15
aVThey say, "I really want to follow a life of purpose,
p16
aVbut I don't know where to start.
p17
aVI don't want to disappoint my family or friends."
p18
aVI work in global poverty.
p19
aVAnd they say, "I want to work in global poverty,
p20
aVbut what will it mean about my career?
p21
aVWill I be marginalized?
p22
aVWill I not make enough money?
p23
aVWill I never get married or have children?"
p24
aVAnd as a woman who didn't get married until I was a lot older \u2014
p25
aVand I'm glad I waited \u2014
p26
aV(Laughter)
p27
aV\u2014 and has no children,
p28
aVI look at these young people
p29
aVand I say, "Your job is not to be perfect.
p30
aVYour job is only to be human.
p31
aVAnd nothing important happens in life
p32
aVwithout a cost."
p33
aVThese conversations really reflect what's happening
p34
aVat the national and international level.
p35
aVOur leaders and ourselves
p36
aVwant everything,
p37
aVbut we don't talk about the costs.
p38
aVWe don't talk about the sacrifice.
p39
aa(lp40
VOne of my favorite quotes from literature
p41
aVwas written by Tillie Olsen,
p42
aVthe great American writer from the South.
p43
aVIn a short story called "Oh Yes,"
p44
aVshe talks about a white woman in the 1950s
p45
aVwho has a daughter
p46
aVwho befriends a little African American girl,
p47
aVand she looks at her child with a sense of pride,
p48
aVbut she also wonders,
p49
aVwhat price will she pay?
p50
aV"Better immersion
p51
aVthan to live untouched."
p52
aVBut the real question is,
p53
aVwhat is the cost of not daring?
p54
aVWhat is the cost of not trying?
p55
aa(lp56
VI've been so privileged in my life
p57
aVto know extraordinary leaders
p58
aVwho have chosen to live lives of immersion.
p59
aVOne woman I knew who was a fellow
p60
aVat a program that I ran at the Rockefeller Foundation
p61
aVwas named Ingrid Washinawatok.
p62
aVShe was a leader of the Menominee tribe,
p63
aVa Native American peoples.
p64
aVAnd when we would gather as fellows,
p65
aVshe would push us to think about
p66
aVhow the elders in Native American culture
p67
aVmake decisions.
p68
aVAnd she said they would literally visualize
p69
aVthe faces of children
p70
aVfor seven generations into the future,
p71
aVlooking at them from the Earth,
p72
aVand they would look at them, holding them as stewards
p73
aVfor that future.
p74
aVIngrid understood that we are connected to each other,
p75
aVnot only as human beings,
p76
aVbut to every living thing on the planet.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd tragically, in 1999,
p79
aVwhen she was in Colombia
p80
aVworking with the U'wa people,
p81
aVfocused on preserving their culture and language,
p82
aVshe and two colleagues were abducted
p83
aVand tortured and killed by the FARC.
p84
aVAnd whenever we would gather the fellows after that,
p85
aVwe would leave a chair empty for her spirit.
p86
aVAnd more than a decade later,
p87
aVwhen I talk to NGO fellows,
p88
aVwhether in Trenton, New Jersey or the office of the White House,
p89
aVand we talk about Ingrid,
p90
aVthey all say that they're trying to integrate her wisdom
p91
aVand her spirit
p92
aVand really build on the unfulfilled work
p93
aVof her life's mission.
p94
aVAnd when we think about legacy,
p95
aVI can think of no more powerful one,
p96
aVdespite how short her life was.
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd I've been touched by Cambodian women \u2014
p99
aVbeautiful women,
p100
aVwomen who held the tradition of the classical dance in Cambodia.
p101
aVAnd I met them in the early '90s.
p102
aVIn the 1970s, under the Pol Pot regime,
p103
aVthe Khmer Rouge killed over a million people,
p104
aVand they focused and targeted the elites and the intellectuals,
p105
aVthe artists, the dancers.
p106
aVAnd at the end of the war,
p107
aVthere were only 30 of these classical dancers still living.
p108
aVAnd the women, who I was so privileged to meet
p109
aVwhen there were three survivors,
p110
aVtold these stories about lying in their cots
p111
aVin the refugee camps.
p112
aVThey said they would try so hard
p113
aVto remember the fragments of the dance,
p114
aVhoping that others were alive and doing the same.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd one woman stood there with this perfect carriage,
p117
aVher hands at her side,
p118
aVand she talked about
p119
aVthe reunion of the 30 after the war
p120
aVand how extraordinary it was.
p121
aVAnd these big tears fell down her face,
p122
aVbut she never lifted her hands to move them.
p123
aVAnd the women decided that they would train
p124
aVnot the next generation of girls, because they had grown too old already,
p125
aVbut the next generation.
p126
aVAnd I sat there in the studio
p127
aVwatching these women clapping their hands \u2014
p128
aVbeautiful rhythms \u2014
p129
aVas these little fairy pixies
p130
aVwere dancing around them,
p131
aVwearing these beautiful silk colors.
p132
aVAnd I thought, after all this atrocity,
p133
aVthis is how human beings really pray.
p134
aVBecause they're focused on honoring
p135
aVwhat is most beautiful about our past
p136
aVand building it into
p137
aVthe promise of our future.
p138
aVAnd what these women understood
p139
aVis sometimes the most important things that we do
p140
aVand that we spend our time on
p141
aVare those things that we cannot measure.
p142
aa(lp143
VI also have been touched
p144
aVby the dark side of power and leadership.
p145
aVAnd I have learned that power,
p146
aVparticularly in its absolute form,
p147
aVis an equal opportunity provider.
p148
aVIn 1986, I moved to Rwanda,
p149
aVand I worked with a very small group of Rwandan women
p150
aVto start that country's first microfinance bank.
p151
aVAnd one of the women was Agnes \u2014
p152
aVthere on your extreme left \u2014
p153
aVshe was one of the first three
p154
aVwomen parliamentarians in Rwanda,
p155
aVand her legacy should have been
p156
aVto be one of the mothers of Rwanda.
p157
aVWe built this institution based on social justice,
p158
aVgender equity,
p159
aVthis idea of empowering women.
p160
aa(lp161
VBut Agnes cared more about the trappings of power
p162
aVthan she did principle at the end.
p163
aVAnd though she had been part of building a liberal party,
p164
aVa political party
p165
aVthat was focused on diversity and tolerance,
p166
aVabout three months before the genocide, she switched parties
p167
aVand joined the extremist party, Hutu Power,
p168
aVand she became the Minister of Justice
p169
aVunder the genocide regime
p170
aVand was known for inciting men to kill faster
p171
aVand stop behaving like women.
p172
aVShe was convicted
p173
aVof category one crimes of genocide.
p174
aVAnd I would visit her in the prisons,
p175
aVsitting side-by-side, knees touching,
p176
aVand I would have to admit to myself
p177
aVthat monsters exist in all of us,
p178
aVbut that maybe it's not monsters so much,
p179
aVbut the broken parts of ourselves,
p180
aVsadnesses, secret shame,
p181
aVand that ultimately it's easy for demagogues
p182
aVto prey on those parts,
p183
aVthose fragments, if you will,
p184
aVand to make us look at other beings, human beings,
p185
aVas lesser than ourselves \u2014
p186
aVand in the extreme, to do terrible things.
p187
aa(lp188
VAnd there is no group
p189
aVmore vulnerable to those kinds of manipulations
p190
aVthan young men.
p191
aVI've heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet
p192
aVis the adolescent male.
p193
aVAnd so in a gathering
p194
aVwhere we're focused on women,
p195
aVwhile it is so critical that we invest in our girls
p196
aVand we even the playing field
p197
aVand we find ways to honor them,
p198
aVwe have to remember that the girls and the women
p199
aVare most isolated and violated
p200
aVand victimized and made invisible
p201
aVin those very societies
p202
aVwhere our men and our boys
p203
aVfeel disempowered,
p204
aVunable to provide.
p205
aVAnd that, when they sit on those street corners
p206
aVand all they can think of in the future
p207
aVis no job, no education,
p208
aVno possibility,
p209
aVwell then it's easy to understand
p210
aVhow the greatest source of status
p211
aVcan come from a uniform
p212
aVand a gun.
p213
aa(lp214
VSometimes very small investments
p215
aVcan release enormous, infinite potential
p216
aVthat exists in all of us.
p217
aVOne of the Acumen Fund fellows at my organization,
p218
aVSuraj Sudhakar,
p219
aVhas what we call moral imagination \u2014
p220
aVthe ability to put yourself in another person's shoes
p221
aVand lead from that perspective.
p222
aVAnd he's been working with this young group of men
p223
aVwho come from the largest slum in the world, Kibera.
p224
aVAnd they're incredible guys.
p225
aVAnd together they started a book club
p226
aVfor a hundred people in the slums,
p227
aVand they're reading many TED authors and liking it.
p228
aVAnd then they created a business plan competition.
p229
aVThen they decided that they would do TEDx's.
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd I have learned so much
p232
aVfrom Chris and Kevin
p233
aVand Alex and Herbert
p234
aVand all of these young men.
p235
aVAlex, in some ways, said it best.
p236
aVHe said, "We used to feel like nobodies,
p237
aVbut now we feel like somebodies."
p238
aVAnd I think we have it all wrong
p239
aVwhen we think that income is the link.
p240
aVWhat we really yearn for as human beings
p241
aVis to be visible to each other.
p242
aVAnd the reason these young guys
p243
aVtold me that they're doing these TEDx's
p244
aVis because they were sick and tired
p245
aVof the only workshops coming to the slums
p246
aVbeing those workshops focused on HIV,
p247
aVor at best, microfinance.
p248
aVAnd they wanted to celebrate
p249
aVwhat's beautiful about Kibera and Mathare \u2014
p250
aVthe photojournalists and the creatives,
p251
aVthe graffiti artists, the teachers and the entrepreneurs.
p252
aVAnd they're doing it.
p253
aVAnd my hat's off to you in Kibera.
p254
aa(lp255
VMy own work focuses
p256
aVon making philanthropy more effective
p257
aVand capitalism more inclusive.
p258
aVAt Acumen Fund, we take philanthropic resources
p259
aVand we invest what we call patient capital \u2014
p260
aVmoney that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor
p261
aVnot as passive recipients of charity,
p262
aVbut as full-bodied agents of change
p263
aVwho want to solve their own problems
p264
aVand make their own decisions.
p265
aVWe leave our money for 10 to 15 years,
p266
aVand when we get it back, we invest in other innovations
p267
aVthat focus on change.
p268
aVI know it works.
p269
aVWe've invested more than 50 million dollars in 50 companies,
p270
aVand those companies have brought another 200 million dollars
p271
aVinto these forgotten markets.
p272
aVThis year alone, they've delivered 40 million services
p273
aVlike maternal health care and housing,
p274
aVemergency services, solar energy,
p275
aVso that people can have more dignity
p276
aVin solving their problems.
p277
aa(lp278
VPatient capital is uncomfortable
p279
aVfor people searching for simple solutions,
p280
aVeasy categories,
p281
aVbecause we don't see profit as a blunt instrument.
p282
aVBut we find those entrepreneurs
p283
aVwho put people and the planet
p284
aVbefore profit.
p285
aVAnd ultimately, we want to be part of a movement
p286
aVthat is about measuring impact,
p287
aVmeasuring what is most important to us.
p288
aVAnd my dream is we'll have a world one day
p289
aVwhere we don't just honor those who take money
p290
aVand make more money from it,
p291
aVbut we find those individuals who take our resources
p292
aVand convert it into changing the world
p293
aVin the most positive ways.
p294
aVAnd it's only when we honor them
p295
aVand celebrate them and give them status
p296
aVthat the world will really change.
p297
aa(lp298
VLast May I had this extraordinary 24-hour period
p299
aVwhere I saw two visions of the world
p300
aVliving side-by-side \u2014
p301
aVone based on violence
p302
aVand the other on transcendence.
p303
aVI happened to be in Lahore, Pakistan
p304
aVon the day that two mosques were attacked
p305
aVby suicide bombers.
p306
aVAnd the reason these mosques were attacked
p307
aVis because the people praying inside
p308
aVwere from a particular sect of Islam
p309
aVwho fundamentalists don't believe are fully Muslim.
p310
aVAnd not only did those suicide bombers
p311
aVtake a hundred lives,
p312
aVbut they did more,
p313
aVbecause they created more hatred, more rage, more fear
p314
aVand certainly despair.
p315
aa(lp316
VBut less than 24 hours,
p317
aVI was 13 miles away from those mosques,
p318
aVvisiting one of our Acumen investees,
p319
aVan incredible man, Jawad Aslam,
p320
aVwho dares to live a life of immersion.
p321
aVBorn and raised in Baltimore,
p322
aVhe studied real estate, worked in commercial real estate,
p323
aVand after 9/11 decided he was going to Pakistan to make a difference.
p324
aVFor two years, he hardly made any money, a tiny stipend,
p325
aVbut he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer
p326
aVnamed Tasneem Saddiqui.
p327
aVAnd he had a dream that he would build a housing community
p328
aVon this barren piece of land
p329
aVusing patient capital,
p330
aVbut he continued to pay a price.
p331
aVHe stood on moral ground
p332
aVand refused to pay bribes.
p333
aVIt took almost two years just to register the land.
p334
aVBut I saw how the level of moral standard can rise
p335
aVfrom one person's action.
p336
aa(lp337
VToday, 2,000 people live in 300 houses
p338
aVin this beautiful community.
p339
aVAnd there's schools and clinics and shops.
p340
aVBut there's only one mosque.
p341
aVAnd so I asked Jawad,
p342
aV"How do you guys navigate? This is a really diverse community.
p343
aVWho gets to use the mosque on Fridays?"
p344
aVHe said, "Long story.
p345
aVIt was hard, it was a difficult road,
p346
aVbut ultimately the leaders of the community came together,
p347
aVrealizing we only have each other.
p348
aVAnd we decided that we would elect
p349
aVthe three most respected imams,
p350
aVand those imams would take turns,
p351
aVthey would rotate who would say Friday prayer.
p352
aVBut the whole community,
p353
aVall the different sects, including Shi'a and Sunni,
p354
aVwould sit together and pray."
p355
aa(lp356
VWe need that kind of moral leadership and courage
p357
aVin our worlds.
p358
aVWe face huge issues as a world \u2014
p359
aVthe financial crisis,
p360
aVglobal warming
p361
aVand this growing sense of fear and otherness.
p362
aVAnd every day we have a choice.
p363
aVWe can take the easier road,
p364
aVthe more cynical road,
p365
aVwhich is a road based on
p366
aVsometimes dreams of a past that never really was,
p367
aVa fear of each other,
p368
aVdistancing and blame.
p369
aVOr we can take the much more difficult path
p370
aVof transformation, transcendence,
p371
aVcompassion and love,
p372
aVbut also accountability and justice.
p373
aa(lp374
VI had the great honor
p375
aVof working with the child psychologist Dr. Robert Coles,
p376
aVwho stood up for change
p377
aVduring the Civil Rights movement in the United States.
p378
aVAnd he tells this incredible story
p379
aVabout working with a little six-year-old girl named Ruby Bridges,
p380
aVthe first child to desegregate schools in the South \u2014
p381
aVin this case, New Orleans.
p382
aVAnd he said that every day
p383
aVthis six-year-old, dressed in her beautiful dress,
p384
aVwould walk with real grace
p385
aVthrough a phalanx of white people
p386
aVscreaming angrily, calling her a monster,
p387
aVthreatening to poison her \u2014
p388
aVdistorted faces.
p389
aVAnd every day he would watch her,
p390
aVand it looked like she was talking to the people.
p391
aVAnd he would say, "Ruby, what are you saying?"
p392
aVAnd she'd say, "I'm not talking."
p393
aVAnd finally he said, "Ruby, I see that you're talking.
p394
aVWhat are you saying?"
p395
aVAnd she said, "Dr. Coles, I am not talking;
p396
aVI'm praying."
p397
aVAnd he said, "Well, what are you praying?"
p398
aVAnd she said, "I'm praying, 'Father, forgive them,
p399
aVfor they know not what they are doing.'"
p400
aVAt age six,
p401
aVthis child was living a life of immersion,
p402
aVand her family paid a price for it.
p403
aVBut she became part of history
p404
aVand opened up this idea
p405
aVthat all of us should have access to education.
p406
aa(lp407
VMy final story is about a young, beautiful man
p408
aVnamed Josephat Byaruhanga,
p409
aVwho was another Acumen Fund fellow,
p410
aVwho hails from Uganda, a farming community.
p411
aVAnd we placed him in a company in Western Kenya,
p412
aVjust 200 miles away.
p413
aVAnd he said to me at the end of his year,
p414
aV"Jacqueline, it was so humbling,
p415
aVbecause I thought as a farmer and as an African
p416
aVI would understand how to transcend culture.
p417
aVBut especially when I was talking to the African women,
p418
aVI sometimes made these mistakes \u2014
p419
aVit was so hard for me to learn how to listen."
p420
aVAnd he said, "So I conclude that, in many ways,
p421
aVleadership is like a panicle of rice.
p422
aVBecause at the height of the season,
p423
aVat the height of its powers,
p424
aVit's beautiful, it's green, it nourishes the world,
p425
aVit reaches to the heavens."
p426
aVAnd he said, "But right before the harvest,
p427
aVit bends over
p428
aVwith great gratitude and humility
p429
aVto touch the earth from where it came."
p430
aa(lp431
VWe need leaders.
p432
aVWe ourselves need to lead
p433
aVfrom a place that has the audacity
p434
aVto believe we can, ourselves,
p435
aVextend the fundamental assumption
p436
aVthat all men are created equal
p437
aVto every man, woman and child on this planet.
p438
aVAnd we need to have the humility to recognize
p439
aVthat we cannot do it alone.
p440
aVRobert Kennedy once said
p441
aVthat "few of us have the greatness to bend history itself,
p442
aVbut each of us can work
p443
aVto change a small portion of events."
p444
aVAnd it is in the total of all those acts
p445
aVthat the history of this generation will be written.
p446
aVOur lives are so short,
p447
aVand our time on this planet
p448
aVis so precious,
p449
aVand all we have is each other.
p450
aVSo may each of you
p451
aVlive lives of immersion.
p452
aVThey won't necessarily be easy lives,
p453
aVbut in the end, it is all that will sustain us.
p454
aa(lp455
VThank you.

So I moved to Rwanda in 1986 to help found the country&rsquo;s first micro-finance bank.  There I saw the humanitarian ethos of philanthropy, and also how often top-down solutions too often create dependency, the opposite of dignity. Through 30 years of working on solutions to poverty, I have come to redefine it for myself, seeing it not as how much income a person earns, but how free they are to make their own choices and decisions, how much agency they have over their own lives.  <br /> <br />Acumen was founded to change the way the world tackles poverty in 2001.  Our mission was simple &ndash; to raise philanthropy and  invest it as patient capital &ndash; long-term investment in intrepid entrepreneurs willing to go where markets and government had failed the poor.  We enable companies to experiment and fail, never wavering from a commitment to stand with the poor, yet understanding that profitability is necessary for sustainable solutions. We&rsquo;ve invested more than $110M across South Asia, Africa, Latin America and the US, and have seen entire sectors disrupted and hundreds of millions served.  <br /> <br />The work also taught that it was critical to invest in talent. To date, we&rsquo;ve supported nearly 400 Acumen Fellows across lines of race, class, ethnicity, religion and ideology.  They are a beautiful group, full of vision and grit, and a determination to do what is right, not easy. The group itself enables individual leaders to endure the loneliness that is part of the work.<br /> <br />And then we measure what matters rather than just what we can count. Take this all together and you see our mission to do what it takes to build a world in which all of us have the chance to dream and to flourish, not from a place of easy sentimentality but through a commitment to using the tools of capitalism and the attributes of moral leadership to focus on doing what it takes, and no less. </p>", "slug": "jacqueline_novogratz", "whotheyare": "Jacqueline Novogratz works to enable human flourishing.

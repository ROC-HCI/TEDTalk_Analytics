VChris Anderson: You were something of a mathematical phenom.
p5
aVYou had already taught at Harvard and MIT at a young age.
p6
aVAnd then the NSA came calling.
p7
aVWhat was that about?
p8
aa(lp9
VJim Simons: Well the NSA \u2014 that's the National Security Agency \u2014
p10
aVthey didn't exactly come calling.
p11
aVThey had an operation at Princeton, where they hired mathematicians
p12
aVto attack secret codes and stuff like that.
p13
aVAnd I knew that existed.
p14
aVAnd they had a very good policy,
p15
aVbecause you could do half your time at your own mathematics,
p16
aVand at least half your time working on their stuff.
p17
aVAnd they paid a lot.
p18
aVSo that was an irresistible pull.
p19
aVSo, I went there.
p20
aa(lp21
VCA: You were a code-cracker.
p22
aa(lp23
VJS: I was.
p24
aa(lp25
VCA: Until you got fired.
p26
aa(lp27
VJS: Well, I did get fired. Yes.
p28
aa(lp29
VCA: How come?
p30
aa(lp31
VJS: Well, how come?
p32
aVI got fired because, well, the Vietnam War was on,
p33
aVand the boss of bosses in my organization was a big fan of the war
p34
aVand wrote a New York Times article, a magazine section cover story,
p35
aVabout how we would win in Vietnam.
p36
aVAnd I didn't like that war, I thought it was stupid.
p37
aVAnd I wrote a letter to the Times, which they published,
p38
aVsaying not everyone who works for Maxwell Taylor,
p39
aVif anyone remembers that name, agrees with his views.
p40
aVAnd I gave my own views ...
p41
aa(lp42
VCA: Oh, OK. I can see that would \u2014
p43
aa(lp44
VJS: ... which were different from General Taylor's.
p45
aVBut in the end, nobody said anything.
p46
aVBut then, I was 29 years old at this time, and some kid came around
p47
aVand said he was a stringer from Newsweek magazine
p48
aVand he wanted to interview me and ask what I was doing about my views.
p49
aVAnd I told him, "I'm doing mostly mathematics now,
p50
aVand when the war is over, then I'll do mostly their stuff."
p51
aVThen I did the only intelligent thing I'd done that day \u2014
p52
aVI told my local boss that I gave that interview.
p53
aVAnd he said, "What'd you say?"
p54
aVAnd I told him what I said.
p55
aVAnd then he said, "I've got to call Taylor."
p56
aVHe called Taylor; that took 10 minutes.
p57
aVI was fired five minutes after that.
p58
aa(lp59
VCA: OK.
p60
aa(lp61
VJS: But it wasn't bad.
p62
aa(lp63
VCA: It wasn't bad, because you went on to Stony Brook
p64
aVand stepped up your mathematical career.
p65
aVYou started working with this man here.
p66
aVWho is this?
p67
aa(lp68
VJS: Oh, [Shiing-Shen] Chern.
p69
aVChern was one of the great mathematicians of the century.
p70
aVI had known him when I was a graduate student at Berkeley.
p71
aVAnd I had some ideas,
p72
aVand I brought them to him and he liked them.
p73
aVTogether, we did this work which you can easily see up there.
p74
aVThere it is.
p75
aa(lp76
VCA: It led to you publishing a famous paper together.
p77
aVCan you explain at all what that work was?
p78
aa(lp79
VJS: No.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VJS: I mean, I could explain it to somebody.
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VCA: How about explaining this?
p88
aa(lp89
VJS: But not many. Not many people.
p90
aa(lp91
VCA: I think you told me it had something to do with spheres,
p92
aVso let's start here.
p93
aa(lp94
VJS: Well, it did, but I'll say about that work \u2014
p95
aVit did have something to do with that, but before we get to that \u2014
p96
aVthat work was good mathematics.
p97
aVI was very happy with it; so was Chern.
p98
aVIt even started a little sub-field that's now flourishing.
p99
aVBut, more interestingly, it happened to apply to physics,
p100
aVsomething we knew nothing about \u2014 at least I knew nothing about physics,
p101
aVand I don't think Chern knew a heck of a lot.
p102
aVAnd about 10 years after the paper came out,
p103
aVa guy named Ed Witten in Princeton started applying it to string theory
p104
aVand people in Russia started applying it to what's called "condensed matter."
p105
aVToday, those things in there called Chern-Simons invariants
p106
aVhave spread through a lot of physics.
p107
aVAnd it was amazing.
p108
aVWe didn't know any physics.
p109
aVIt never occurred to me that it would be applied to physics.
p110
aVBut that's the thing about mathematics \u2014 you never know where it's going to go.
p111
aa(lp112
VCA: This is so incredible.
p113
aVSo, we've been talking about how evolution shapes human minds
p114
aVthat may or may not perceive the truth.
p115
aVSomehow, you come up with a mathematical theory,
p116
aVnot knowing any physics,
p117
aVdiscover two decades later that it's being applied
p118
aVto profoundly describe the actual physical world.
p119
aVHow can that happen?
p120
aa(lp121
VJS: God knows.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
VBut there's a famous physicist named [Eugene] Wigner,
p126
aVand he wrote an essay on the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.
p127
aVSomehow, this mathematics, which is rooted in the real world
p128
aVin some sense \u2014 we learn to count, measure, everyone would do that \u2014
p129
aVand then it flourishes on its own.
p130
aVBut so often it comes back to save the day.
p131
aVGeneral relativity is an example.
p132
aV[Hermann] Minkowski had this geometry, and Einstein realized,
p133
aV"Hey! It's the very thing in which I can cast general relativity."
p134
aVSo, you never know. It is a mystery.
p135
aVIt is a mystery.
p136
aa(lp137
VCA: So, here's a mathematical piece of ingenuity.
p138
aVTell us about this.
p139
aa(lp140
VJS: Well, that's a ball \u2014 it's a sphere, and it has a lattice around it \u2014
p141
aVyou know, those squares.
p142
aVWhat I'm going to show here was originally observed by [Leonhard] Euler,
p143
aVthe great mathematician, in the 1700s.
p144
aVAnd it gradually grew to be a very important field in mathematics:
p145
aValgebraic topology, geometry.
p146
aVThat paper up there had its roots in this.
p147
aVSo, here's this thing:
p148
aVit has eight vertices, 12 edges, six faces.
p149
aVAnd if you look at the difference \u2014 vertices minus edges plus faces \u2014
p150
aVyou get two.
p151
aVOK, well, two. That's a good number.
p152
aVHere's a different way of doing it \u2014 these are triangles covering \u2014
p153
aVthis has 12 vertices and 30 edges
p154
aVand 20 faces, 20 tiles.
p155
aVAnd vertices minus edges plus faces still equals two.
p156
aVAnd in fact, you could do this any which way \u2014
p157
aVcover this thing with all kinds of polygons and triangles
p158
aVand mix them up.
p159
aVAnd you take vertices minus edges plus faces \u2014 you'll get two.
p160
aVHere's a different shape.
p161
aVThis is a torus, or the surface of a doughnut: 16 vertices
p162
aVcovered by these rectangles, 32 edges, 16 faces.
p163
aVVertices minus edges comes out to be zero.
p164
aVIt'll always come out to zero.
p165
aVEvery time you cover a torus with squares or triangles
p166
aVor anything like that, you're going to get zero.
p167
aVSo, this is called the Euler characteristic.
p168
aVAnd it's what's called a topological invariant.
p169
aVIt's pretty amazing.
p170
aVNo matter how you do it, you're always get the same answer.
p171
aVSo that was the first sort of thrust, from the mid-1700s,
p172
aVinto a subject which is now called algebraic topology.
p173
aa(lp174
VCA: And your own work took an idea like this and moved it
p175
aVinto higher-dimensional theory,
p176
aVhigher-dimensional objects, and found new invariances?
p177
aa(lp178
VJS: Yes. Well, there were already higher-dimensional invariants:
p179
aVPontryagin classes \u2014 actually, there were Chern classes.
p180
aVThere were a bunch of these types of invariants.
p181
aVI was struggling to work on one of them
p182
aVand model it sort of combinatorially,
p183
aVinstead of the way it was typically done,
p184
aVand that led to this work and we uncovered some new things.
p185
aVBut if it wasn't for Mr. Euler \u2014
p186
aVwho wrote almost 70 volumes of mathematics
p187
aVand had 13 children,
p188
aVwho he apparently would dandle on his knee while he was writing \u2014
p189
aVif it wasn't for Mr. Euler, there wouldn't perhaps be these invariants.
p190
aa(lp191
VCA: OK, so that's at least given us a flavor of that amazing mind in there.
p192
aVLet's talk about Renaissance.
p193
aVBecause you took that amazing mind and having been a code-cracker at the NSA,
p194
aVyou started to become a code-cracker in the financial industry.
p195
aVI think you probably didn't buy efficient market theory.
p196
aVSomehow you found a way of creating astonishing returns over two decades.
p197
aVThe way it's been explained to me,
p198
aVwhat's remarkable about what you did wasn't just the size of the returns,
p199
aVit's that you took them with surprisingly low volatility and risk,
p200
aVcompared with other hedge funds.
p201
aVSo how on earth did you do this, Jim?
p202
aa(lp203
VJS: I did it by assembling a wonderful group of people.
p204
aVWhen I started doing trading, I had gotten a little tired of mathematics.
p205
aVI was in my late 30s, I had a little money.
p206
aVI started trading and it went very well.
p207
aVI made quite a lot of money with pure luck.
p208
aVI mean, I think it was pure luck.
p209
aVIt certainly wasn't mathematical modeling.
p210
aVBut in looking at the data, after a while I realized:
p211
aVit looks like there's some structure here.
p212
aVAnd I hired a few mathematicians, and we started making some models \u2014
p213
aVjust the kind of thing we did back at IDA [Institute for Defense Analyses].
p214
aVYou design an algorithm, you test it out on a computer.
p215
aVDoes it work? Doesn't it work? And so on.
p216
aa(lp217
VCA: Can we take a look at this?
p218
aVBecause here's a typical graph of some commodity.
p219
aVI look at that, and I say, "That's just a random, up-and-down walk \u2014
p220
aVmaybe a slight upward trend over that whole period of time."
p221
aVHow on earth could you trade looking at that,
p222
aVand see something that wasn't just random?
p223
aa(lp224
VJS: In the old days \u2014 this is kind of a graph from the old days,
p225
aVcommodities or currencies had a tendency to trend.
p226
aVNot necessarily the very light trend you see here, but trending in periods.
p227
aVAnd if you decided, OK, I'm going to predict today,
p228
aVby the average move in the past 20 days \u2014
p229
aVmaybe that would be a good prediction, and I'd make some money.
p230
aVAnd in fact, years ago, such a system would work \u2014
p231
aVnot beautifully, but it would work.
p232
aVYou'd make money, you'd lose money, you'd make money.
p233
aVBut this is a year's worth of days,
p234
aVand you'd make a little money during that period.
p235
aVIt's a very vestigial system.
p236
aa(lp237
VCA: So you would test a bunch of lengths of trends in time
p238
aVand see whether, for example,
p239
aVa 10-day trend or a 15-day trend was predictive of what happened next.
p240
aa(lp241
VJS: Sure, you would try all those things and see what worked best.
p242
aVTrend-following would have been great in the '60s,
p243
aVand it was sort of OK in the '70s.
p244
aVBy the '80s, it wasn't.
p245
aa(lp246
VCA: Because everyone could see that.
p247
aVSo, how did you stay ahead of the pack?
p248
aa(lp249
VJS: We stayed ahead of the pack by finding other approaches \u2014
p250
aVshorter-term approaches to some extent.
p251
aVThe real thing was to gather a tremendous amount of data \u2014
p252
aVand we had to get it by hand in the early days.
p253
aVWe went down to the Federal Reserve and copied interest rate histories
p254
aVand stuff like that, because it didn't exist on computers.
p255
aVWe got a lot of data.
p256
aVAnd very smart people \u2014 that was the key.
p257
aVI didn't really know how to hire people to do fundamental trading.
p258
aVI had hired a few \u2014 some made money, some didn't make money.
p259
aVI couldn't make a business out of that.
p260
aVBut I did know how to hire scientists,
p261
aVbecause I have some taste in that department.
p262
aVSo, that's what we did.
p263
aVAnd gradually these models got better and better,
p264
aVand better and better.
p265
aa(lp266
VCA: You're credited with doing something remarkable at Renaissance,
p267
aVwhich is building this culture, this group of people,
p268
aVwho weren't just hired guns who could be lured away by money.
p269
aVTheir motivation was doing exciting mathematics and science.
p270
aa(lp271
VJS: Well, I'd hoped that might be true.
p272
aVBut some of it was money.
p273
aa(lp274
VCA: They made a lot of money.
p275
aa(lp276
VJS: I can't say that no one came because of the money.
p277
aVI think a lot of them came because of the money.
p278
aVBut they also came because it would be fun.
p279
aa(lp280
VCA: What role did machine learning play in all this?
p281
aa(lp282
VJS: In a certain sense, what we did was machine learning.
p283
aVYou look at a lot of data, and you try to simulate different predictive schemes,
p284
aVuntil you get better and better at it.
p285
aVIt doesn't necessarily feed back on itself the way we did things.
p286
aVBut it worked.
p287
aa(lp288
VCA: So these different predictive schemes can be really quite wild and unexpected.
p289
aVI mean, you looked at everything, right?
p290
aVYou looked at the weather, length of dresses, political opinion.
p291
aa(lp292
VJS: Yes, length of dresses we didn't try.
p293
aa(lp294
VCA: What sort of things?
p295
aa(lp296
VJS: Well, everything.
p297
aVEverything is grist for the mill \u2014 except hem lengths.
p298
aVWeather, annual reports,
p299
aVquarterly reports, historic data itself, volumes, you name it.
p300
aVWhatever there is.
p301
aVWe take in terabytes of data a day.
p302
aVAnd store it away and massage it and get it ready for analysis.
p303
aVYou're looking for anomalies.
p304
aVYou're looking for \u2014 like you said,
p305
aVthe efficient market hypothesis is not correct.
p306
aa(lp307
VCA: But any one anomaly might be just a random thing.
p308
aVSo, is the secret here to just look at multiple strange anomalies,
p309
aVand see when they align?
p310
aa(lp311
VJS: Any one anomaly might be a random thing;
p312
aVhowever, if you have enough data you can tell that it's not.
p313
aVYou can see an anomaly that's persistent for a sufficiently long time \u2014
p314
aVthe probability of it being random is not high.
p315
aVBut these things fade after a while; anomalies can get washed out.
p316
aVSo you have to keep on top of the business.
p317
aa(lp318
VCA: A lot of people look at the hedge fund industry now
p319
aVand are sort of ... shocked by it,
p320
aVby how much wealth is created there,
p321
aVand how much talent is going into it.
p322
aVDo you have any worries about that industry,
p323
aVand perhaps the financial industry in general?
p324
aVKind of being on a runaway train that's \u2014
p325
aVI don't know \u2014 helping increase inequality?
p326
aVHow would you champion what's happening in the hedge fund industry?
p327
aa(lp328
VJS: I think in the last three or four years,
p329
aVhedge funds have not done especially well.
p330
aVWe've done dandy,
p331
aVbut the hedge fund industry as a whole has not done so wonderfully.
p332
aVThe stock market has been on a roll, going up as everybody knows,
p333
aVand price-earnings ratios have grown.
p334
aVSo an awful lot of the wealth that's been created in the last \u2014
p335
aVlet's say, five or six years \u2014 has not been created by hedge funds.
p336
aVPeople would ask me, "What's a hedge fund?"
p337
aVAnd I'd say, "One and 20."
p338
aVWhich means \u2014 now it's two and 20 \u2014
p339
aVit's two percent fixed fee and 20 percent of profits.
p340
aVHedge funds are all different kinds of creatures.
p341
aa(lp342
VCA: Rumor has it you charge slightly higher fees than that.
p343
aa(lp344
VJS: We charged the highest fees in the world at one time.
p345
aVFive and 44, that's what we charge.
p346
aa(lp347
VCA: Five and 44.
p348
aVSo five percent flat, 44 percent of upside.
p349
aVYou still made your investors spectacular amounts of money.
p350
aa(lp351
VJS: We made good returns, yes.
p352
aVPeople got very mad: "How can you charge such high fees?"
p353
aVI said, "OK, you can withdraw."
p354
aVBut "How can I get more?" was what people were \u2014
p355
aa(lp356
V(Laughter)
p357
aa(lp358
VBut at a certain point, as I think I told you,
p359
aVwe bought out all the investors because there's a capacity to the fund.
p360
aa(lp361
VCA: But should we worry about the hedge fund industry
p362
aVattracting too much of the world's great mathematical and other talent
p363
aVto work on that, as opposed to the many other problems in the world?
p364
aa(lp365
VJS: Well, it's not just mathematical.
p366
aVWe hire astronomers and physicists and things like that.
p367
aVI don't think we should worry about it too much.
p368
aVIt's still a pretty small industry.
p369
aVAnd in fact, bringing science into the investing world
p370
aVhas improved that world.
p371
aVIt's reduced volatility. It's increased liquidity.
p372
aVSpreads are narrower because people are trading that kind of stuff.
p373
aVSo I'm not too worried about Einstein going off and starting a hedge fund.
p374
aa(lp375
VCA: You're at a phase in your life now where you're actually investing, though,
p376
aVat the other end of the supply chain \u2014
p377
aVyou're actually boosting mathematics across America.
p378
aVThis is your wife, Marilyn.
p379
aVYou're working on philanthropic issues together.
p380
aVTell me about that.
p381
aa(lp382
VJS: Well, Marilyn started \u2014
p383
aVthere she is up there, my beautiful wife \u2014
p384
aVshe started the foundation about 20 years ago.
p385
aVI think '94.
p386
aVI claim it was '93, she says it was '94,
p387
aVbut it was one of those two years.
p388
aa(lp389
V(Laughter)
p390
aa(lp391
VWe started the foundation, just as a convenient way to give charity.
p392
aVShe kept the books, and so on.
p393
aVWe did not have a vision at that time, but gradually a vision emerged \u2014
p394
aVwhich was to focus on math and science, to focus on basic research.
p395
aVAnd that's what we've done.
p396
aVSix years ago or so, I left Renaissance and went to work at the foundation.
p397
aVSo that's what we do.
p398
aa(lp399
VCA: And so Math for America is basically investing
p400
aVin math teachers around the country,
p401
aVgiving them some extra income, giving them support and coaching.
p402
aVAnd really trying to make that more effective
p403
aVand make that a calling to which teachers can aspire.
p404
aa(lp405
VJS: Yeah \u2014 instead of beating up the bad teachers,
p406
aVwhich has created morale problems all through the educational community,
p407
aVin particular in math and science,
p408
aVwe focus on celebrating the good ones and giving them status.
p409
aVYeah, we give them extra money, 15,000 dollars a year.
p410
aVWe have 800 math and science teachers in New York City in public schools today,
p411
aVas part of a core.
p412
aVThere's a great morale among them.
p413
aVThey're staying in the field.
p414
aVNext year, it'll be 1,000 and that'll be 10 percent
p415
aVof the math and science teachers in New York [City] public schools.
p416
aa(lp417
V(Applause)
p418
aa(lp419
VCA: Jim, here's another project that you've supported philanthropically:
p420
aVResearch into origins of life, I guess.
p421
aVWhat are we looking at here?
p422
aVJS: Well, I'll save that for a second.
p423
aVAnd then I'll tell you what you're looking at.
p424
aVOrigins of life is a fascinating question.
p425
aVHow did we get here?
p426
aVWell, there are two questions:
p427
aVOne is, what is the route from geology to biology \u2014
p428
aVhow did we get here?
p429
aVAnd the other question is, what did we start with?
p430
aVWhat material, if any, did we have to work with on this route?
p431
aVThose are two very, very interesting questions.
p432
aVThe first question is a tortuous path from geology up to RNA
p433
aVor something like that \u2014 how did that all work?
p434
aVAnd the other, what do we have to work with?
p435
aVWell, more than we think.
p436
aVSo what's pictured there is a star in formation.
p437
aVNow, every year in our Milky Way, which has 100 billion stars,
p438
aVabout two new stars are created.
p439
aVDon't ask me how, but they're created.
p440
aVAnd it takes them about a million years to settle out.
p441
aVSo, in steady state,
p442
aVthere are about two million stars in formation at any time.
p443
aVThat one is somewhere along this settling-down period.
p444
aVAnd there's all this crap sort of circling around it,
p445
aVdust and stuff.
p446
aVAnd it'll form probably a solar system, or whatever it forms.
p447
aVBut here's the thing \u2014
p448
aVin this dust that surrounds a forming star
p449
aVhave been found, now, significant organic molecules.
p450
aVMolecules not just like methane, but formaldehyde and cyanide \u2014
p451
aVthings that are the building blocks \u2014 the seeds, if you will \u2014 of life.
p452
aVSo, that may be typical.
p453
aVAnd it may be typical that planets around the universe
p454
aVstart off with some of these basic building blocks.
p455
aVNow does that mean there's going to be life all around?
p456
aVMaybe.
p457
aVBut it's a question of how tortuous this path is
p458
aVfrom those frail beginnings, those seeds, all the way to life.
p459
aVAnd most of those seeds will fall on fallow planets.
p460
aa(lp461
VCA: So for you, personally,
p462
aVfinding an answer to this question of where we came from,
p463
aVof how did this thing happen, that is something you would love to see.
p464
aa(lp465
VJS: Would love to see.
p466
aVAnd like to know \u2014
p467
aVif that path is tortuous enough, and so improbable,
p468
aVthat no matter what you start with, we could be a singularity.
p469
aVBut on the other hand,
p470
aVgiven all this organic dust that's floating around,
p471
aVwe could have lots of friends out there.
p472
aVIt'd be great to know.
p473
aa(lp474
VCA: Jim, a couple of years ago, I got the chance to speak with Elon Musk,
p475
aVand I asked him the secret of his success,
p476
aVand he said taking physics seriously was it.
p477
aVListening to you, what I hear you saying is taking math seriously,
p478
aVthat has infused your whole life.
p479
aVIt's made you an absolute fortune, and now it's allowing you to invest
p480
aVin the futures of thousands and thousands of kids across America and elsewhere.
p481
aVCould it be that science actually works?
p482
aVThat math actually works?
p483
aa(lp484
VJS: Well, math certainly works. Math certainly works.
p485
aVBut this has been fun.
p486
aVWorking with Marilyn and giving it away has been very enjoyable.
p487
aa(lp488
VCA: I just find it \u2014 it's an inspirational thought to me,
p489
aVthat by taking knowledge seriously, so much more can come from it.
p490
aVSo thank you for your amazing life, and for coming here to TED.
p491
aa(lp492
VThank you.
p493
aa(lp494
VJim Simons!

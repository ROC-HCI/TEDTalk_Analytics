VMaya Penn: I've been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon,
p29
aVand I've been making animated flip books
p30
aVsince I was three years old.
p31
aVAt that age, I also learned about what an animator was.
p32
aVThere was a program on TV about jobs
p33
aVmost kids don't know about.
p34
aVWhen I understood that an animator
p35
aVmakes the cartoons I saw on TV,
p36
aVI immediately said, "That's what I want to be."
p37
aVI don't know if I said it mentally or out loud,
p38
aVbut that was a greatly defining moment in my life.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnimation and art has always been my first love.
p41
aVIt was my love for technology that sparked the idea
p42
aVfor "Malicious Dishes."
p43
aVThere was a virus on my computer,
p44
aVand I was trying to get rid of it,
p45
aVand all of a sudden, I just thought,
p46
aVwhat if viruses have their own little world inside the computer?
p47
aVMaybe a restaurant where they meet up
p48
aVand do virusy things?
p49
aVAnd thus, "Malicious Dishes" was born.
p50
aa(lp51
VAt four years old, my dad showed me
p52
aVhow to take apart a computer and put it back together again.
p53
aVThat started my love for technology.
p54
aVI built my first website myself in HTML,
p55
aVand I'm learning JavaScript and Python.
p56
aa(lp57
VI'm also working on an animated series
p58
aVcalled "The Pollinators."
p59
aVIt's about bees and other pollinators in our environment
p60
aVand why they're so important.
p61
aVIf plants aren't pollinated by the pollinators,
p62
aVthen all creatures, including ourselves,
p63
aVthat depend on these plants, would starve.
p64
aVSo I decided to take these cool creatures
p65
aVand make a superhero team.
p66
aV(Applause)
p67
aV(Foot stomp)
p68
aV(Music)
p69
aV(Roar)
p70
aVPollinator: Deforestsaurus! I should have known!
p71
aVI need to call on the rest of the Pollinators!
p72
aV(Music)
p73
aa(lp74
VThank you. (Applause)
p75
aa(lp76
VAll of my animations start with ideas,
p77
aVbut what are ideas?
p78
aVIdeas can spark a movement.
p79
aVIdeas are opportunities and innovation.
p80
aVIdeas truly are what make the world go round.
p81
aVIf it wasn't for ideas, we wouldn't be
p82
aVwhere we are now with technology, medicine,
p83
aVart, culture, and how we even live our lives.
p84
aVAt eight years old, I took my ideas
p85
aVand started my own business called Maya's Ideas,
p86
aVand my nonprofit, Maya's Ideas for the Planet.
p87
aV(Laughter)
p88
aVAnd I make eco-friendly clothing and accessories.
p89
aVI'm 13 now, and although I started my business
p90
aVin 2008,
p91
aVmy artistic journey started way before then.
p92
aVI was greatly influenced by art, and I wanted to
p93
aVincorporate it in everything I did, even my business.
p94
aVI would find different fabrics around the house,
p95
aVand say, "This could be a scarf or a hat,"
p96
aVand I had all these ideas for designs.
p97
aVI noticed when I wore my creations,
p98
aVpeople would stop me and say,
p99
aV"Wow, that's really cute. Where can I get one?"
p100
aVAnd I thought, I can start my own business.
p101
aa(lp102
VNow I didn't have any business plans
p103
aVat only eight years old.
p104
aVI only knew I wanted to make pretty creations
p105
aVthat were safe for the environment
p106
aVand I wanted to give back.
p107
aVMy mom taught me how to sew,
p108
aVand on my back porch, I would sit and make
p109
aVlittle headbands out of ribbon,
p110
aVand I would write down the names and the price of each item.
p111
aVI started making more items like hats,
p112
aVscarves and bags.
p113
aVSoon, my items began selling all over the world,
p114
aVand I had customers in Denmark, Italy, Australia,
p115
aVCanada and more.
p116
aa(lp117
VNow, I had a lot to learn about my business,
p118
aVlike branding and marketing,
p119
aVstaying engaged with my customers,
p120
aVand seeing what sold the most and the least.
p121
aVSoon, my business really started to take off.
p122
aVThen one day, Forbes magazine  contacted me when I was 10 years old.
p123
aV(Laughter)
p124
aVThey wanted to feature me and my company
p125
aVin their article.
p126
aa(lp127
VNow a lot of people ask me,
p128
aVwhy is your business eco-friendly?
p129
aVI've had a passion for protecting the environment
p130
aVand its creatures since I was little.
p131
aVMy parents taught me at an early age
p132
aVabout giving back and being a good steward to the environment.
p133
aVI heard about how the dyes in some clothing
p134
aVor the process of even making the items
p135
aVwas harmful to the people and the planet,
p136
aVso I started doing my own research,
p137
aVand I discovered that even after dyeing has being completed,
p138
aVthere is a waste issue that gives a negative impact
p139
aVon the environment.
p140
aVFor example, the grinding of materials,
p141
aVor the dumping of dried powder materials.
p142
aVThese actions can pollute the air,
p143
aVmaking it toxic to anyone or anything that inhales it.
p144
aVSo when I started my business,
p145
aVI knew two things:
p146
aVAll of my items had to be eco-friendly,
p147
aVand 10 to 20 percent of the profits I made
p148
aVwent to local and global charities
p149
aVand environmental organizations.
p150
aV(Applause)
p151
aVI feel I'm part of the new wave of entrepreneurs
p152
aVthat not only seeks to have a successful business,
p153
aVbut also a sustainable future.
p154
aVI feel that I can meet the needs of my customers
p155
aVwithout compromising the ability of future generations
p156
aVto live in a greener tomorrow.
p157
aa(lp158
VWe live in a big, diverse and beautiful world,
p159
aVand that makes me even more passionate to save it.
p160
aVBut it's never enough to just to get it through your heads
p161
aVabout the things that are happening in our world.
p162
aVIt takes to get it through your hearts,
p163
aVbecause when you get it through your heart,
p164
aVthat is when movements are sparked.
p165
aVThat is when opportunities
p166
aVand innovation are created,
p167
aVand that is why ideas come to life.
p168
aa(lp169
VThank you, and peace and blessings.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Applause)
p172
aa(lp173
VThank you. (Applause)
p174
aa(lp175
VPat Mitchell: So, you heard Maya talk about
p176
aVthe amazing parents who are behind
p177
aVthis incredible woman. Where are they?
p178
aVPlease, Mr. and Mrs. Penn. Would you just \u2014 Ah!

VSix thousand miles of road,
p5
aV600 miles of subway track,
p6
aV400 miles of bike lanes
p7
aVand a half a mile of tram track,
p8
aVif you've ever been to Roosevelt Island.
p9
aa(lp10
VThese are the numbers that make up the infrastructure of New York City.
p11
aVThese are the statistics of our infrastructure.
p12
aVThey're the kind of numbers you can find released in reports by city agencies.
p13
aVFor example, the Department of Transportation will probably tell you
p14
aVhow many miles of road they maintain.
p15
aVThe MTA will boast how many miles of subway track there are.
p16
aVMost city agencies give us statistics.
p17
aVThis is from a report this year
p18
aVfrom the Taxi and Limousine Commission,
p19
aVwhere we learn that there's about 13,500 taxis here in New York City.
p20
aVPretty interesting, right?
p21
aVBut did you ever think about where these numbers came from?
p22
aVBecause for these numbers to exist, someone at the city agency
p23
aVhad to stop and say, hmm, here's a number that somebody might want want to know.
p24
aVHere's a number  that our citizens want to know.
p25
aVSo they go back to their raw data,
p26
aVthey count, they add, they calculate,
p27
aVand then they put out reports,
p28
aVand those reports will have numbers like this.
p29
aa(lp30
VThe problem is, how do they know all of our questions?
p31
aVWe have lots of questions.
p32
aVIn fact, in some ways there's literally an infinite number of questions
p33
aVthat we can ask about our city.
p34
aVThe agencies can never keep up.
p35
aVSo the paradigm isn't exactly working, and I think our policymakers realize that,
p36
aVbecause in 2012, Mayor Bloomberg signed into law what he called
p37
aVthe most ambitious and comprehensive open data legislation in the country.
p38
aVIn a lot of ways, he's right.
p39
aVIn the last two years,  the city has released 1,000 datasets
p40
aVon our open data portal,
p41
aVand it's pretty awesome.
p42
aVSo you go and look at data like this,
p43
aVand instead of just counting the number of cabs,
p44
aVwe can start to ask different questions.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo I had a question.
p47
aVWhen's rush hour in New York City?
p48
aVIt can be pretty bothersome. When is rush hour exactly?
p49
aVAnd I thought to myself, these cabs aren't just numbers,
p50
aVthese are GPS recorders driving around in our city streets
p51
aVrecording each and every ride they take.
p52
aVThere's data there, and I looked at that data,
p53
aVand I made a plot of the average speed of taxis in New York City throughout the day.
p54
aVYou can see that from about midnight to around 5:18 in the morning,
p55
aVspeed increases, and at that point, things turn around,
p56
aVand they get slower and slower and slower until about 8:35 in the morning,
p57
aVwhen they end up at around 11 and a half miles per hour.
p58
aVThe average taxi is going 11 and a half miles per hour on our city streets,
p59
aVand it turns out it stays that way
p60
aVfor the entire day.
p61
aV(Laughter)
p62
aVSo I said to myself, I guess there's no rush hour in New York City.
p63
aVThere's just a rush day.
p64
aVMakes sense. And this is important for a couple of reasons.
p65
aVIf you're a transportation planner, this might be pretty interesting to know.
p66
aVBut if you want to get somewhere quickly,
p67
aVyou now know to set your alarm for 4:45 in the morning and you're all set.
p68
aVNew York, right?
p69
aa(lp70
VBut there's a story behind this data.
p71
aVThis data wasn't just available, it turns out.
p72
aVIt actually came from something called a Freedom of Information Law Request,
p73
aVor a FOIL Request.
p74
aVThis is a form you can find on the Taxi and Limousine Commission website.
p75
aVIn order to access this data, you need to go get this form,
p76
aVfill it out, and they will notify you,
p77
aVand a guy named Chris Whong did exactly that.
p78
aVChris went down, and they told him,
p79
aV"Just bring a brand new hard drive  down to our office,
p80
aVleave it here for five hours, we'll copy the data and you take it back."
p81
aVAnd that's where this data came from.
p82
aVNow, Chris is the kind of guy who wants to make the data public,
p83
aVand so it ended up online for all to use, and that's where this graph came from.
p84
aVAnd the fact that it exists is amazing. These GPS recorders \u2014 really cool.
p85
aVBut the fact that we have citizens walking around with hard drives
p86
aVpicking up data from city agencies to make it public \u2014
p87
aVit was already kind of public, you could get to it,
p88
aVbut it was "public," it wasn't public.
p89
aVAnd we can do better than that as a city.
p90
aVWe don't need our citizens walking around with hard drives.
p91
aa(lp92
VNow, not every dataset is behind a FOIL Request.
p93
aVHere is a map I made with the most dangerous intersections in New York City
p94
aVbased on cyclist accidents.
p95
aVSo the red areas are more dangerous.
p96
aVAnd what it shows is first the East side of Manhattan,
p97
aVespecially in the lower area of Manhattan, has more cyclist accidents.
p98
aVThat might make sense
p99
aVbecause there are more cyclists coming off the bridges there.
p100
aVBut there's other hotspots worth studying.
p101
aVThere's Williamsburg. There's Roosevelt Avenue in Queens.
p102
aVAnd this is exactly the kind of data we need for Vision Zero.
p103
aVThis is exactly what we're looking for.
p104
aa(lp105
VBut there's a story behind this data as well.
p106
aVThis data didn't just appear.
p107
aVHow many of you guys know this logo?
p108
aVYeah, I see some shakes.
p109
aVHave you ever tried to copy and paste data out of a PDF
p110
aVand make sense of it?
p111
aVI see more shakes.
p112
aVMore of you tried copying and pasting than knew the logo. I like that.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo what happened is, the data that you just saw was actually on a PDF.
p115
aVIn fact, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages of PDF
p116
aVput out by our very own NYPD,
p117
aVand in order to access it, you would either have to copy and paste
p118
aVfor hundreds and hundreds of hours,
p119
aVor you could be John Krauss.
p120
aVJohn Krauss was like,
p121
aVI'm not going to copy and paste this data. I'm going to write a program.
p122
aVIt's called the NYPD Crash Data Band-Aid,
p123
aVand it goes to the NYPD's website and it would download PDFs.
p124
aVEvery day it would search; if it found a PDF, it would download it
p125
aVand then it would run some PDF-scraping program,
p126
aVand out would come the text,
p127
aVand it would go on the Internet, and then people could make maps like that.
p128
aVAnd the fact that the data's here, the fact that we have access to it \u2014
p129
aVEvery accident, by the way, is a row in this table.
p130
aVYou can imagine how many PDFs that is.
p131
aVThe fact that we have access to that is great,
p132
aVbut let's not release it in PDF form,
p133
aVbecause then we're having our citizens write PDF scrapers.
p134
aVIt's not the best use of our citizens' time,
p135
aVand we as a city can do better than that.
p136
aa(lp137
VNow, the good news is that the de Blasio administration
p138
aVactually recently released this data a few months ago,
p139
aVand so now we can actually have access to it,
p140
aVbut there's a lot of data still entombed in PDF.
p141
aVFor example, our crime data is still only available in PDF.
p142
aVAnd not just our crime data, our own city budget.
p143
aVOur city budget is only readable right now in PDF form.
p144
aVAnd it's not just us that can't analyze it \u2014
p145
aVour own legislators who vote for the budget
p146
aValso only get it in PDF.
p147
aVSo our legislators cannot analyze  the budget that they are voting for.
p148
aVAnd I think as a city we can do a little better than that as well.
p149
aa(lp150
VNow, there's a lot of data that's not hidden in PDFs.
p151
aVThis is an example of a map I made,
p152
aVand this is the dirtiest waterways in New York City.
p153
aVNow, how do I measure dirty?
p154
aVWell, it's kind of a little weird,
p155
aVbut I looked at the level of fecal coliform,
p156
aVwhich is a measurement of fecal matter in each of our waterways.
p157
aVThe larger the circle, the dirtier the water,
p158
aVso the large circles are dirty water, the small circles are cleaner.
p159
aVWhat you see is inland waterways.
p160
aVThis is all data that was sampled by the city over the last five years.
p161
aVAnd inland waterways are, in general, dirtier.
p162
aVThat makes sense, right?
p163
aVAnd the bigger circles are dirty. And I learned a few things from this.
p164
aVNumber one: Never swim in anything that ends in "creek" or "canal."
p165
aVBut number two: I also found the dirtiest waterway in New York City,
p166
aVby this measure, one measure.
p167
aVIn Coney Island Creek, which is not the Coney Island you swim in, luckily.
p168
aVIt's on the other side.
p169
aVBut Coney Island Creek, 94 percent of samples taken over the last five years
p170
aVhave had fecal levels so high
p171
aVthat it would be against state law to swim in the water.
p172
aa(lp173
VAnd this is not the kind of fact that you're going to see
p174
aVboasted in a city report, right?
p175
aVIt's not going to be  the front page on nyc.gov.
p176
aVYou're not going to see it there,
p177
aVbut the fact that we can get  to that data is awesome.
p178
aVBut once again, it wasn't super easy,
p179
aVbecause this data was not on the open data portal.
p180
aVIf you were to go to the open data portal,
p181
aVyou'd see just a snippet of it,  a year or a few months.
p182
aVIt was actually on the Department of Environmental Protection's website.
p183
aVAnd each one of these links is an Excel  sheet, and each Excel sheet is different.
p184
aVEvery heading is different: you copy, paste, reorganize.
p185
aVWhen you do you can make maps and that's great, but once again,
p186
aVwe can do better than that  as a city, we can normalize things.
p187
aa(lp188
VAnd we're getting there, because there's this website that Socrata makes
p189
aVcalled the Open Data Portal NYC.
p190
aVThis is where 1,100 data sets  that don't suffer
p191
aVfrom the things I just told you live,
p192
aVand that number is growing, and that's great.
p193
aVYou can download data in any format, be it CSV or PDF or Excel document.
p194
aVWhatever you want, you can download the data that way.
p195
aVThe problem is, once you do,
p196
aVyou will find that each agency codes their addresses differently.
p197
aVSo one is street name,  intersection street,
p198
aVstreet, borough, address, building, building address.
p199
aVSo once again, you're spending time, even when we have this portal,
p200
aVyou're spending time normalizing our address fields.
p201
aVAnd that's not the best use  of our citizens' time.
p202
aVWe can do better than that as a city.
p203
aVWe can standardize our addresses,
p204
aVand if we do,  we can get more maps like this.
p205
aa(lp206
VThis is a map of fire hydrants in New York City,
p207
aVbut not just any fire hydrants.
p208
aVThese are the top 250 grossing fire hydrants in terms of parking tickets.
p209
aV(Laughter)
p210
aVSo I learned a few things from this map, and I really like this map.
p211
aVNumber one, just don't park on the Upper East Side.
p212
aVJust don't. It doesn't matter where you park, you will get a hydrant ticket.
p213
aVNumber two, I found the two highest grossing hydrants in all of New York City,
p214
aVand they're on the Lower East Side,
p215
aVand they were bringing in over 55,000 dollars a year in parking tickets.
p216
aVAnd that seemed a little strange to me when I noticed it,
p217
aVso I did a little digging and it turns out what you had is a hydrant
p218
aVand then something called a curb extension,
p219
aVwhich is like a seven-foot space to walk on,
p220
aVand then a parking spot.
p221
aVAnd so these cars came along, and the hydrant \u2014
p222
aV"It's all the way over there, I'm fine,"
p223
aVand there was actually a parking spot painted there beautifully for them.
p224
aVThey would park there, and the NYPD disagreed with this designation
p225
aVand would ticket them.
p226
aVAnd it wasn't just me  who found a parking ticket.
p227
aVThis is the Google  Street View car driving by
p228
aVfinding the same parking ticket.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo I wrote about this on my blog, on I Quant NY, and the DOT responded,
p231
aVand they said,
p232
aV"While the DOT has not received any complaints about this location,
p233
aVwe will review the roadway markings and make any appropriate alterations."
p234
aVAnd I thought to myself, typical government response,
p235
aVall right, moved on with my life.
p236
aa(lp237
VBut then, a few weeks later, something incredible happened.
p238
aVThey repainted the spot,
p239
aVand for a second I thought I saw the future of open data,
p240
aVbecause think about what happened here.
p241
aVFor five years, this spot was being  ticketed, and it was confusing,
p242
aVand then a citizen found something, they told the city, and within a few weeks
p243
aVthe problem was fixed.
p244
aVIt's amazing. And a lot of people see open data as being a watchdog.
p245
aVIt's not, it's about being a partner.
p246
aVWe can empower our citizens to be better partners for government,
p247
aVand it's not that hard.
p248
aVAll we need are a few changes.
p249
aVIf you're FOILing data,
p250
aVif you're seeing your data  being FOILed over and over again,
p251
aVlet's release it to the public, that's a sign that it should be made public.
p252
aVAnd if you're a government agency releasing a PDF,
p253
aVlet's pass legislation that requires you to post it with the underlying data,
p254
aVbecause that data is coming from somewhere.
p255
aVI don't know where, but it's coming from somewhere,
p256
aVand you can release it with the PDF.
p257
aVAnd let's adopt and share some open data standards.
p258
aVLet's start with our addresses here in New York City.
p259
aVLet's just start normalizing our addresses.
p260
aVBecause New York is a leader in open data.
p261
aVDespite all this, we are absolutely a leader in open data,
p262
aVand if we start normalizing things, and set an open data standard,
p263
aVothers will follow. The state will follow, and maybe the federal government,
p264
aVOther countries could follow,
p265
aVand we're not that far off from a time where you could write one program
p266
aVand map information from 100 countries.
p267
aVIt's not science fiction. We're actually quite close.
p268
aa(lp269
VAnd by the way, who are we empowering with this?
p270
aVBecause it's not just John Krauss and it's not just Chris Whong.
p271
aVThere are hundreds of meetups going on in New York City right now,
p272
aVactive meetups.
p273
aVThere are thousands of people attending these meetups.
p274
aVThese people are going after work and on weekends,
p275
aVand they're attending these meetups to look at open data
p276
aVand make our city a better place.
p277
aVGroups like BetaNYC, who just last week  released something called citygram.nyc
p278
aVthat allows you to subscribe to 311 complaints
p279
aVaround your own home, or around your office.
p280
aVYou put in your address, you get local complaints.
p281
aVAnd it's not just the tech community that are after these things.
p282
aVIt's urban planners like  the students I teach at Pratt.
p283
aVIt's policy advocates, it's everyone,
p284
aVit's citizens from a diverse set of backgrounds.
p285
aVAnd with some small, incremental changes,
p286
aVwe can unlock the passion and the ability of our citizens
p287
aVto harness open data and make our city even better,
p288
aVwhether it's one dataset, or one parking spot at a time.
p289
aa(lp290
VThank you.

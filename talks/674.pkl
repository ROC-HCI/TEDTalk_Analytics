VA human child is born,
p5
aVand for quite a long time
p6
aVis a consumer.
p7
aVIt cannot be consciously a contributor.
p8
aVIt is helpless.
p9
aVIt doesn't know how to survive,
p10
aVeven though it is endowed with an instinct to survive.
p11
aVIt needs the help of mother, or a foster mother, to survive.
p12
aVIt can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child.
p13
aVIt has to totally surrender,
p14
aVas one surrenders to an anesthesiologist.
p15
aa(lp16
VIt has to totally surrender.
p17
aVThat implies a lot of trust.
p18
aVThat implies the trusted person
p19
aVwon't violate the trust.
p20
aVAs the child grows,
p21
aVit begins to discover
p22
aVthat the person trusted is violating the trust.
p23
aVIt doesn't know even the word "violation."
p24
aVTherefore, it has to blame itself,
p25
aVa wordless blame,
p26
aVwhich is more difficult to really resolve \u2014
p27
aVthe wordless self-blame.
p28
aa(lp29
VAs the child grows to become an adult:
p30
aVso far, it has been a consumer,
p31
aVbut the growth of a human being
p32
aVlies in his or her capacity to contribute,
p33
aVto be a contributor.
p34
aVOne cannot contribute unless one feels secure,
p35
aVone feels big,
p36
aVone feels: I have enough.
p37
aa(lp38
VTo be compassionate is not a joke.
p39
aVIt's not that simple.
p40
aVOne has to discover a certain bigness in oneself.
p41
aVThat bigness should be centered on oneself,
p42
aVnot in terms of money,
p43
aVnot in terms of power you wield,
p44
aVnot in terms of any status that you can command in the society,
p45
aVbut it should be centered on oneself.
p46
aVThe self: you are self-aware.
p47
aVOn that self, it should be centered \u2014 a bigness, a wholeness.
p48
aVOtherwise, compassion is just a word and a dream.
p49
aa(lp50
VYou can be compassionate occasionally,
p51
aVmore moved by empathy
p52
aVthan by compassion.
p53
aVThank God we are empathetic.
p54
aVWhen somebody's in pain, we pick up the pain.
p55
aa(lp56
VIn a Wimbledon final match,
p57
aVthese two guys fight it out.
p58
aVEach one has got two games.
p59
aVIt can be anybody's game.
p60
aVWhat they have sweated so far has no meaning.
p61
aVOne person wins.
p62
aVThe tennis etiquette is, both the players have to come to the net
p63
aVand shake hands.
p64
aVThe winner boxes the air
p65
aVand kisses the ground,
p66
aVthrows his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it.
p67
aV(Laughter)
p68
aVAnd this guy has to come to the net.
p69
aVWhen he comes to the net,
p70
aVyou see, his whole face changes.
p71
aVIt looks as though he's wishing that he didn't win.
p72
aVWhy? Empathy.
p73
aa(lp74
VThat's human heart.
p75
aVNo human heart is denied of that empathy.
p76
aVNo religion can demolish that by indoctrination.
p77
aVNo culture, no nation and nationalism \u2014
p78
aVnothing can touch it
p79
aVbecause it is empathy.
p80
aVAnd that capacity to empathize
p81
aVis the window through which you reach out to people,
p82
aVyou do something that makes a difference in somebody's life \u2014
p83
aVeven words, even time.
p84
aa(lp85
VCompassion is not defined in one form.
p86
aVThere's no Indian compassion.
p87
aVThere's no American compassion.
p88
aVIt transcends nation, the gender, the age.
p89
aVWhy? Because it is there in everybody.
p90
aVIt's experienced by people occasionally.
p91
aa(lp92
VThen this occasional compassion,
p93
aVwe are not talking about \u2014
p94
aVit will never remain occasional.
p95
aVBy mandate, you cannot make a person compassionate.
p96
aVYou can't say, "Please love me."
p97
aVLove is something you discover.
p98
aVIt's not an action,
p99
aVbut in the English language, it is also an action.
p100
aVI will come to it later.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo one has got to discover a certain wholeness.
p103
aVI am going to cite the possibility of being whole,
p104
aVwhich is within our experience, everybody's experience.
p105
aVIn spite of a very tragic life,
p106
aVone is happy in moments which are very few and far between.
p107
aVAnd the one who is happy,
p108
aVeven for a slapstick joke,
p109
aVaccepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself.
p110
aa(lp111
VThat means the whole universe,
p112
aVknown things and unknown things.
p113
aVAll of them are totally accepted
p114
aVbecause you discover your wholeness in yourself.
p115
aVThe subject \u2014 "me" \u2014
p116
aVand the object \u2014 the scheme of things \u2014
p117
aVfuse into oneness,
p118
aVan experience nobody can say, "I am denied of,"
p119
aVan experience common to all and sundry.
p120
aa(lp121
VThat experience confirms that, in spite of all your limitations \u2014
p122
aVall your wants, desires, unfulfilled, and the credit cards
p123
aVand layoffs
p124
aVand, finally, baldness \u2014
p125
aVyou can be happy.
p126
aVBut the extension of the logic is
p127
aVthat you don't need to fulfill your desire to be happy.
p128
aVYou are the very happiness, the wholeness that you want to be.
p129
aa(lp130
VThere's no choice in this:
p131
aVthat only confirms the reality
p132
aVthat the wholeness cannot be different from you,
p133
aVcannot be minus you.
p134
aVIt has got to be you.
p135
aVYou cannot be a part of wholeness
p136
aVand still be whole.
p137
aVYour moment of happiness reveals that reality,
p138
aVthat realization, that recognition:
p139
aV"Maybe I am the whole.
p140
aVMaybe the swami is right.
p141
aa(lp142
VMaybe the swami is right." You start your new life.
p143
aVThen everything becomes meaningful.
p144
aVI have no more reason to blame myself.
p145
aVIf one has to blame oneself, one has a million reasons plus many.
p146
aVBut if I say, in spite of my body being limited \u2014
p147
aVif it is black it is not white, if it is white it is not black:
p148
aVbody is limited any which way you look at it. Limited.
p149
aa(lp150
VYour knowledge is limited, health is limited,
p151
aVand power is therefore limited,
p152
aVand the cheerfulness is going to be limited.
p153
aVCompassion is going to be limited.
p154
aVEverything is going to be limitless.
p155
aVYou cannot command compassion
p156
aVunless you become limitless, and nobody can become limitless,
p157
aVeither you are or you are not. Period.
p158
aVAnd there is no way of your being not limitless too.
p159
aa(lp160
VYour own experience reveals, in spite of all limitations, you are the whole.
p161
aVAnd the wholeness is the reality of you
p162
aVwhen you relate to the world.
p163
aVIt is love first.
p164
aVWhen you relate to the world,
p165
aVthe dynamic manifestation of the wholeness
p166
aVis, what we say, love.
p167
aVAnd itself becomes compassion
p168
aVif the object that you relate to evokes that emotion.
p169
aVThen that again transforms into giving, into sharing.
p170
aVYou express yourself because you have compassion.
p171
aa(lp172
VTo discover compassion, you need to be compassionate.
p173
aVTo discover the capacity to give and share,
p174
aVyou need to be giving and sharing.
p175
aVThere is no shortcut: it is like swimming by swimming.
p176
aVYou learn swimming by swimming.
p177
aVYou cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water.
p178
aV(Laughter)
p179
aVYou learn swimming by swimming. You learn cycling by cycling.
p180
aVYou learn cooking by cooking,
p181
aVhaving some sympathetic people around you
p182
aVto eat what you cook.
p183
aV(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VAnd, therefore, what I say,
p186
aVyou have to fake it and make it.
p187
aV(Laughter)
p188
aVYou need to.
p189
aVMy predecessor meant that.
p190
aVYou have to act it out.
p191
aVYou have to act compassionately.
p192
aa(lp193
VThere is no verb for compassion,
p194
aVbut you have an adverb for compassion.
p195
aVThat's interesting to me.
p196
aVYou act compassionately.
p197
aVBut then, how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion?
p198
aVThat is where you fake.
p199
aVYou fake it and make it. This is the mantra of the United States of America.
p200
aV(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
VYou fake it and make it.
p203
aVYou act compassionately as though you have compassion:
p204
aVgrind your teeth,
p205
aVtake all the support system.
p206
aVIf you know how to pray, pray.
p207
aVAsk for compassion.
p208
aVLet me act compassionately.
p209
aVDo it.
p210
aVYou'll discover compassion
p211
aVand also slowly a relative compassion,
p212
aVand slowly, perhaps if you get the right teaching,
p213
aVyou'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation
p214
aVof the reality of yourself, which is oneness, wholeness,
p215
aVand that's what you are.
p216
aa(lp217
VWith these words, thank you very much.
p218
aV(Applause)

Within the Hindu community, he has worked to create harmony, founding the <a href=\\"http://www.acharyasabha.org/\\">Hindu Dharma Acharya Sabha</a>, where heads of different sects can come together learn from each other. In the larger religious community, he has also made huge strides towards cooperation, convening the first <a href=\\"http://www.infinityfoundation.com/mandala/s_ot/s_ot_world_congress.htm\\">World Congress for the Preservation of Religious Diversity</a>. <br /><br />However, Swami Saraswati&rsquo;s work is not limited to the religious community. <strong>He is the founder and an active executive member of the <a href=\\"http://www.aimforseva.org/\\">All India Movement (AIM) for Seva</a></strong>. Since 2000, AIM has been bringing medical assistance, education, food and infrastructure to people living in the most remote areas of India.

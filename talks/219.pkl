VSo, what I'd like to talk about is something
p5
aVthat was very dear to Kahn's heart, which is:
p6
aVhow do we discover what is really particular about a project?
p7
aVHow do you discover the uniqueness of a project as unique as a person?
p8
aVBecause it seems to me that finding this uniqueness
p9
aVhas to do with dealing with the whole force of globalization;
p10
aVthat the particular is central to finding the uniqueness of place
p11
aVand the uniqueness of a program in a building.
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd so I'll take you to Wichita, Kansas,
p14
aVwhere I was asked some years ago to do a science museum
p15
aVon a site, right downtown by the river.
p16
aVAnd I thought the secret of the site was to make the building of the river, part of the river.
p17
aVUnfortunately, though, the site was separated from the river by McLean Boulevard
p18
aVso I suggested, "Let's reroute McLean,"
p19
aVand that gave birth instantly to Friends of McLean Boulevard.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aVAnd it took six months to reroute it.
p22
aa(lp23
VThe first image I showed the building committee was
p24
aVthis astronomic observatory of Jantar Mantar in Jaipur
p25
aVbecause I talked about what makes a building a building of science.
p26
aVAnd it seemed to me that this structure \u2014 complex, rich and yet
p27
aVtotally rational: it's an instrument \u2014 had something to do with science,
p28
aVand somehow a building for science should be different and unique and speak of that.
p29
aVAnd so my first sketch after I left was to say,
p30
aV"Let's cut the channel and make an island and make an island building."
p31
aVAnd I got all excited and came back, and
p32
aVthey sort of looked at me in dismay and said, "An island?
p33
aVThis used to be an island \u2014 Ackerman Island \u2014
p34
aVand we filled in the channel during the Depression to create jobs."
p35
aV(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd so the process began and they said,
p38
aV"You can't put it all on an island;
p39
aVsome of it has to be on the mainland because
p40
aVwe don't want to turn our back to the community."
p41
aVAnd there emerged a design: the galleries sort of forming an island
p42
aVand you could walk through them or on the roof.
p43
aVAnd there were all kinds of exciting features:
p44
aVyou could come in through the landside buildings,
p45
aVwalk through the galleries into playgrounds in the landscape.
p46
aVIf you were cheap you could walk on top of a bridge to the roof,
p47
aVpeek in the exhibits and then get totally seduced,
p48
aVcome back and pay the five dollars admission.
p49
aV(Laughter)
p50
aVAnd the client was happy \u2014 well, sort of happy
p51
aVbecause we were four million dollars over the budget, but essentially happy.
p52
aa(lp53
VBut I was still troubled, and I was troubled because I felt this was capricious.
p54
aVIt was complex, but there was something capricious about its complexity.
p55
aVIt was, what I would say, compositional complexity,
p56
aVand I felt that if I had to fulfill what I talked about \u2014
p57
aVa building for science \u2014 there had to be some kind of a generating idea,
p58
aVsome kind of a generating geometry.
p59
aVAnd this gave birth to the idea of having toroidal generating geometry,
p60
aVone with its center deep in the earth for the landside building
p61
aVand a toroid with its center in the sky for the island building.
p62
aVA toroid, for those who don't know,
p63
aVis the surface of a doughnut or, for some of us, a bagel.
p64
aVAnd out of this idea started spinning off many,
p65
aVmany kinds of variations of different plans and possibilities,
p66
aVand then the plan itself evolved in relationship to the exhibits,
p67
aVand you see the intersection of the plan with the toroidal geometry.
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd finally the building \u2014 this is the model.
p70
aVAnd when there were complaints about budget, I said,
p71
aV"Well, it's worth doing the island because you get twice for your money: reflections."
p72
aVAnd here's the building as it opened,
p73
aVwith a channel overlooking downtown, and as seen from downtown.
p74
aVAnd the bike route's going right through the building,
p75
aVso those traveling the river would see the exhibits and be drawn to the building.
p76
aVThe toroidal geometry made for a very efficient building:
p77
aVevery beam in this building is the same radius, all laminated wood.
p78
aVEvery wall, every concrete wall is resisting the stresses and supporting the building.
p79
aVEvery piece of the building works.
p80
aVThese are the galleries with the light coming in through the skylights,
p81
aVand at night, and on opening day.
p82
aa(lp83
VGoing back to 1976.
p84
aV(Applause)
p85
aVIn 1976, I was asked to design a children's memorial museum
p86
aVin a Holocaust museum in Yad Vashem in Jerusalem,
p87
aVwhich you see here the campus.
p88
aVI was asked to do a building,
p89
aVand I was given all the artifacts of clothing and drawings.
p90
aVAnd I felt very troubled.
p91
aVI worked on it for months and I couldn't deal with it
p92
aVbecause I felt people were coming out of the historic museum,
p93
aVthey are totally saturated with information
p94
aVand to see yet another museum with information,
p95
aVit would make them just unable to digest.
p96
aVAnd so I made a counter-proposal:
p97
aa(lp98
VI said, "No building." There was a cave on the site; we tunnel into the hill,
p99
aVdescend through the rock into an underground chamber.
p100
aVThere's an anteroom with photographs of children who perished
p101
aVand then you come into a large space.
p102
aVThere is a single candle flickering in the center;
p103
aVby an arrangement of reflective glasses, it reflects into infinity in all directions.
p104
aVYou walk through the space, a voice reads the names,
p105
aVages and place of birth of the children.
p106
aVThis voice does not repeat for six months.
p107
aVAnd then you descend to light and to the north and to life.
p108
aa(lp109
VWell, they said, "People won't understand,
p110
aVthey'll think it's a discotheque. You can't do that."
p111
aVAnd they shelved the project. And it sat there for 10 years,
p112
aVand then one day Abe Spiegel from Los Angeles,
p113
aVwho had lost his three-year-old son at Auschwitz,
p114
aVcame, saw the model, wrote the check and it got built 10 years later.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo, many years after that in 1998,
p117
aVI was on one of my monthly trips to Jerusalem
p118
aVand I got a call from the foreign ministry saying,
p119
aV"We've got the Chief Minister of the Punjab here.
p120
aVHe is on a state visit. We took him on a visit to Yad Vashem,
p121
aVwe took him to the children's memorial; he was extremely moved.
p122
aVHe's demanding to meet the architect. Could you come down and meet him in Tel Aviv?"
p123
aVAnd I went down and Chief Minister Badal said to me,
p124
aV"We Sikhs have suffered a great deal, as you have Jews.
p125
aVI was very moved by what I saw today.
p126
aVWe are going to build our national museum to tell the story of our people;
p127
aVwe're about to embark on that.
p128
aVI'd like you to come and design it."
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd so, you know, it's one of those things that you don't take too seriously.
p131
aVBut two weeks later, I was in this little town, Anandpur Sahib,
p132
aVoutside Chandigarh, the capital of the Punjab,
p133
aVand the temple and also next to it the fortress
p134
aVthat the last guru of the Sikhs, Guru Gobind, died in
p135
aVas he wrote the Khalsa, which is their holy scripture.
p136
aVAnd I got to work and they took me somewhere down there,
p137
aVnine kilometers away from the town and the temple,
p138
aVand said, "That's where we have chosen the location."
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd I said, "This just doesn't make any sense.
p141
aVThe pilgrims come here by the hundreds of thousands \u2014
p142
aVthey're not going to get in trucks and buses and go down there.
p143
aVLet's get back to the town and walk to the site."
p144
aVAnd I recommended they do it right there, on that hill
p145
aVand this hill, and bridge all the way into the town.
p146
aVAnd, as things are a little easier in India, the site was purchased within a week
p147
aVand we were working.
p148
aV(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd my proposal was to split the museum into two \u2014
p151
aVthe permanent exhibits at one end, the auditorium, library,
p152
aVand changing exhibitions on the other \u2014
p153
aVto flood the valley into a series of water gardens
p154
aVand to link it all to the fort and to the downtown.
p155
aVAnd the structures rise from the sand cliffs \u2014
p156
aVthey're built in concrete and sandstones; the roofs are stainless steel \u2014
p157
aVthey are facing south and reflecting light towards the temple itself,
p158
aVpedestrians crisscross from one side to the other.
p159
aVAnd as you come from the north, it is all masonry growing out of the sand cliffs
p160
aVas you come from the Himalayas and evoking the tradition of the fortress.
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd then I went away for four months
p163
aVand there was going to be groundbreaking.
p164
aVAnd I came back and, lo and behold, the little model I'd left behind
p165
aVhad been built ten times bigger for public display on site
p166
aVand ... the bridge was built!
p167
aV(Laughter)
p168
aVWithin the working drawings!
p169
aVAnd half a million people gathered for the celebrations;
p170
aVyou can see them on the site itself as the foundations are beginning.
p171
aVI was renamed Safdie Singh. And there it is under construction;
p172
aVthere are 1,800 workers at work and it will be finished in two years.
p173
aa(lp174
VBack to Yad Vashem three years ago. After all this episode began,
p175
aVYad Vashem decided to rebuild completely the historic museum
p176
aVbecause now Washington was built \u2014 the Holocaust Museum in Washington \u2014
p177
aVand that museum is so much more comprehensive in terms of information.
p178
aVAnd Yad Vashem needs to deal with three million visitors a year at this point.
p179
aVThey said, "Let's rebuild the museum."
p180
aVBut of course, the Sikhs might give you a job on a platter \u2014 the Jews make it hard:
p181
aVinternational competition, phase one, phase two, phase three.
p182
aV(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd again, I felt kind of uncomfortable with the notion
p185
aVthat a building the size of the Washington building \u2014
p186
aV50,000 square feet \u2014 will sit on that fragile hill
p187
aVand that we will go into galleries \u2014 rooms with doors
p188
aVand sort of familiar rooms \u2014 to tell the story of the Holocaust.
p189
aVAnd I proposed that we cut through the mountain. That was my first sketch.
p190
aVJust cut the whole museum through the mountain \u2014
p191
aVenter from one side of the mountain,
p192
aVcome out on the other side of the mountain \u2014
p193
aVand then bring light through the mountain into the chambers.
p194
aa(lp195
VAnd here you see the model:
p196
aVa reception building and some underground parking.
p197
aVYou cross a bridge, you enter this triangular room, 60 feet high,
p198
aVwhich cuts right into the hill
p199
aVand extends right through as you go towards the north.
p200
aVAnd all of it, then, all the galleries are underground,
p201
aVand you see the openings for the light.
p202
aVAnd at night, just one line of light cuts through the mountain,
p203
aVwhich is a skylight on top of that triangle.
p204
aVAnd all the galleries,
p205
aVas you move through them and so on, are below grade.
p206
aVAnd there are chambers carved in the rock \u2014
p207
aVconcrete walls, stone, the natural rock when possible \u2014 with the light shafts.
p208
aVThis is actually a Spanish quarry, which sort of inspired
p209
aVthe kind of spaces that these galleries could be.
p210
aVAnd then, coming towards the north, it opens up:
p211
aVit bursts out of the mountain into, again, a view of light and of the city
p212
aVand of the Jerusalem hills.
p213
aa(lp214
VI'd like to conclude with a project I've been working on for two months.
p215
aVIt's the headquarters for the Institute of Peace in Washington,
p216
aVthe U.S. Institute of Peace.
p217
aVThe site chosen is across from the Lincoln Memorial;
p218
aVyou see it there directly on the Mall. It's the last building on the Mall,
p219
aVon access of the Roosevelt Bridge that comes in from Virginia.
p220
aVThat too was a competition, and it is something I'm just beginning to work on.
p221
aa(lp222
VBut one recognized the kind of uniqueness of the site.
p223
aVIf it were to be anywhere in Washington,
p224
aVit would be an office building, a conference center,
p225
aVa place for negotiating peace and so on \u2014 all of which the building is \u2014
p226
aVbut by virtue of the choice of putting it on the Mall and by the Lincoln Memorial,
p227
aVthis becomes the structure that is the symbol of peace on the Mall.
p228
aVAnd that was a lot of heat to deal with.
p229
aa(lp230
VThe first sketch recognizes that the building is many spaces \u2014
p231
aVspaces where research goes on, conference centers,
p232
aVa public building because it will be a museum devoted to peacemaking \u2014
p233
aVand these are the drawings that we submitted for the competition,
p234
aVthe plans showing the spaces which radiate outwards from the entry.
p235
aVYou see the structure as, in the sequence of structures on the Mall,
p236
aVvery transparent and inviting and looking in.
p237
aVAnd then as you enter it again, looking in all directions towards the city.
p238
aVAnd what I felt about that building is that it really was a building
p239
aVthat had to do with a lightness of being \u2014 to quote Kundera \u2014
p240
aVthat it had to do with whiteness,
p241
aVit had to do with a certain dynamic quality and it had to do with optimism.
p242
aVAnd this is where it is; it's sort of evolving.
p243
aa(lp244
VStudies for the structure of the roof,
p245
aVwhich demands maybe new materials:
p246
aVhow to make it white, how to make it translucent, how to make it glowing,
p247
aVhow to make it not capricious.
p248
aVAnd here studying, in three dimensions,
p249
aVhow to give some kind, again, of order, a structure;
p250
aVnot something you feel you could just change
p251
aVbecause you stop the design of that particular process.
p252
aVAnd so it goes.
p253
aa(lp254
VI'd like to conclude by saying something ...
p255
aV(Applause)
p256
aVI'd like to conclude by relating all of what I've said to the term "beauty."
p257
aVAnd I know it is not a fashionable term these days,
p258
aVand certainly not fashionable in the discourse of architectural schools,
p259
aVbut it seems to me that all this, in one way or the other, is a search for beauty.
p260
aVBeauty in the most profound sense of fit.
p261
aVI have a quote that I like by a morphologist, 1917,
p262
aVTheodore Cook, who said, "Beauty connotes humanity.
p263
aVWe call a natural object beautiful because we see
p264
aVthat its form expresses fitness, the perfect fulfillment of function."
p265
aVWell, I would have said the perfect fulfillment of purpose.
p266
aVNevertheless, beauty as the kind of fit; something that tells us
p267
aVthat all the forces that have to do with our natural environment
p268
aVhave been fulfilled \u2014 and our human environment \u2014 for that.
p269
aa(lp270
VTwenty years ago, in a conference Richard and I were at together,
p271
aVI wrote a poem, which seems to me to still hold for me today.
p272
aV"He who seeks truth shall find beauty. He who seeks beauty shall find vanity.
p273
aVHe who seeks order shall find gratification.
p274
aVHe who seeks gratification shall be disappointed.
p275
aVHe who considers himself the servant of his fellow beings
p276
aVshall find the joy of self-expression. He who seeks self-expression
p277
aVshall fall into the pit of arrogance.
p278
aVArrogance is incompatible with nature.
p279
aVThrough nature, the nature of the universe and the nature of man,
p280
aVwe shall seek truth. If we seek truth, we shall find beauty."
p281
aa(lp282
VThank you very much. (Applause)

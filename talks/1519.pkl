VAs an architect, I often ask myself,
p5
aVwhat is the origin of the forms that we design?
p6
aVWhat kind of forms could we design
p7
aVif we wouldn't work with references anymore?
p8
aVIf we had no bias, if we had no preconceptions,
p9
aVwhat kind of forms could we design
p10
aVif we could free ourselves from
p11
aVour experience?
p12
aVIf we could free ourselves from our education?
p13
aVWhat would these unseen forms look like?
p14
aVWould they surprise us? Would they intrigue us?
p15
aVWould they delight us?
p16
aVIf so, then how can we go about creating something that is truly new?
p17
aa(lp18
VI propose we look to nature.
p19
aVNature has been called the greatest architect of forms.
p20
aVAnd I'm not saying that we should copy nature,
p21
aVI'm not saying we should mimic biology,
p22
aVinstead I propose that we can borrow nature's processes.
p23
aVWe can abstract them and to create something that is new.
p24
aVNature's main process of creation, morphogenesis,
p25
aVis the splitting of one cell into two cells.
p26
aVAnd these cells can either be identical,
p27
aVor they can be distinct from each other
p28
aVthrough asymmetric cell division.
p29
aa(lp30
VIf we abstract this process, and simplify it as much as possible,
p31
aVthen we could start with a single sheet of paper,
p32
aVone surface, and we could make a fold
p33
aVand divide the surface into two surfaces.
p34
aVWe're free to choose where we make the fold.
p35
aVAnd by doing so, we can differentiate the surfaces.
p36
aVThrough this very simple process,
p37
aVwe can create an astounding variety of forms.
p38
aa(lp39
VNow, we can take this form and use the same process
p40
aVto generate three-dimensional structures,
p41
aVbut rather than folding things by hand,
p42
aVwe'll bring the structure into the computer,
p43
aVand code it as an algorithm.
p44
aVAnd in doing so, we can suddenly fold anything.
p45
aVWe can fold a million times faster,
p46
aVwe can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations.
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd as we're seeking to make something three-dimensional,
p49
aVwe start not with a single surface, but with a volume.
p50
aVA simple volume, the cube.
p51
aVIf we take its surfaces and fold them
p52
aVagain and again and again and again,
p53
aVthen after 16 iterations, 16 steps,
p54
aVwe end up with 400,000 surfaces and a shape that looks,
p55
aVfor instance, like this.
p56
aVAnd if we change where we make the folds,
p57
aVif we change the folding ratio,
p58
aVthen this cube turns into this one.
p59
aVWe can change the folding ratio again to produce this shape,
p60
aVor this shape.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo we exert control over the form
p63
aVby specifying the position of where we're making the fold,
p64
aVbut essentially you're looking at a folded cube.
p65
aVAnd we can play with this.
p66
aVWe can apply different folding ratios to different parts
p67
aVof the form to create local conditions.
p68
aVWe can begin to sculpt the form.
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd because we're doing the folding on the computer,
p71
aVwe are completely free of any physical constraints.
p72
aVSo that means that surfaces can intersect themselves,
p73
aVthey can become impossibly small.
p74
aVWe can make folds that we otherwise could not make.
p75
aVSurfaces can become porous.
p76
aVThey can stretch. They can tear.
p77
aVAnd all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce.
p78
aa(lp79
VBut in each case, I didn't design the form.
p80
aVI designed the process that generated the form.
p81
aVIn general, if we make a small change to the folding ratio,
p82
aVwhich is what you're seeing here,
p83
aVthen the form changes correspondingly.
p84
aa(lp85
VBut that's only half of the story \u2014
p86
aV99.9 percent of the folding ratios produce not this,
p87
aVbut this, the geometric equivalent of noise.
p88
aVThe forms that I showed before were made actually
p89
aVthrough very long trial and error.
p90
aVA far more effective way to create forms, I have found,
p91
aVis to use information that is already contained in forms.
p92
aVA very simple form such as this one actually contains
p93
aVa lot of information that may not be visible to the human eye.
p94
aVSo, for instance, we can plot the length of the edges.
p95
aVWhite surfaces have long edges, black ones have short ones.
p96
aVWe can plot the planarity of the surfaces, their curvature,
p97
aVhow radial they are \u2014 all information that may not be
p98
aVinstantly visible to you,
p99
aVbut that we can bring out, that we can articulate,
p100
aVand that we can use to control the folding.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo now I'm not specifying a single
p103
aVratio anymore to fold it,
p104
aVbut instead I'm establishing a rule,
p105
aVI'm establishing a link between a property of a surface
p106
aVand how that surface is folded.
p107
aVAnd because I've designed the process and not the form,
p108
aVI can run the process again and again and again
p109
aVto produce a whole family of forms.
p110
aa(lp111
VThese forms look elaborate, but the process is a very minimal one.
p112
aVThere is a simple input,
p113
aVit's always a cube that I start with,
p114
aVand it's a very simple operation \u2014 it's making a fold,
p115
aVand doing this over and over again.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo let's bring this process to architecture.
p118
aVHow? And at what scale?
p119
aVI chose to design a column.
p120
aVColumns are architectural archetypes.
p121
aVThey've been used throughout history to express ideals
p122
aVabout beauty, about technology.
p123
aVA challenge to me was how we could express
p124
aVthis new algorithmic order in a column.
p125
aVI started using four cylinders.
p126
aVThrough a lot of experimentation, these cylinders
p127
aVeventually evolved into this.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd these columns, they have information at very many scales.
p130
aVWe can begin to zoom into them.
p131
aVThe closer one gets, the more new features one discovers.
p132
aVSome formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility.
p133
aVAnd unlike traditional architecture,
p134
aVit's a single process that creates both the overall form
p135
aVand the microscopic surface detail.
p136
aVThese forms are undrawable.
p137
aVAn architect who's drawing them with a pen and a paper
p138
aVwould probably take months,
p139
aVor it would take even a year to draw all the sections,
p140
aVall of the elevations, you can only create something like this
p141
aVthrough an algorithm.
p142
aa(lp143
VThe more interesting question, perhaps, is,
p144
aVare these forms imaginable?
p145
aVUsually, an architect can somehow envision the end state
p146
aVof what he is designing.
p147
aVIn this case, the process is deterministic.
p148
aVThere's no randomness involved at all,
p149
aVbut it's not entirely predictable.
p150
aVThere's too many surfaces,
p151
aVthere's too much detail, one can't see the end state.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo this leads to a new role for the architect.
p154
aVOne needs a new method to explore all of the possibilities
p155
aVthat are out there.
p156
aVFor one thing, one can design many variants of a form,
p157
aVin parallel, and one can cultivate them.
p158
aVAnd to go back to the analogy with nature,
p159
aVone can begin to think in terms of populations,
p160
aVone can talk about permutations, about generations,
p161
aVabout crossing and breeding to come up with a design.
p162
aVAnd the architect is really, he moves into the position
p163
aVof being an orchestrator of all of these processes.
p164
aa(lp165
VBut enough of the theory.
p166
aVAt one point I simply wanted to jump inside
p167
aVthis image, so to say, I bought these red and blue
p168
aV3D glasses, got up very close to the screen,
p169
aVbut still that wasn't the same as being able to
p170
aVwalk around and touch things.
p171
aVSo there was only one possibility \u2014
p172
aVto bring the column out of the computer.
p173
aa(lp174
VThere's been a lot of talk now about 3D printing.
p175
aVFor me, or for my purpose at this moment,
p176
aVthere's still too much of an unfavorable tradeoff
p177
aVbetween scale, on the one hand, and resolution and speed, on the other.
p178
aVSo instead, we decided to take the column,
p179
aVand we decided to build it as a layered model,
p180
aVmade out of very many slices, thinly stacked over each other.
p181
aa(lp182
VWhat you're looking at here is an X-ray
p183
aVof the column that you just saw, viewed from the top.
p184
aVUnbeknownst to me at the time,
p185
aVbecause we had only seen the outside,
p186
aVthe surfaces were continuing to fold themselves,
p187
aVto grow on the inside of the column,
p188
aVwhich was quite a surprising discovery.
p189
aVFrom this shape, we calculated a cutting line,
p190
aVand then we gave this cutting line to a laser cutter
p191
aVto produce \u2014 and you're seeing a segment of it here \u2014
p192
aVvery many thin slices, individually cut, on top of each other.
p193
aa(lp194
VAnd this is a photo now, it's not a rendering,
p195
aVand the column that we ended up with
p196
aVafter a lot of work, ended up looking remarkably like the one
p197
aVthat we had designed in the computer.
p198
aVAlmost all of the details, almost all of the
p199
aVsurface intricacies were preserved.
p200
aa(lp201
VBut it was very labor intensive.
p202
aVThere's a huge disconnect at the moment still
p203
aVbetween the virtual and the physical.
p204
aVIt took me several months to design the column,
p205
aVbut ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds
p206
aVto calculate all of the 16 million faces.
p207
aVThe physical model, on the other hand,
p208
aVis 2,700 layers, one millimeter thick,
p209
aVit weighs 700 kilos, it's made of sheet that can cover
p210
aVthis entire auditorium.
p211
aVAnd the cutting path that the laser followed
p212
aVgoes from here to the airport and back again.
p213
aa(lp214
VBut it is increasingly possible.
p215
aVMachines are getting faster, it's getting less expensive,
p216
aVand there's some promising technological developments
p217
aVjust on the horizon.
p218
aVThese are images from the Gwangju Biennale.
p219
aVAnd in this case, I used ABS plastic to produce the columns,
p220
aVwe used the bigger, faster machine,
p221
aVand they have a steel core inside, so they're structural,
p222
aVthey can bear loads for once.
p223
aVEach column is effectively a hybrid of two columns.
p224
aVYou can see a different column in the mirror,
p225
aVif there's a mirror behind the column
p226
aVthat creates a sort of an optical illusion.
p227
aa(lp228
VSo where does this leave us?
p229
aVI think this project gives us a glimpse of the unseen objects that await us
p230
aVif we as architects begin to think about designing not the object,
p231
aVbut a process to generate objects.
p232
aVI've shown one simple process that was inspired by nature;
p233
aVthere's countless other ones.
p234
aVIn short, we have no constraints.
p235
aVInstead, we have processes in our hands right now
p236
aVthat allow us to create structures at all scales
p237
aVthat we couldn't even have dreamt up.
p238
aVAnd, if I may add, at one point we will build them.
p239
aa(lp240
VThank you. (Applause)

VI'm here today to talk about a disturbing question,
p5
aVwhich has an equally disturbing answer.
p6
aVMy topic is the secrets of domestic violence,
p7
aVand the question I'm going to tackle
p8
aVis the one question everyone always asks:
p9
aVWhy does she stay?
p10
aVWhy would anyone stay with a man who beats her?
p11
aVI'm not a psychiatrist, a social worker
p12
aVor an expert in domestic violence.
p13
aVI'm just one woman with a story to tell.
p14
aa(lp15
VI was 22. I had just graduated from Harvard College.
p16
aVI had moved to New York City for my first job
p17
aVas a writer and editor at Seventeen magazine.
p18
aVI had my first apartment,
p19
aVmy first little green American Express card,
p20
aVand I had a very big secret.
p21
aVMy secret was that I had this gun
p22
aVloaded with hollow-point bullets pointed at my head
p23
aVby the man who I thought was my soulmate,
p24
aVmany, many times.
p25
aVThe man who I loved more than anybody on Earth
p26
aVheld a gun to my head and threatened to kill me
p27
aVmore times than I can even remember.
p28
aVI'm here to tell you the story of crazy love,
p29
aVa psychological trap disguised as love,
p30
aVone that millions of women and even a few men
p31
aVfall into every year.
p32
aVIt may even be your story.
p33
aa(lp34
VI don't look like a typical domestic violence survivor.
p35
aVI have a B.A. in English from Harvard College,
p36
aVan MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School.
p37
aVI've spent most of my career working for Fortune 500 companies
p38
aVincluding Johnson & Johnson, Leo Burnett and The Washington Post.
p39
aVI've been married for almost 20 years to my second husband
p40
aVand we have three kids together.
p41
aVMy dog is a black lab, and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan.
p42
aV(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VSo my first message for you is that domestic violence
p45
aVhappens to everyone \u2014
p46
aVall races, all religions, all income and education levels.
p47
aVIt's everywhere.
p48
aVAnd my second message is that everyone thinks
p49
aVdomestic violence happens to women,
p50
aVthat it's a women's issue.
p51
aVNot exactly.
p52
aVOver 85 percent of abusers are men, and domestic abuse
p53
aVhappens only in intimate, interdependent, long-term relationships,
p54
aVin other words, in families,
p55
aVthe last place we would want or expect to find violence,
p56
aVwhich is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing.
p57
aa(lp58
VI would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth
p59
aVwho would stay with a man who beats me,
p60
aVbut in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age.
p61
aVI was 22, and in the United States,
p62
aVwomen ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely
p63
aVto be domestic violence victims
p64
aVas women of other ages,
p65
aVand over 500 women and girls this age
p66
aVare killed every year by abusive partners,
p67
aVboyfriends, and husbands in the United States.
p68
aa(lp69
VI was also a very typical victim because I knew nothing
p70
aVabout domestic violence, its warning signs or its patterns.
p71
aa(lp72
VI met Conor on a cold, rainy January night.
p73
aVHe sat next to me on the New York City subway,
p74
aVand he started chatting me up.
p75
aVHe told me two things.
p76
aVOne was that he, too, had just graduated from an Ivy League school,
p77
aVand that he worked at a very impressive Wall Street bank.
p78
aVBut what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting
p79
aVwas that he was smart and funny
p80
aVand he looked like a farm boy.
p81
aVHe had these big cheeks, these big apple cheeks
p82
aVand this wheat-blond hair,
p83
aVand he seemed so sweet.
p84
aa(lp85
VOne of the smartest things Conor did, from the very beginning,
p86
aVwas to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship.
p87
aVHe did this especially at the beginning
p88
aVby idolizing me.
p89
aVWe started dating, and he loved everything about me,
p90
aVthat I was smart, that I'd gone to Harvard,
p91
aVthat I was passionate about helping teenage girls, and my job.
p92
aVHe wanted to know everything about my family
p93
aVand my childhood and my hopes and dreams.
p94
aVConor believed in me, as a writer and a woman,
p95
aVin a way that no one else ever had.
p96
aVAnd he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us
p97
aVby confessing his secret,
p98
aVwhich was that, as a very young boy starting at age four,
p99
aVhe had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused
p100
aVby his stepfather,
p101
aVand the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade,
p102
aVeven though he was very smart,
p103
aVand he'd spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life.
p104
aVWhich is why that Ivy League degree
p105
aVand the Wall Street job and his bright shiny future
p106
aVmeant so much to him.
p107
aVIf you had told me
p108
aVthat this smart, funny, sensitive man who adored me
p109
aVwould one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup,
p110
aVhow short my skirts were,
p111
aVwhere I lived, what jobs I took,
p112
aVwho my friends were and where I spent Christmas,
p113
aVI would have laughed at you,
p114
aVbecause there was not a hint of violence or control
p115
aVor anger in Conor at the beginning.
p116
aVI didn't know that the first stage
p117
aVin any domestic violence relationship
p118
aVis to seduce and charm the victim.
p119
aa(lp120
VI also didn't know that the second step is to isolate the victim.
p121
aVNow, Conor did not come home one day and announce,
p122
aV"You know, hey, all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great,
p123
aVbut I need to move into the next phase
p124
aVwhere I isolate you and I abuse you" \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p125
aV"so I need to get you out of this apartment
p126
aVwhere the neighbors can hear you scream
p127
aVand out of this city where you have friends and family
p128
aVand coworkers who can see the bruises."
p129
aVInstead, Conor came home one Friday evening
p130
aVand he told me that he had quit his job that day,
p131
aVhis dream job,
p132
aVand he said that he had quit his job because of me,
p133
aVbecause I had made him feel so safe and loved
p134
aVthat he didn't need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore,
p135
aVand he just wanted to get out of the city
p136
aVand away from his abusive, dysfunctional family,
p137
aVand move to a tiny town in New England
p138
aVwhere he could start his life over with me by his side.
p139
aVNow, the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York,
p140
aVand my dream job,
p141
aVbut I thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate,
p142
aVso I agreed, and I quit my job,
p143
aVand Conor and I left Manhattan together.
p144
aVI had no idea I was falling into crazy love,
p145
aVthat I was walking headfirst into a carefully laid
p146
aVphysical, financial and psychological trap.
p147
aa(lp148
VThe next step in the domestic violence pattern
p149
aVis to introduce the threat of violence
p150
aVand see how she reacts.
p151
aVAnd here's where those guns come in.
p152
aVAs soon as we moved to New England \u2014 you know,
p153
aVthat place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe \u2014
p154
aVhe bought three guns.
p155
aVHe kept one in the glove compartment of our car.
p156
aVHe kept one under the pillows on our bed,
p157
aVand the third one he kept in his pocket at all times.
p158
aVAnd he said that he needed those guns
p159
aVbecause of the trauma he'd experienced as a young boy.
p160
aVHe needed them to feel protected.
p161
aVBut those guns were really a message for me,
p162
aVand even though he hadn't raised a hand to me,
p163
aVmy life was already in grave danger every minute of every day.
p164
aa(lp165
VConor first physically attacked me
p166
aVfive days before our wedding.
p167
aVIt was 7 a.m. I still had on my nightgown.
p168
aVI was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment,
p169
aVand I got frustrated,
p170
aVand Conor used my anger as an excuse
p171
aVto put both of his hands around my neck
p172
aVand to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream,
p173
aVand he used the chokehold
p174
aVto hit my head repeatedly against the wall.
p175
aVFive days later, the ten bruises on my neck had just faded,
p176
aVand I put on my mother's wedding dress,
p177
aVand I married him.
p178
aa(lp179
VDespite what had happened,
p180
aVI was sure we were going to live happily ever after,
p181
aVbecause I loved him, and he loved me so much.
p182
aVAnd he was very, very sorry.
p183
aVHe had just been really stressed out by the wedding
p184
aVand by becoming a family with me.
p185
aVIt was an isolated incident,
p186
aVand he was never going to hurt me again.
p187
aa(lp188
VIt happened twice more on the honeymoon.
p189
aVThe first time, I was driving to find a secret beach
p190
aVand I got lost,
p191
aVand he punched me in the side of my head so hard
p192
aVthat the other side of my head repeatedly hit
p193
aVthe driver's side window.
p194
aVAnd then a few days later, driving home from our honeymoon,
p195
aVhe got frustrated by traffic,
p196
aVand he threw a cold Big Mac in my face.
p197
aVConor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week
p198
aVfor the next two and a half years of our marriage.
p199
aa(lp200
VI was mistaken in thinking that I was unique
p201
aVand alone in this situation.
p202
aVOne in three American women
p203
aVexperiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life,
p204
aVand the CDC reports that 15 million children
p205
aVare abused every year, 15 million.
p206
aVSo actually, I was in very good company.
p207
aa(lp208
VBack to my question:
p209
aVWhy did I stay?
p210
aVThe answer is easy.
p211
aVI didn't know he was abusing me.
p212
aVEven though he held those loaded guns to my head,
p213
aVpushed me down stairs,
p214
aVthreatened to kill our dog,
p215
aVpulled the key out of the car ignition as I drove down the highway,
p216
aVpoured coffee grinds on my head
p217
aVas I dressed for a job interview,
p218
aVI never once thought of myself as a battered wife.
p219
aVInstead, I was a very strong woman
p220
aVin love with a deeply troubled man,
p221
aVand I was the only person on Earth
p222
aVwho could help Conor face his demons.
p223
aa(lp224
VThe other question everybody asks is,
p225
aVwhy doesn't she just leave?
p226
aVWhy didn't I walk out? I could have left any time.
p227
aVTo me, this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask,
p228
aVbecause we victims know something you usually don't:
p229
aVIt's incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser.
p230
aVBecause the final step in the domestic violence pattern
p231
aVis kill her.
p232
aVOver 70 percent of domestic violence murders
p233
aVhappen after the victim has ended the relationship,
p234
aVafter she's gotten out,
p235
aVbecause then the abuser has nothing left to lose.
p236
aVOther outcomes include long-term stalking,
p237
aVeven after the abuser remarries;
p238
aVdenial of financial resources;
p239
aVand manipulation of the family court system
p240
aVto terrify the victim and her children,
p241
aVwho are regularly forced by family court judges
p242
aVto spend unsupervised time
p243
aVwith the man who beat their mother.
p244
aVAnd still we ask, why doesn't she just leave?
p245
aa(lp246
VI was able to leave,
p247
aVbecause of one final, sadistic beating
p248
aVthat broke through my denial.
p249
aVI realized that the man who I loved so much
p250
aVwas going to kill me if I let him.
p251
aVSo I broke the silence.
p252
aVI told everyone:
p253
aVthe police, my neighbors,
p254
aVmy friends and family, total strangers,
p255
aVand I'm here today because you all helped me.
p256
aa(lp257
VWe tend to stereotype victims
p258
aVas grisly headlines,
p259
aVself-destructive women, damaged goods.
p260
aVThe question, "Why does she stay?"
p261
aVis code for some people for, "It's her fault for staying,"
p262
aVas if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men
p263
aVintent upon destroying us.
p264
aa(lp265
VBut since publishing "Crazy Love,"
p266
aVI have heard hundreds of stories from men and women
p267
aVwho also got out,
p268
aVwho learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened,
p269
aVand who rebuilt lives \u2014 joyous, happy lives \u2014
p270
aVas employees, wives and mothers,
p271
aVlives completely free of violence, like me.
p272
aVBecause it turns out that I'm actually a very typical domestic violence victim
p273
aVand a typical domestic violence survivor.
p274
aVI remarried a kind and gentle man,
p275
aVand we have those three kids.
p276
aVI have that black lab, and I have that minivan.
p277
aVWhat I will never have again,
p278
aVever,
p279
aVis a loaded gun held to my head
p280
aVby someone who says that he loves me.
p281
aa(lp282
VRight now, maybe you're thinking,
p283
aV"Wow, this is fascinating,"
p284
aVor, "Wow, how stupid was she,"
p285
aVbut this whole time, I've actually been talking about you.
p286
aVI promise you there are several people
p287
aVlistening to me right now
p288
aVwho are currently being abused
p289
aVor who were abused as children
p290
aVor who are abusers themselves.
p291
aVAbuse could be affecting your daughter,
p292
aVyour sister, your best friend right now.
p293
aa(lp294
VI was able to end my own crazy love story
p295
aVby breaking the silence.
p296
aVI'm still breaking the silence today.
p297
aVIt's my way of helping other victims,
p298
aVand it's my final request of you.
p299
aVTalk about what you heard here.
p300
aVAbuse thrives only in silence.
p301
aVYou have the power to end domestic violence
p302
aVsimply by shining a spotlight on it.
p303
aVWe victims need everyone.
p304
aVWe need every one of you to understand
p305
aVthe secrets of domestic violence.
p306
aVShow abuse the light of day by talking about it
p307
aVwith your children, your coworkers,
p308
aVyour friends and family.
p309
aVRecast survivors as wonderful, lovable people
p310
aVwith full futures.
p311
aVRecognize the early signs of violence
p312
aVand conscientiously intervene,
p313
aVdeescalate it, show victims a safe way out.
p314
aVTogether we can make our beds,
p315
aVour dinner tables and our families
p316
aVthe safe and peaceful oases they should be.
p317
aa(lp318
VThank you.

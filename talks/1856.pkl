VI was in New York during Hurricane Sandy,
p5
aVand this little white dog called Maui
p6
aVwas staying with me.
p7
aVHalf the city was dark because of a power cut,
p8
aVand I was living on the dark side.
p9
aVNow, Maui was terrified of the dark,
p10
aVso I had to carry him up the stairs,
p11
aVactually down the stairs first, for his walk,
p12
aVand then bring him back up.
p13
aVI was also hauling gallons of bottles of water
p14
aVup to the seventh floor every day.
p15
aVAnd through all of this,
p16
aVI had to hold a torch between my teeth.
p17
aVThe stores nearby were out of flashlights
p18
aVand batteries and bread.
p19
aVFor a shower, I walked 40 blocks
p20
aVto a branch of my gym.
p21
aa(lp22
VBut these were not the major preoccupations of my day.
p23
aVIt was just as critical for me to be the first person in
p24
aVat a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers
p25
aVto juice my multiple devices.
p26
aVI started to prospect under the benches of bakeries
p27
aVand the entrances of pastry shops for plug points.
p28
aVI wasn't the only one.
p29
aVEven in the rain, people stood between Madison and 5th Avenue
p30
aVunder their umbrellas charging their cell phones
p31
aVfrom outlets on the street.
p32
aVNature had just reminded us
p33
aVthat it was stronger than all our technology,
p34
aVand yet here we were, obsessed about being wired.
p35
aa(lp36
VI think there's nothing like a crisis
p37
aVto tell you what's really important and what's not,
p38
aVand Sandy made me realize that our devices
p39
aVand their connectivity matter to us
p40
aVright up there with food and shelter.
p41
aVThe self as we once knew it no longer exists,
p42
aVand I think that an abstract, digital universe
p43
aVhas become a part of our identity,
p44
aVand I want to talk to you about what I think that means.
p45
aa(lp46
VI'm a novelist, and I'm interested in the self
p47
aVbecause the self and fiction have a lot in common.
p48
aVThey're both stories, interpretations.
p49
aVYou and I can experience things without a story.
p50
aVWe might run up the stairs too quickly
p51
aVand we might get breathless.
p52
aVBut the larger sense that we have of our lives,
p53
aVthe slightly more abstract one, is indirect.
p54
aVOur story of our life is based on direct experience,
p55
aVbut it's embellished.
p56
aVA novel needs scene after scene to build,
p57
aVand the story of our life needs an arc as well.
p58
aVIt needs months and years.
p59
aVDiscrete moments from our lives are its chapters.
p60
aVBut the story is not about these chapters.
p61
aVIt's the whole book.
p62
aVIt's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness,
p63
aVthe victories and the disappointments,
p64
aVbut it's because how because of these,
p65
aVand sometimes, more importantly, in spite of these,
p66
aVwe find our place in the world
p67
aVand we change it and we change ourselves.
p68
aVOur story, therefore, needs two dimensions of time:
p69
aVa long arc of time that is our lifespan,
p70
aVand the timeframe of direct experience
p71
aVthat is the moment.
p72
aVNow the self that experiences directly
p73
aVcan only exist in the moment,
p74
aVbut the one that narrates needs several moments,
p75
aVa whole sequence of them,
p76
aVand that's why our full sense of self
p77
aVneeds both immersive experience
p78
aVand the flow of time.
p79
aVNow, the flow of time is embedded in everything,
p80
aVin the erosion of a grain of sand,
p81
aVin the budding of a little bud into a rose.
p82
aVWithout it, we would have no music.
p83
aVOur own emotions and state of mind
p84
aVoften encode time,
p85
aVregret or nostalgia about the past,
p86
aVhope or dread about the future.
p87
aa(lp88
VI think that technology has altered that flow of time.
p89
aVThe overall time that we have for our narrative,
p90
aVour lifespan, has been increasing,
p91
aVbut the smallest measure, the moment, has shrunk.
p92
aVIt has shrunk because our instruments enable us
p93
aVin part to measure smaller and smaller units of time,
p94
aVand this in turn has given us a more granular understanding
p95
aVof the material world,
p96
aVand this granular understanding
p97
aVhas generated reams of data
p98
aVthat our brains can no longer comprehend
p99
aVand for which we need more and more complicated computers.
p100
aVAll of this to say that the gap
p101
aVbetween what we can perceive and what we can measure
p102
aVis only going to widen.
p103
aVScience can do things with and in a picosecond,
p104
aVbut you and I are never going to have the inner experience
p105
aVof a millionth of a millionth of a second.
p106
aVYou and I answer only to nature's rhythm and flow,
p107
aVto the sun, the moon and the seasons,
p108
aVand this is why we need that long arc of time
p109
aVwith the past, the present and the future
p110
aVto see things for what they are,
p111
aVto separate signal from noise
p112
aVand the self from sensations.
p113
aVWe need time's arrow to understand cause and effect,
p114
aVnot just in the material world,
p115
aVbut in our own intentions and our motivations.
p116
aVWhat happens when that arrow goes awry?
p117
aVWhat happens when time warps?
p118
aa(lp119
VSo many of us today have the sensation
p120
aVthat time's arrow is pointing everywhere
p121
aVand nowhere at once.
p122
aVThis is because time doesn't flow in the digital world
p123
aVin the same way that it does in the natural one.
p124
aVWe all know that the Internet has shrunk space
p125
aVas well as time.
p126
aVFar away over there is now here.
p127
aVNews from India is a stream on my smartphone app
p128
aVwhether I'm in New York or New Delhi.
p129
aVAnd that's not all.
p130
aVYour last job, your dinner reservations from last year,
p131
aVyour former friends, lie on a flat plain with today's friends,
p132
aVbecause the Internet also archives,
p133
aVand it warps the past.
p134
aVWith no distinction left between the past,
p135
aVthe present and the future, and the here or there,
p136
aVwe are left with this moment everywhere,
p137
aVthis moment that I'll call the digital now.
p138
aa(lp139
VJust how can we prioritize
p140
aVin the landscape of the digital now?
p141
aVThis digital now is not the present,
p142
aVbecause it's always a few seconds ahead,
p143
aVwith Twitter streams that are already trending
p144
aVand news from other time zones.
p145
aVThis isn't the now of a shooting pain in your foot
p146
aVor the second that you bite into a pastry
p147
aVor the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book.
p148
aVThis now bears very little physical
p149
aVor psychological reference to our own state.
p150
aVIts focus, instead, is to distract us
p151
aVat every turn on the road.
p152
aVEvery digital landmark is an invitation
p153
aVto leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else
p154
aVand do something else.
p155
aVAre you reading an interview by an author?
p156
aVWhy not buy his book? Tweet it. Share it.
p157
aVLike it. Find other books exactly like his.
p158
aVFind other people reading those books.
p159
aVTravel can be liberating,
p160
aVbut when it is incessant, we become
p161
aVpermanent exiles without repose.
p162
aVChoice is freedom, but not when it's constantly
p163
aVfor its own sake.
p164
aa(lp165
VNot just is the digital now far from the present,
p166
aVbut it's in direct competition with it,
p167
aVand this is because not just am I absent from it,
p168
aVbut so are you.
p169
aVNot just are we absent from it, but so is everyone else.
p170
aVAnd therein lies its greatest convenience and horror.
p171
aVI can order foreign language books in the middle of the night,
p172
aVshop for Parisian macarons,
p173
aVand leave video messages that get picked up later.
p174
aVAt all times, I can operate
p175
aVat a different rhythm and pace from you,
p176
aVwhile I sustain the illusion
p177
aVthat I'm tapped into you in real time.
p178
aa(lp179
VSandy was a reminder
p180
aVof how such an illusion can shatter.
p181
aVThere were those with power and water,
p182
aVand those without.
p183
aVThere are those who went back to their lives,
p184
aVand those who are still displaced
p185
aVafter so many months.
p186
aVFor some reason, technology seems to perpetuate
p187
aVthe illusion for those who have it that everyone does,
p188
aVand then, like an ironic slap in the face,
p189
aVit makes it true.
p190
aVFor example, it's said that there are more people
p191
aVin India with access to cell phones than toilets.
p192
aVNow if this rift, which is already so great
p193
aVin many parts of the world,
p194
aVbetween the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology,
p195
aVisn't somehow bridged,
p196
aVthere will be ruptures between the digital
p197
aVand the real.
p198
aVFor us as individuals who live in the digital now
p199
aVand spend most of our waking moments in it,
p200
aVthe challenge is to live in two streams of time
p201
aVthat are parallel and almost simultaneous.
p202
aVHow does one live inside distraction?
p203
aa(lp204
VWe might think that those younger than us,
p205
aVthose who are born into this, will adapt more naturally.
p206
aVPossibly, but I remember my childhood.
p207
aVI remember my grandfather revising
p208
aVthe capitals of the world with me.
p209
aVBuda and Pest were separated by the Danube,
p210
aVand Vienna had a Spanish riding school.
p211
aVIf I were a child today, I could easily learn this information
p212
aVwith apps and hyperlinks,
p213
aVbut it really wouldn't be the same,
p214
aVbecause much later, I went to Vienna,
p215
aVand I went to the Spanish riding school,
p216
aVand I could feel my grandfather right beside me.
p217
aVNight after night, he took me up on the terrace,
p218
aVon his shoulders, and pointed out Jupiter
p219
aVand Saturn and the Great Bear to me.
p220
aVAnd even here, when I look at the Great Bear,
p221
aVI get back that feeling of being a child,
p222
aVhanging onto his head and trying to balance myself
p223
aVon his shoulder,
p224
aVand I can get back that feeling of being a child again.
p225
aVWhat I had with my grandfather was wrapped
p226
aVso often in information and knowledge and fact,
p227
aVbut it was about so much more
p228
aVthan information or knowledge or fact.
p229
aVTime-warping technology challenges
p230
aVour deepest core,
p231
aVbecause we are able to archive the past
p232
aVand some of it becomes hard to forget,
p233
aVeven as the current moment
p234
aVis increasingly unmemorable.
p235
aVWe want to clutch, and we are left instead
p236
aVclutching at a series of static moments.
p237
aVThey're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them.
p238
aa(lp239
VBy archiving everything, we think that we can store it,
p240
aVbut time is not data.
p241
aVIt cannot be stored.
p242
aVYou and I know exactly what it means like
p243
aVto be truly present in a moment.
p244
aVIt might have happened while we were
p245
aVplaying an instrument,
p246
aVor looking into the eyes of someone we've known
p247
aVfor a very long time.
p248
aVAt such moments, our selves are complete.
p249
aVThe self that lives in the long narrative arc
p250
aVand the self that experiences the moment
p251
aVbecome one.
p252
aVThe present encapsulates the past
p253
aVand a promise for the future.
p254
aVThe present joins a flow of time
p255
aVfrom before and after.
p256
aa(lp257
VI first experienced these feelings with my grandmother.
p258
aVI wanted to learn to skip, and she found an old rope
p259
aVand she tucked up her sari
p260
aVand she jumped over it.
p261
aVI wanted to learn to cook, and she kept me in the kitchen,
p262
aVcutting, cubing and chopping for a whole month.
p263
aVMy grandmother taught me that things happen
p264
aVin the time they take, that time can't be fought,
p265
aVand because it will pass and it will move,
p266
aVwe owe the present moment our full attention.
p267
aVAttention is time.
p268
aVOne of my yoga instructors once said
p269
aVthat love is attention,
p270
aVand definitely from my grandmother,
p271
aVlove and attention were one and the same thing.
p272
aVThe digital world cannibalizes time,
p273
aVand in doing so, I want to suggest
p274
aVthat what it threatens
p275
aVis the completeness of ourselves.
p276
aVIt threatens the flow of love.
p277
aVBut we don't need to let it.
p278
aVWe can choose otherwise.
p279
aVWe've seen again and again
p280
aVjust how creative technology can be,
p281
aVand in our lives and in our actions,
p282
aVwe can choose those solutions and those innovations
p283
aVand those moments that restore the flow of time
p284
aVinstead of fragmenting it.
p285
aVWe can slow down and we can tune in
p286
aVto the ebb and flow of time.
p287
aVWe can choose to take time back.
p288
aa(lp289
VThank you.

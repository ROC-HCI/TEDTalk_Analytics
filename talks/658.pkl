VThis is my first time at TED. Normally, as an advertising man,
p5
aVI actually speak at TED Evil, which is TED's secret sister
p6
aVthat pays all the bills.
p7
aVIt's held every two years in Burma.
p8
aVAnd I particularly remember a really good speech
p9
aVby Kim Jong Il on how to get teens smoking again.
p10
aV(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VBut, actually, it's suddenly come to me after years working in the business,
p13
aVthat what we create in advertising,
p14
aVwhich is intangible value \u2014 you might call it perceived value,
p15
aVyou might call it badge value, subjective value,
p16
aVintangible value of some kind \u2014
p17
aVgets rather a bad rap.
p18
aVIf you think about it, if you want to live in a world in the future
p19
aVwhere there are fewer material goods, you basically have two choices.
p20
aVYou can either live in a world which is poorer,
p21
aVwhich people in general don't like.
p22
aVOr you can live in a world where actually intangible value
p23
aVconstitutes a greater part of overall value,
p24
aVthat actually intangible value, in many ways
p25
aVis a very, very fine substitute
p26
aVfor using up labor or limited resources
p27
aVin the creation of things.
p28
aa(lp29
VHere is one example. This is a train which goes from London to Paris.
p30
aVThe question was given to a bunch of engineers,
p31
aVabout 15 years ago, "How do we make the journey to Paris better?"
p32
aVAnd they came up with a very good engineering solution,
p33
aVwhich was to spend six billion pounds
p34
aVbuilding completely new tracks
p35
aVfrom London to the coast,
p36
aVand knocking about 40 minutes off a three-and-half-hour journey time.
p37
aVNow, call me Mister Picky. I'm just an ad man ...
p38
aV... but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey
p39
aVmerely to make it shorter.
p40
aVNow what is the hedonic opportunity cost
p41
aVon spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks?
p42
aa(lp43
VHere is my naive advertising man's suggestion.
p44
aVWhat you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top male
p45
aVand female supermodels,
p46
aVpay them to walk the length of the train, handing out free Chateau Petrus
p47
aVfor the entire duration of the journey.
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aV(Applause)
p50
aVNow, you'll still have about three billion pounds left in change,
p51
aVand people will ask for the trains to be slowed down.
p52
aV(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VNow, here is another naive advertising man's question again.
p55
aVAnd this shows that engineers,
p56
aVmedical people, scientific people,
p57
aVhave an obsession with solving the problems of reality,
p58
aVwhen actually most problems, once you reach a basic level of wealth
p59
aVin society, most problems are actually problems of perception.
p60
aVSo I'll ask you another question.
p61
aVWhat on earth is wrong with placebos?
p62
aVThey seem fantastic to me. They cost very little to develop.
p63
aVThey work extraordinarily well.
p64
aVThey have no side effects,
p65
aVor if they do, they're imaginary, so you can safely ignore them.
p66
aV(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VSo I was discussing this. And I actually went to the Marginal Revolution blog
p69
aVby Tyler Cowen. I don't know if anybody knows it.
p70
aVSomeone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further,
p71
aVand actually produce placebo education.
p72
aVThe point is that education doesn't actually work by teaching you things.
p73
aVIt actually works by giving you the impression
p74
aVthat you've had a very good education, which gives you an insane sense
p75
aVof unwarranted self-confidence,
p76
aVwhich then makes you very, very successful in later life.
p77
aVSo, welcome to Oxford, ladies and gentlemen.
p78
aV(Laughter)
p79
aV(Applause)
p80
aa(lp81
VBut, actually, the point of placebo education is interesting.
p82
aVHow many problems of life can be solved
p83
aVactually by tinkering with perception,
p84
aVrather than that tedious, hardworking and messy business
p85
aVof actually trying to change reality?
p86
aVHere's a great example from history. I've heard this attributed to several other kings,
p87
aVbut doing a bit of historical research,
p88
aVit seems to be Fredrick the Great.
p89
aVFredrick the Great of Prussia was very, very keen
p90
aVfor the Germans to adopt the potato and to eat it,
p91
aVbecause he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate,
p92
aVwheat and potatoes, you get less price volatility in bread.
p93
aVAnd you get a far lower risk of famine,
p94
aVbecause you actually had two crops to fall back on, not one.
p95
aa(lp96
VThe only problem is: potatoes, if you think about it, look pretty disgusting.
p97
aVAnd also, 18th century Prussians ate very, very few vegetables \u2014
p98
aVrather like contemporary Scottish people.
p99
aV(Laughter)
p100
aVSo, actually, he tried making it compulsory.
p101
aVThe Prussian peasantry said,
p102
aV"We can't even get the dogs to eat these damn things.
p103
aVThey are absolutely disgusting and they're good for nothing."
p104
aVThere are even records of people being executed
p105
aVfor refusing to grow potatoes.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo he tried plan B.
p108
aVHe tried the marketing solution, which is he declared the potato
p109
aVas a royal vegetable, and none but the royal family could consume it.
p110
aVAnd he planted it in a royal potato patch,
p111
aVwith guards who had instructions
p112
aVto guard over it, night and day,
p113
aVbut with secret instructions not to guard it very well.
p114
aV(Laughter)
p115
aVNow, 18th century peasants know that there is one
p116
aVpretty safe rule in life, which is if something is worth guarding,
p117
aVit's worth stealing.
p118
aVBefore long, there was a massive underground
p119
aVpotato-growing operation in Germany.
p120
aVWhat he'd effectively done is he'd re-branded the potato.
p121
aVIt was an absolute masterpiece.
p122
aa(lp123
VI told this story and a gentleman from Turkey came up to me and said,
p124
aV"Very, very good marketer, Fredrick the Great. But not a patch on Ataturk."
p125
aVAtaturk, rather like Nicolas Sarkozy,
p126
aVwas very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil,
p127
aVin Turkey, to modernize it.
p128
aVNow, boring people would have just simply banned the veil.
p129
aVBut that would have ended up with a lot of awful kickback
p130
aVand a hell of a lot of resistance.
p131
aVAtaturk was a lateral thinker.
p132
aVHe made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil.
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aV(Applause)
p135
aa(lp136
VI can't verify that fully, but it does not matter.
p137
aVThere is your environmental problem solved, by the way, guys:
p138
aVAll convicted child molesters
p139
aVhave to drive a Porsche Cayenne.
p140
aV(Laughter)
p141
aVWhat Ataturk realized actually is two very fundamental things.
p142
aVWhich is that, actually, first one,
p143
aVall value is actually relative.
p144
aVAll value is perceived value.
p145
aa(lp146
VFor those of you who don't speak Spanish, jugo de naranja \u2014 it's actually the Spanish for "orange juice."
p147
aVBecause actually it's not the dollar. It's actually the peso
p148
aVin Buenos Aires. Very clever Buenos Aires street vendors
p149
aVdecided to practice price discrimination
p150
aVto the detriment of any passing gringo tourists.
p151
aVAs an advertising man, I have to admire that.
p152
aa(lp153
VBut the first thing is that all value is subjective.
p154
aVSecond point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion.
p155
aVThese funny signs that flash your speed at you,
p156
aVsome of the new ones, on the bottom right,
p157
aVnow actually show a smiley face or a frowny face,
p158
aVto act as an emotional trigger.
p159
aVWhat's fascinating about these signs is they cost about 10 percent
p160
aVof the running cost of a conventional speed camera,
p161
aVbut they prevent twice as many accidents.
p162
aVSo, the bizarre thing, which is baffling
p163
aVto conventional, classically trained economists,
p164
aVis that a weird little smiley face
p165
aVhas a better effect on changing your behavior
p166
aVthan the threat of a £60 fine and three penalty points.
p167
aa(lp168
VTiny little behavioral economics detail:
p169
aVin Italy, penalty points go backwards.
p170
aVYou start with 12 and they take them away.
p171
aVBecause they found that loss aversion
p172
aVis a more powerful influence on people's behavior.
p173
aVIn Britain we tend to feel, "Whoa! Got another three!"
p174
aVNot so in Italy.
p175
aa(lp176
VAnother fantastic case of creating intangible value
p177
aVto replace actual or material value, which remember, is what,
p178
aVafter all, the environmental movement needs to be about:
p179
aVThis again is from Prussia, from, I think, about 1812, 1813.
p180
aVThe wealthy Prussians, to help in the war against the French,
p181
aVwere encouraged to give in all their jewelry.
p182
aVAnd it was replaced with replica jewelry
p183
aVmade of cast iron.
p184
aVHere's one: "Gold gab ich für Eisen, 1813."
p185
aVThe interesting thing is that for 50 years hence,
p186
aVthe highest status jewelry you could wear in Prussia
p187
aVwasn't made of gold or diamonds.
p188
aVIt was made of cast iron.
p189
aVBecause actually, never mind the actual intrinsic value
p190
aVof having gold jewelry. This actually
p191
aVhad symbolic value, badge value.
p192
aVIt said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo, the modern equivalent would of course be this.
p195
aV(Laughter)
p196
aVBut, actually, there is a thing, just as there are Veblen goods,
p197
aVwhere the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare \u2014
p198
aVthere are opposite kind of things
p199
aVwhere actually the value in them depends on them being
p200
aVubiquitous, classless and minimalistic.
p201
aa(lp202
VIf you think about it, Shakerism was a proto-environmental movement.
p203
aVAdam Smith talks about 18th century America,
p204
aVwhere the prohibition against visible displays of wealth was so great,
p205
aVit was almost a block in the economy in New England,
p206
aVbecause even wealthy farmers could find nothing to spend their money on
p207
aVwithout incurring the displeasure of their neighbors.
p208
aVIt's perfectly possible to create these social pressures
p209
aVwhich lead to more egalitarian societies.
p210
aa(lp211
VWhat's also interesting, if you look at products
p212
aVthat have a high component
p213
aVof what you might call messaging value,
p214
aVa high component of intangible value, versus their intrinsic value:
p215
aVThey are often quite egalitarian.
p216
aVIn terms of dress, denim is perhaps the perfect example of something
p217
aVwhich replaces material value with symbolic value.
p218
aVCoca-Cola. A bunch of you may be a load of pinkos,
p219
aVand you may not like the Coca-Cola company,
p220
aVbut it's worth remembering Andy Warhol's point about Coke.
p221
aVWhat Warhol said about Coke is, he said,
p222
aV"What I really like about Coca-Cola is the president of the United States
p223
aVcan't get a better Coke than the bum on the corner of the street."
p224
aVNow, that is, actually, when you think about it \u2014 we take it for granted \u2014
p225
aVit's actually a remarkable achievement,
p226
aVto produce something that's that democratic.
p227
aa(lp228
VNow, we basically have to change our views slightly.
p229
aVThere is a basic view that real value involves making things,
p230
aVinvolves labor. It involves engineering.
p231
aVIt involves limited raw materials.
p232
aVAnd that what we add on top is kind of false. It's a fake version.
p233
aVAnd there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it.
p234
aVIt patently veers toward propaganda.
p235
aVHowever, what we do have now
p236
aVis a much more variegated media ecosystem
p237
aVin which to kind of create this kind of value, and it's much fairer.
p238
aa(lp239
VWhen I grew up, this was basically the media environment of my childhood
p240
aVas translated into food.
p241
aVYou had a monopoly supplier. On the left,
p242
aVyou have Rupert Murdoch, or the BBC.
p243
aV(Laughter)
p244
aVAnd on your right you have a dependent public
p245
aVwhich is pathetically grateful for anything you give it.
p246
aV(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
VNowadays, the user is actually involved.
p249
aVThis is actually what's called, in the digital world, "user-generated content."
p250
aVAlthough it's called agriculture in the world of food.
p251
aV(Laughter)
p252
aVThis is actually called a mash-up,
p253
aVwhere you take content that someone else has produced
p254
aVand you do something new with it.
p255
aVIn the world of food we call it cooking.
p256
aVThis is food 2.0,
p257
aVwhich is food you produce for the purpose of sharing it with other people.
p258
aVThis is mobile food. British are very good at that.
p259
aVFish and chips in newspaper, the Cornish Pasty,
p260
aVthe pie, the sandwich.
p261
aVWe invented the whole lot of them.
p262
aVWe're not very good at food in general. Italians do great food,
p263
aVbut it's not very portable, generally.
p264
aV(Laughter)
p265
aa(lp266
VI only learned this the other day. The Earl of Sandwich didn't invent the sandwich.
p267
aVHe actually invented the toasty. But then, the Earl of Toasty would be a ridiculous name.
p268
aV(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
VFinally, we have contextual communication.
p271
aVNow, the reason I show you Pernod \u2014 it's only one example.
p272
aVEvery country has a contextual alcoholic drink. In France it's Pernod.
p273
aVIt tastes great within the borders of that country,
p274
aVbut absolute shite if you take it anywhere else.
p275
aV(Laughter)
p276
aVUnicum in Hungary, for example.
p277
aVThe Greeks have actually managed to produce something called Retsina,
p278
aVwhich even tastes shite when you're in Greece.
p279
aV(Laughter)
p280
aa(lp281
VBut so much communication now is contextual
p282
aVthat the capacity for actually nudging people,
p283
aVfor giving them better information \u2014 B.J. Fogg,
p284
aVat the University of Stanford, makes the point
p285
aVthat actually the mobile phone is \u2014
p286
aVHe's invented the phrase, "persuasive technologies."
p287
aVHe believes the mobile phone, by being location-specific,
p288
aVcontextual, timely and immediate,
p289
aVis simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented.
p290
aa(lp291
VNow, if we have all these tools at our disposal,
p292
aVwe simply have to ask the question,
p293
aVand Thaler and Sunstein have, of how we can use these more intelligently.
p294
aVI'll give you one example.
p295
aVIf you had a large red button of this kind, on the wall of your home,
p296
aVand every time you pressed it, it saved 50 dollars for you,
p297
aVput 50 dollars into your pension,
p298
aVyou would save a lot more.
p299
aVThe reason is that the interface fundamentally determines
p300
aVthe behavior. Okay?
p301
aa(lp302
VNow, marketing has done a very, very good job of creating
p303
aVopportunities for impulse buying.
p304
aVYet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving.
p305
aVIf you did this, more people would save more.
p306
aVIt's simply a question of changing the interface
p307
aVby which people make decisions,
p308
aVand the very nature of the decisions changes.
p309
aVObviously, I don't want people to do this,
p310
aVbecause as an advertising man I tend to regard saving as just
p311
aVconsumerism needlessly postponed.
p312
aV(Laughter)
p313
aVBut if anybody did want to do that,
p314
aVthat's the kind of thing we need to be thinking about, actually:
p315
aVfundamental opportunities to change human behavior.
p316
aa(lp317
VNow, I've got an example here from Canada.
p318
aVThere was a young intern at Ogilvy Canada
p319
aVcalled Hunter Somerville,
p320
aVwho was working in improv in Toronto,
p321
aVand got a part-time job in advertising,
p322
aVand was given the job of advertising Shreddies.
p323
aVNow this is the most perfect case of creating
p324
aVintangible, added value,
p325
aVwithout changing the product in the slightest.
p326
aVShreddies is a strange, square, whole-grain cereal,
p327
aVonly available in New Zealand, Canada and Britain.
p328
aVIt's Kraft's peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown.
p329
aV(Laughter)
p330
aVIn working out how you could re-launch Shreddies,
p331
aVhe came up with this.
p332
aa(lp333
VVideo: (Buzzer)
p334
aVMan: Shreddies is supposed to be square.
p335
aV(Laughter)
p336
aa(lp337
VWoman: Have any of these diamond shapes gone out?
p338
aV(Laughter)
p339
aa(lp340
VVoiceover: New Diamond Shreddies cereal.
p341
aVSame 100 percent whole-grain wheat in a delicious diamond shape.
p342
aV(Applause)
p343
aa(lp344
VRory Sutherland: I'm not sure this isn't the most perfect example
p345
aVof intangible value creation. All it requires is
p346
aVphotons, neurons, and a great idea to create this thing.
p347
aVI would say it's a work of genius.
p348
aVBut, naturally, you can't do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research.
p349
aa(lp350
VMan: So, Shreddies is actually producing a new product,
p351
aVwhich is something very exciting for them.
p352
aVSo they are introducing new Diamond Shreddies.
p353
aV(Laughter)
p354
aVSo I just want to get your first impressions when you see that,
p355
aVwhen you see the Diamond Shreddies box there.
p356
aV(Laughter)
p357
aa(lp358
VWoman: Weren't they square?
p359
aa(lp360
VWoman #2: I'm a little bit confused. Woman #3: They look like the squares to me.
p361
aa(lp362
VMan: They \u2014 Yeah, it's all in the appearance.
p363
aVBut it's kind of like flipping a six or a nine. Like a six,
p364
aVif you flip it over it looks like a nine.
p365
aVBut a six is very different from a nine.
p366
aa(lp367
VWoman # 3: Or an "M" and a "W". Man: An "M" and a "W", exactly.
p368
aa(lp369
VMan #2: [unclear]
p370
aVYou just looked like you turned it on its end. But when you see it like that
p371
aVit's more interesting looking.
p372
aa(lp373
VMan: Just try both of them.
p374
aVTake a square one there, first.
p375
aV(Laughter)
p376
aVMan: Which one did you prefer? Man #2: The first one.
p377
aa(lp378
VMan: The first one?
p379
aV(Laughter)
p380
aa(lp381
VRory Sutherland: Now, naturally, a debate raged.
p382
aVThere were conservative elements in Canada, unsurprisingly,
p383
aVwho actually resented this intrusion.
p384
aVSo, eventually, the manufacturers actually
p385
aVarrived at a compromise, which was the combo pack.
p386
aV(Laughter)
p387
aV(Applause)
p388
aV(Laughter)
p389
aa(lp390
VIf you think it's funny, bear in mind there is an organization called
p391
aVthe American Institute of Wine Economics,
p392
aVwhich actually does extensive research into perception of things,
p393
aVand discovers that except for among
p394
aVperhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people,
p395
aVthere is no correlation between quality and enjoyment
p396
aVin wine,
p397
aVexcept when you tell the people how expensive it is,
p398
aVin which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more.
p399
aVSo drink your wine blind in the future.
p400
aa(lp401
VBut this is both hysterically funny \u2014
p402
aVbut I think an important philosophical point,
p403
aVwhich is, going forward, we need more of this kind of value.
p404
aVWe need to spend more time appreciating what already exists,
p405
aVand less time agonizing over what else we can do.
p406
aa(lp407
VTwo quotations to more or less end with.
p408
aVOne of them is, "Poetry is when you make new things
p409
aVfamiliar and familiar things new."
p410
aVWhich isn't a bad definition of what our job is,
p411
aVto help people appreciate what is unfamiliar, but also
p412
aVto gain a greater appreciation, and place a far higher value on
p413
aVthose things which are already existing.
p414
aVThere is some evidence, by the way, that things like social networking help do that.
p415
aVBecause they help people share news.
p416
aVThey give badge value to everyday little trivial activities.
p417
aVSo they actually reduce the need for actually spending great money on display,
p418
aVand increase the kind of third-party
p419
aVenjoyment you can get from the smallest, simplest things in life. Which is magic.
p420
aa(lp421
VThe second one is the second G.K. Chesterton quote of this session,
p422
aVwhich is, "We are perishing for want of wonder, not for want of wonders,"
p423
aVwhich I think for anybody involved in technology, is perfectly true.
p424
aVAnd a final thing: When you place a value on things like health,
p425
aVlove, sex and other things,
p426
aVand learn to place a material value
p427
aVon what you've previously discounted
p428
aVfor being merely intangible, a thing not seen,
p429
aVyou realize you're much, much wealthier than you ever imagined.
p430
aVThank you very much indeed.
p431
aV(Applause)

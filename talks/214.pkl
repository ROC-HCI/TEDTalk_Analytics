VIt's a simple idea about nature.
p5
aVI want to say a word for nature
p6
aVbecause we haven't talked that much about it the last couple days.
p7
aVI want to say a word for the soil and the bees and the plants and the animals,
p8
aVand tell you about a tool, a very simple tool that I have found.
p9
aVAlthough it's really nothing more than a literary conceit; it's not a technology.
p10
aVIt's very powerful for, I think, changing our relationship to the natural world
p11
aVand to the other species on whom we depend.
p12
aVAnd that tool is very simply, as Chris suggested,
p13
aVlooking at us and the world from the plants' or the animals' point of view.
p14
aVIt's not my idea, other people have hit on it,
p15
aVbut I've tried to take it to some new places.
p16
aa(lp17
VLet me tell you where I got it.
p18
aVLike a lot of my ideas, like a lot of the tools I use,
p19
aVI found it in the garden; I'm a very devoted gardener.
p20
aVAnd there was a day about seven years ago: I was planting potatoes,
p21
aVit was the first week of May \u2014
p22
aVthis is New England, when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom;
p23
aVthey're just white clouds above.
p24
aVI was here, planting my chunks,
p25
aVcutting up potatoes and planting it,
p26
aVand the bees were working on this tree;
p27
aVbumblebees, just making this thing vibrate.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd one of the things I really like about gardening
p30
aVis that it doesn't take all your concentration,
p31
aVyou really can't get hurt \u2014 it's not like woodworking \u2014
p32
aVand you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation.
p33
aVAnd the question I asked myself that afternoon in the garden,
p34
aVworking alongside that bumblebee,
p35
aVwas: what did I and that bumblebee have in common?
p36
aVHow was our role in this garden similar and different?
p37
aVAnd I realized we actually had quite a bit in common:
p38
aVboth of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another,
p39
aVand both of us \u2014 probably, if I can imagine the bee's point of view \u2014
p40
aVthought we were calling the shots.
p41
aVI had decided what kind of potato I wanted to plant \u2014
p42
aVI had picked my Yukon Gold or Yellow Finn, or whatever it was \u2014
p43
aVand I had summoned those genes from a seed catalog across the country,
p44
aVbrought it, and I was planting it.
p45
aVAnd that bee, no doubt, assumed that it had decided,
p46
aV"I'm going for that apple tree, I'm going for that blossom,
p47
aVI'm going to get the nectar and I'm going to leave."
p48
aa(lp49
VWe have a grammar that suggests that's who we are;
p50
aVthat we are sovereign subjects in nature, the bee as well as me.
p51
aVI plant the potatoes, I weed the garden, I domesticate the species.
p52
aVBut that day, it occurred to me:
p53
aVwhat if that grammar is nothing more than a self-serving conceit?
p54
aVBecause, of course, the bee thinks he's in charge or she's in charge,
p55
aVbut we know better.
p56
aVWe know that what's going on between the bee and that flower
p57
aVis that bee has been cleverly manipulated by that flower.
p58
aVAnd when I say manipulated, I'm talking about in a Darwinian sense, right?
p59
aVI mean it has evolved a very specific set of traits \u2014
p60
aVcolor, scent, flavor, pattern \u2014 that has lured that bee in.
p61
aVAnd the bee has been cleverly fooled into taking the nectar,
p62
aVand also picking up some powder on its leg,
p63
aVand going off to the next blossom.
p64
aVThe bee is not calling the shots.
p65
aVAnd I realized then, I wasn't either.
p66
aa(lp67
VI had been seduced by that potato and not another
p68
aVinto planting its \u2014 into spreading its genes, giving it a little bit more habitat.
p69
aVAnd that's when I got the idea, which was, "Well, what would happen
p70
aVif we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us?"
p71
aVAnd agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention, not as a human technology,
p72
aVbut as a co-evolutionary development
p73
aVin which a group of very clever species, mostly edible grasses, had exploited us,
p74
aVfigured out how to get us to basically deforest the world.
p75
aVThe competition of grasses, right?
p76
aVAnd suddenly everything looked different.
p77
aVAnd suddenly mowing the lawn that day was a completely different experience.
p78
aa(lp79
VI had thought always \u2014 and in fact, had written this in my first book;
p80
aVthis was a book about gardening \u2014
p81
aVthat lawns were nature under culture's boot,
p82
aVthat they were totalitarian landscapes,
p83
aVand that when we mowed them we were cruelly suppressing the species
p84
aVand never letting it set seed or die or have sex.
p85
aVAnd that's what the lawn was.
p86
aVBut then I realized, "No, this is exactly what the grasses want us to do.
p87
aVI'm a dupe. I'm a dupe of the lawns, whose goal in life is to outcompete the trees,
p88
aVwho they compete with for sunlight."
p89
aVAnd so by getting us to mow the lawn, we keep the trees from coming back,
p90
aVwhich in New England happens very, very quickly.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo I started looking at things this way
p93
aVand wrote a whole book about it called "The Botany of Desire."
p94
aVAnd I realized that in the same way you can look at a flower
p95
aVand deduce all sorts of interesting things about the taste and the desires of bees \u2014
p96
aVthat they like sweetness, that they like this color and not that color, that they like symmetry \u2014
p97
aVwhat could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing?
p98
aVThat a certain kind of potato, a certain kind of drug,
p99
aVa sativa-indica Cannabis cross has something to say about us.
p100
aVAnd that, wouldn't this be kind of an interesting way to look at the world?
p101
aa(lp102
VNow, the test of any idea \u2014 I said it was a literary conceit \u2014
p103
aVis what does it get us?
p104
aVAnd when you're talking about nature, which is really my subject as a writer,
p105
aVhow does it meet the Aldo Leopold test?
p106
aVWhich is, does it make us better citizens of the biotic community?
p107
aVGet us to do things that leads to the support and perpetuation of the biota,
p108
aVrather than its destruction?
p109
aVAnd I would submit that this idea does this.
p110
aVSo, let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way,
p111
aVbesides some entertaining insights about human desire.
p112
aa(lp113
VAs an intellectual matter, looking at the world from other species' points of view
p114
aVhelps us deal with this weird anomaly,
p115
aVwhich is \u2014 and this is in the realm of intellectual history \u2014
p116
aVwhich is that we have this Darwinian revolution 150 years ago ...
p117
aVUgh. Mini-Me. (Laughter)
p118
aVWe have this intellectual, this Darwinian revolution in which, thanks to Darwin,
p119
aVwe figured out we are just one species among many;
p120
aVevolution is working on us the same way it's working on all the others;
p121
aVwe are acted upon as well as acting;
p122
aVwe are really in the fiber, the fabric of life.
p123
aVBut the weird thing is, we have not absorbed this lesson 150 years later;
p124
aVnone of us really believes this.
p125
aVWe are still Cartesians \u2014 the children of Descartes \u2014
p126
aVwho believe that subjectivity, consciousness, sets us apart;
p127
aVthat the world is divided into subjects and objects;
p128
aVthat there is nature on one side, culture on another.
p129
aVAs soon as you start seeing things from the plant's point of view or the animal's point of view,
p130
aVyou realize that the real literary conceit is that \u2014
p131
aVis the idea that nature is opposed to culture,
p132
aVthe idea that consciousness is everything \u2014
p133
aVand that's another very important thing it does.
p134
aa(lp135
VLooking at the world from other species' points of view
p136
aVis a cure for the disease of human self-importance.
p137
aVYou suddenly realize that consciousness \u2014
p138
aVwhich we value and we consider
p139
aVthe crowning achievement of nature,
p140
aVhuman consciousness \u2014 is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world.
p141
aVAnd it's kind of natural that we would think it was the best tool.
p142
aVBut, you know, there's a comedian who said,
p143
aV"Well, who's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important?
p144
aVWell, consciousness."
p145
aVSo when you look at the plants, you realize that there are other tools
p146
aVand they're just as interesting.
p147
aa(lp148
VI'll give you two examples, also from the garden:
p149
aVlima beans. You know what a lima bean does when it's attacked by spider mites?
p150
aVIt releases this volatile chemical that goes out into the world
p151
aVand summons another species of mite
p152
aVthat comes in and attacks the spider mite, defending the lima bean.
p153
aVSo what plants have \u2014 while we have consciousness, tool making, language,
p154
aVthey have biochemistry.
p155
aVAnd they have perfected that to a degree far beyond what we can imagine.
p156
aVTheir complexity, their sophistication, is something to really marvel at,
p157
aVand I think it's really the scandal of the Human Genome Project.
p158
aVYou know, we went into it thinking, 40,000 or 50,000 human genes
p159
aVand we came out with only 23,000.
p160
aVJust to give you grounds for comparison, rice: 35,000 genes.
p161
aVSo who's the more sophisticated species?
p162
aVWell, we're all equally sophisticated.
p163
aVWe've been evolving just as long,
p164
aVjust along different paths.
p165
aVSo, cure for self-importance, way to sort of make us feel the Darwinian idea.
p166
aVAnd that's really what I do as a writer, as a storyteller,
p167
aVis try to make people feel what we know and tell stories that actually
p168
aVhelp us think ecologically.
p169
aa(lp170
VNow, the other use of this is practical.
p171
aVAnd I'm going to take you to a farm right now,
p172
aVbecause I used this idea to develop my understanding of the food system
p173
aVand what I learned, in fact, is that we are all, now, being manipulated by corn.
p174
aVAnd the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today,
p175
aVto me, is the final triumph of corn over good sense. (Laughter) (Applause)
p176
aVIt is part of corn's scheme for world domination.
p177
aV(Laughter)
p178
aVAnd you will see, the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year
p179
aVand there will be that much more habitat
p180
aVbecause we've decided ethanol is going to help us.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo it helped me understand industrial agriculture,
p183
aVwhich of course is a Cartesian system.
p184
aVIt's based on this idea that we bend other species to our will
p185
aVand that we are in charge, and that we create these factories
p186
aVand we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of it
p187
aVor the fuel or whatever we want.
p188
aVLet me take you to a very different kind of farm.
p189
aa(lp190
VThis is a farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia.
p191
aVI went looking for a farm where these ideas
p192
aVabout looking at things from the species' point of view are actually implemented,
p193
aVand I found it in a man. The farmer's name is Joel Salatin.
p194
aVAnd I spent a week as an apprentice on his farm,
p195
aVand I took away from this some of the most hopeful news about our relationship to nature
p196
aVthat I've ever come across in 25 years of writing about nature.
p197
aVAnd that is this:
p198
aVthe farm is called Polyface, which means ...
p199
aVthe idea is he's got six different species of animals, as well as some plants,
p200
aVgrowing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement.
p201
aa(lp202
VIt's permaculture, those of you who know a little bit about this,
p203
aVsuch that the cows and the pigs and the sheep and the turkeys and the ...
p204
aVwhat else does he have?
p205
aVAll the six different species \u2014 rabbits, actually \u2014
p206
aVare all performing ecological services for one another,
p207
aVsuch that the manure of one is the lunch for the other
p208
aVand they take care of pests for one another.
p209
aVIt's a very elaborate and beautiful dance,
p210
aVbut I'm going to just give you a close-up on one piece of it,
p211
aVand that is the relationship between his cattle and his chickens, his laying hens.
p212
aVAnd I'll show you, if you take this approach, what you get, OK?
p213
aVAnd this is a lot more than growing food, as you'll see;
p214
aVthis is a different way to think about nature
p215
aVand a way to get away from the zero-sum notion,
p216
aVthe Cartesian idea that either nature's winning or we're winning,
p217
aVand that for us to get what we want, nature is diminished.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo, one day, cattle in a pen.
p220
aVThe only technology involved here is this cheap electric fencing:
p221
aVrelatively new, hooked to a car battery;
p222
aVeven I could carry a quarter-acre paddock, set it up in 15 minutes.
p223
aVCows graze one day. They move, OK?
p224
aVThey graze everything down, intensive grazing.
p225
aVHe waits three days,
p226
aVand then we towed in something called the Eggmobile.
p227
aVThe Eggmobile is a very rickety contraption \u2014
p228
aVit looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards \u2014
p229
aVbut it houses 350 chickens.
p230
aVHe tows this into the paddock three days later and opens the gangplank,
p231
aVturns them down, and 350 hens come streaming down the gangplank \u2014
p232
aVclucking, gossiping as chickens will \u2014
p233
aVand they make a beeline for the cow patties.
p234
aa(lp235
VAnd what they're doing is very interesting:
p236
aVthey're digging through the cow patties
p237
aVfor the maggots, the grubs, the larvae of flies.
p238
aVAnd the reason he's waited three days
p239
aVis because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day, those larvae will hatch
p240
aVand he'll have a huge fly problem.
p241
aVBut he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he can
p242
aVbecause they are the chickens' favorite form of protein.
p243
aa(lp244
VSo the chickens do their kind of little breakdance
p245
aVand they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs,
p246
aVand in the process they're spreading the manure out.
p247
aVVery useful second ecosystem service.
p248
aVAnd third, while they're in this paddock
p249
aVthey are, of course, defecating madly
p250
aVand their very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field.
p251
aVThey then move out to the next one,
p252
aVand in the course of just a few weeks, the grass just enters this blaze of growth.
p253
aVAnd within four or five weeks, he can do it again.
p254
aVHe can graze again, he can cut, he can bring in another species,
p255
aVlike the lambs, or he can make hay for the winter.
p256
aa(lp257
VNow, I want you to just look really close up onto what's happened there.
p258
aVSo, it's a very productive system.
p259
aVAnd what I need to tell you is that on 100 acres
p260
aVhe gets 40,000 pounds of beef; 30,000 pounds of pork; 25,000 dozen eggs;
p261
aV20,000 broilers; 1,000 turkeys; 1,000 rabbits \u2014
p262
aVan immense amount of food.
p263
aa(lp264
VYou know, you hear, "Can organic feed the world?"
p265
aVWell, look how much food you can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of ...
p266
aVagain, give each species what it wants,
p267
aVlet it realize its desires, its physiological distinctiveness.
p268
aVPut that in play.
p269
aa(lp270
VBut look at it from the point of view of the grass, now.
p271
aVWhat happens to the grass when you do this?
p272
aVWhen a ruminant grazes grass, the grass is cut from this height to this height,
p273
aVand it immediately does something very interesting.
p274
aVAny one of you who gardens knows that there is something called the root-shoot ratio,
p275
aVand plants need to keep the root mass
p276
aVin some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy.
p277
aVSo when they lose a lot of leaf mass, they shed roots;
p278
aVthey kind of cauterize them and the roots die.
p279
aVAnd the species in the soil go to work
p280
aVbasically chewing through those roots, decomposing them \u2014
p281
aVthe earthworms, the fungi, the bacteria \u2014 and the result is new soil.
p282
aVThis is how soil is created.
p283
aVIt's created from the bottom up.
p284
aVThis is how the prairies were built,
p285
aVthe relationship between bison and grasses.
p286
aa(lp287
VAnd what I realized when I understood this \u2014
p288
aVand if you ask Joel Salatin what he is, he'll tell you he's not a chicken farmer,
p289
aVhe's not a sheep farmer, he's not a cattle rancher; he's a grass farmer,
p290
aVbecause grass is really the keystone species of such a system \u2014
p291
aVis that, if you think about it, this completely contradicts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads,
p292
aVwhich is that for us to get what we want, nature is diminished.
p293
aVMore for us, less for nature.
p294
aVHere, all this food comes off this farm, and at the end of the season
p295
aVthere is actually more soil, more fertility and more biodiversity.
p296
aa(lp297
VIt's a remarkably hopeful thing to do.
p298
aVThere are a lot of farmers doing this today.
p299
aVThis is well beyond organic agriculture,
p300
aVwhich is still a Cartesian system, more or less.
p301
aVAnd what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species,
p302
aVtake account of the soil, that even with nothing more than this perspectival idea
p303
aV\u2014 because there is no technology involved here except for those fences,
p304
aVwhich are so cheap they could be all over Africa in no time \u2014
p305
aVthat we can take the food we need from the Earth
p306
aVand actually heal the Earth in the process.
p307
aa(lp308
VThis is a way to reanimate the world,
p309
aVand that's what's so exciting about this perspective.
p310
aVWhen we really begin to feel Darwin's insights in our bones,
p311
aVthe things we can do with nothing more than these ideas
p312
aVare something to be very hopeful about.
p313
aa(lp314
VThank you very much.

VOther people. Everyone is interested in other people.
p5
aVEveryone has relationships with other people,
p6
aVand they're interested in these relationships
p7
aVfor a variety of reasons.
p8
aVGood relationships, bad relationships,
p9
aVannoying relationships, agnostic relationships,
p10
aVand what I'm going to do is focus on the central piece
p11
aVof an interaction that goes on in a relationship.
p12
aVSo I'm going to take as inspiration the fact that we're all
p13
aVinterested in interacting with other people,
p14
aVI'm going to completely strip it of all its complicating features,
p15
aVand I'm going to turn that object, that simplified object,
p16
aVinto a scientific probe, and provide the early stages,
p17
aVembryonic stages of new insights into what happens
p18
aVin two brains while they simultaneously interact.
p19
aa(lp20
VBut before I do that, let me tell you a couple of things
p21
aVthat made this possible.
p22
aVThe first is we can now eavesdrop safely
p23
aVon healthy brain activity.
p24
aVWithout needles and radioactivity,
p25
aVwithout any kind of clinical reason, we can go down the street
p26
aVand record from your friends' and neighbors' brains
p27
aVwhile they do a variety of cognitive tasks, and we use
p28
aVa method called functional magnetic resonance imaging.
p29
aVYou've probably all read about it or heard about in some
p30
aVincarnation. Let me give you a two-sentence version of it.
p31
aVSo we've all heard of MRIs. MRIs use magnetic fields
p32
aVand radio waves and they take snapshots of your brain
p33
aVor your knee or your stomach,
p34
aVgrayscale images that are frozen in time.
p35
aVIn the 1990s, it was discovered you could use
p36
aVthe same machines in a different mode,
p37
aVand in that mode, you could make microscopic blood flow
p38
aVmovies from hundreds of thousands of sites independently in the brain.
p39
aVOkay, so what? In fact, the so what is, in the brain,
p40
aVchanges in neural activity, the things that make your brain work,
p41
aVthe things that make your software work in your brain,
p42
aVare tightly correlated with changes in blood flow.
p43
aVYou make a blood flow movie, you have an independent
p44
aVproxy of brain activity.
p45
aa(lp46
VThis has literally revolutionized cognitive science.
p47
aVTake any cognitive domain you want, memory,
p48
aVmotor planning, thinking about your mother-in-law,
p49
aVgetting angry at people, emotional response, it goes on and on,
p50
aVput people into functional MRI devices, and
p51
aVimage how these kinds of variables map onto brain activity.
p52
aVIt's in its early stages, and it's crude by some measures,
p53
aVbut in fact, 20 years ago, we were at nothing.
p54
aVYou couldn't do people like this. You couldn't do healthy people.
p55
aVThat's caused a literal revolution, and it's opened us up
p56
aVto a new experimental preparation. Neurobiologists,
p57
aVas you well know, have lots of experimental preps,
p58
aVworms and rodents and fruit flies and things like this.
p59
aVAnd now, we have a new experimental prep: human beings.
p60
aVWe can now use human beings to study and model
p61
aVthe software in human beings, and we have a few
p62
aVburgeoning biological measures.
p63
aa(lp64
VOkay, let me give you one example of the kinds of experiments that people do,
p65
aVand it's in the area of what you'd call valuation.
p66
aVValuation is just what you think it is, you know?
p67
aVIf you went and you were valuing two companies against
p68
aVone another, you'd want to know which was more valuable.
p69
aVCultures discovered the key feature of valuation thousands of years ago.
p70
aVIf you want to compare oranges to windshields, what do you do?
p71
aVWell, you can't compare oranges to windshields.
p72
aVThey're immiscible. They don't mix with one another.
p73
aVSo instead, you convert them to a common currency scale,
p74
aVput them on that scale, and value them accordingly.
p75
aVWell, your brain has to do something just like that as well,
p76
aVand we're now beginning to understand and identify
p77
aVbrain systems involved in valuation,
p78
aVand one of them includes a neurotransmitter system
p79
aVwhose cells are located in your brainstem
p80
aVand deliver the chemical dopamine to the rest of your brain.
p81
aVI won't go through the details of it, but that's an important
p82
aVdiscovery, and we know a good bit about that now,
p83
aVand it's just a small piece of it, but it's important because
p84
aVthose are the neurons that you would lose if you had Parkinson's disease,
p85
aVand they're also the neurons that are hijacked by literally
p86
aVevery drug of abuse, and that makes sense.
p87
aVDrugs of abuse would come in, and they would change
p88
aVthe way you value the world. They change the way
p89
aVyou value the symbols associated with your drug of choice,
p90
aVand they make you value that over everything else.
p91
aa(lp92
VHere's the key feature though. These neurons are also
p93
aVinvolved in the way you can assign value to literally abstract ideas,
p94
aVand I put some symbols up here that we assign value to
p95
aVfor various reasons.
p96
aVWe have a behavioral superpower in our brain,
p97
aVand it at least in part involves dopamine.
p98
aVWe can deny every instinct we have for survival for an idea,
p99
aVfor a mere idea. No other species can do that.
p100
aVIn 1997, the cult Heaven's Gate committed mass suicide
p101
aVpredicated on the idea that there was a spaceship
p102
aVhiding in the tail of the then-visible comet Hale-Bopp
p103
aVwaiting to take them to the next level. It was an incredibly tragic event.
p104
aVMore than two thirds of them had college degrees.
p105
aVBut the point here is they were able to deny their instincts for survival
p106
aVusing exactly the same systems that were put there
p107
aVto make them survive. That's a lot of control, okay?
p108
aa(lp109
VOne thing that I've left out of this narrative
p110
aVis the obvious thing, which is the focus of the rest of my
p111
aVlittle talk, and that is other people.
p112
aVThese same valuation systems are redeployed
p113
aVwhen we're valuing interactions with other people.
p114
aVSo this same dopamine system that gets addicted to drugs,
p115
aVthat makes you freeze when you get Parkinson's disease,
p116
aVthat contributes to various forms of psychosis,
p117
aVis also redeployed to value interactions with other people
p118
aVand to assign value to gestures that you do
p119
aVwhen you're interacting with somebody else.
p120
aa(lp121
VLet me give you an example of this.
p122
aVYou bring to the table such enormous processing power
p123
aVin this domain that you hardly even notice it.
p124
aa(lp125
VLet me just give you a few examples. So here's a baby.
p126
aVShe's three months old. She still poops in her diapers and she can't do calculus.
p127
aVShe's related to me. Somebody will be very glad that she's up here on the screen.
p128
aVYou can cover up one of her eyes, and you can still read
p129
aVsomething in the other eye, and I see sort of curiosity
p130
aVin one eye, I see maybe a little bit of surprise in the other.
p131
aa(lp132
VHere's a couple. They're sharing a moment together,
p133
aVand we've even done an experiment where you can cut out
p134
aVdifferent pieces of this frame and you can still see
p135
aVthat they're sharing it. They're sharing it sort of in parallel.
p136
aVNow, the elements of the scene also communicate this
p137
aVto us, but you can read it straight off their faces,
p138
aVand if you compare their faces to normal faces, it would be a very subtle cue.
p139
aa(lp140
VHere's another couple. He's projecting out at us,
p141
aVand she's clearly projecting, you know,
p142
aVlove and admiration at him.
p143
aa(lp144
VHere's another couple. (Laughter)
p145
aVAnd I'm thinking I'm not seeing love and admiration on the left. (Laughter)
p146
aVIn fact, I know this is his sister, and you can just see
p147
aVhim saying, "Okay, we're doing this for the camera,
p148
aVand then afterwards you steal my candy and you punch me in the face." (Laughter)
p149
aVHe'll kill me for showing that.
p150
aa(lp151
VAll right, so what does this mean?
p152
aVIt means we bring an enormous amount of processing power to the problem.
p153
aVIt engages deep systems in our brain, in dopaminergic
p154
aVsystems that are there to make you chase sex, food and salt.
p155
aVThey keep you alive. It gives them the pie, it gives
p156
aVthat kind of a behavioral punch which we've called a superpower.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo how can we take that and arrange a kind of staged
p159
aVsocial interaction and turn that into a scientific probe?
p160
aVAnd the short answer is games.
p161
aVEconomic games. So what we do is we go into two areas.
p162
aVOne area is called experimental economics. The other area is called behavioral economics.
p163
aVAnd we steal their games. And we contrive them to our own purposes.
p164
aVSo this shows you one particular game called an ultimatum game.
p165
aVRed person is given a hundred dollars and can offer
p166
aVa split to blue. Let's say red wants to keep 70,
p167
aVand offers blue 30. So he offers a 70-30 split with blue.
p168
aVControl passes to blue, and blue says, "I accept it,"
p169
aVin which case he'd get the money, or blue says,
p170
aV"I reject it," in which case no one gets anything. Okay?
p171
aVSo a rational choice economist would say, well,
p172
aVyou should take all non-zero offers.
p173
aVWhat do people do? People are indifferent at an 80-20 split.
p174
aVAt 80-20, it's a coin flip whether you accept that or not.
p175
aVWhy is that? You know, because you're pissed off.
p176
aVYou're mad. That's an unfair offer, and you know what an unfair offer is.
p177
aVThis is the kind of game done by my lab and many around the world.
p178
aVThat just gives you an example of the kind of thing that
p179
aVthese games probe. The interesting thing is, these games
p180
aVrequire that you have a lot of cognitive apparatus on line.
p181
aVYou have to be able to come to the table with a proper model of another person.
p182
aVYou have to be able to remember what you've done.
p183
aVYou have to stand up in the moment to do that.
p184
aVThen you have to update your model based on the signals coming back,
p185
aVand you have to do something that is interesting,
p186
aVwhich is you have to do a kind of depth of thought assay.
p187
aVThat is, you have to decide what that other person expects of you.
p188
aVYou have to send signals to manage your image in their mind.
p189
aVLike a job interview. You sit across the desk from somebody,
p190
aVthey have some prior image of you,
p191
aVyou send signals across the desk to move their image
p192
aVof you from one place to a place where you want it to be.
p193
aVWe're so good at this we don't really even notice it.
p194
aVThese kinds of probes exploit it. Okay?
p195
aa(lp196
VIn doing this, what we've discovered is that humans
p197
aVare literal canaries in social exchanges.
p198
aVCanaries used to be used as kind of biosensors in mines.
p199
aVWhen methane built up, or carbon dioxide built up,
p200
aVor oxygen was diminished, the birds would swoon
p201
aVbefore people would \u2014 so it acted as an early warning system:
p202
aVHey, get out of the mine. Things aren't going so well.
p203
aVPeople come to the table, and even these very blunt,
p204
aVstaged social interactions, and they, and there's just
p205
aVnumbers going back and forth between the people,
p206
aVand they bring enormous sensitivities to it.
p207
aVSo we realized we could exploit this, and in fact,
p208
aVas we've done that, and we've done this now in
p209
aVmany thousands of people, I think on the order of
p210
aVfive or six thousand. We actually, to make this
p211
aVa biological probe, need bigger numbers than that,
p212
aVremarkably so. But anyway,
p213
aVpatterns have emerged, and we've been able to take
p214
aVthose patterns, convert them into mathematical models,
p215
aVand use those mathematical models to gain new insights
p216
aVinto these exchanges. Okay, so what?
p217
aVWell, the so what is, that's a really nice behavioral measure,
p218
aVthe economic games bring to us notions of optimal play.
p219
aVWe can compute that during the game.
p220
aVAnd we can use that to sort of carve up the behavior.
p221
aa(lp222
VHere's the cool thing. Six or seven years ago,
p223
aVwe developed a team. It was at the time in Houston, Texas.
p224
aVIt's now in Virginia and London. And we built software
p225
aVthat'll link functional magnetic resonance imaging devices
p226
aVup over the Internet. I guess we've done up to six machines
p227
aVat a time, but let's just focus on two.
p228
aVSo it synchronizes machines anywhere in the world.
p229
aVWe synchronize the machines, set them into these
p230
aVstaged social interactions, and we eavesdrop on both
p231
aVof the interacting brains. So for the first time,
p232
aVwe don't have to look at just averages over single individuals,
p233
aVor have individuals playing computers, or try to make
p234
aVinferences that way. We can study individual dyads.
p235
aVWe can study the way that one person interacts with another person,
p236
aVturn the numbers up, and start to gain new insights
p237
aVinto the boundaries of normal cognition,
p238
aVbut more importantly, we can put people with
p239
aVclassically defined mental illnesses, or brain damage,
p240
aVinto these social interactions, and use these as probes of that.
p241
aVSo we've started this effort. We've made a few hits,
p242
aVa few, I think, embryonic discoveries.
p243
aVWe think there's a future to this. But it's our way
p244
aVof going in and redefining, with a new lexicon,
p245
aVa mathematical one actually, as opposed to the standard
p246
aVways that we think about mental illness,
p247
aVcharacterizing these diseases, by using the people
p248
aVas birds in the exchanges. That is, we exploit the fact
p249
aVthat the healthy partner, playing somebody with major depression,
p250
aVor playing somebody with autism spectrum disorder,
p251
aVor playing somebody with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
p252
aVwe use that as a kind of biosensor, and then we use
p253
aVcomputer programs to model that person, and it gives us
p254
aVa kind of assay of this.
p255
aa(lp256
VEarly days, and we're just beginning, we're setting up sites
p257
aVaround the world. Here are a few of our collaborating sites.
p258
aVThe hub, ironically enough,
p259
aVis centered in little Roanoke, Virginia.
p260
aVThere's another hub in London, now, and the rest
p261
aVare getting set up. We hope to give the data away
p262
aVat some stage. That's a complicated issue
p263
aVabout making it available to the rest of the world.
p264
aVBut we're also studying just a small part
p265
aVof what makes us interesting as human beings, and so
p266
aVI would invite other people who are interested in this
p267
aVto ask us for the software, or even for guidance
p268
aVon how to move forward with that.
p269
aa(lp270
VLet me leave you with one thought in closing.
p271
aVThe interesting thing about studying cognition
p272
aVhas been that we've been limited, in a way.
p273
aVWe just haven't had the tools to look at interacting brains
p274
aVsimultaneously.
p275
aVThe fact is, though, that even when we're alone,
p276
aVwe're a profoundly social creature. We're not a solitary mind
p277
aVbuilt out of properties that kept it alive in the world
p278
aVindependent of other people. In fact, our minds
p279
aVdepend on other people. They depend on other people,
p280
aVand they're expressed in other people,
p281
aVso the notion of who you are, you often don't know
p282
aVwho you are until you see yourself in interaction with people
p283
aVthat are close to you, people that are enemies of you,
p284
aVpeople that are agnostic to you.
p285
aVSo this is the first sort of step into using that insight
p286
aVinto what makes us human beings, turning it into a tool,
p287
aVand trying to gain new insights into mental illness.
p288
aVThanks for having me. (Applause)

aV(Applause)

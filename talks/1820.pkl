VI'm going to be showing some of the cybercriminals'
p5
aVlatest and nastiest creations.
p6
aVSo basically, please don't go and download
p7
aVany of the viruses that I show you.
p8
aa(lp9
VSome of you might be wondering what a cybersecurity specialist looks like,
p10
aVand I thought I'd give you a quick insight
p11
aVinto my career so far.
p12
aVIt's a pretty accurate description.
p13
aVThis is what someone that specializes
p14
aVin malware and hacking looks like.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo today, computer viruses and trojans,
p17
aVdesigned to do everything from stealing data
p18
aVto watching you in your webcam
p19
aVto the theft of billions of dollars.
p20
aVSome malicious code today goes as far
p21
aVas targeting power, utilities and infrastructure.
p22
aa(lp23
VLet me give you a quick snapshot
p24
aVof what malicious code is capable of today.
p25
aVRight now, every second, eight new users
p26
aVare joining the Internet.
p27
aVToday, we will see 250,000 individual new computer viruses.
p28
aVWe will see 30,000 new infected websites.
p29
aVAnd, just to kind of tear down a myth here,
p30
aVlots of people think that when you get infected
p31
aVwith a computer virus, it's because you went to a porn site.
p32
aVRight? Well, actually, statistically speaking,
p33
aVif you only visit porn sites, you're safer.
p34
aVPeople normally write that down, by the way. (Laughter)
p35
aVActually, about 80 percent of these
p36
aVare small business websites getting infected.
p37
aa(lp38
VToday's cybercriminal, what do they look like?
p39
aVWell, many of you have the image, don't you,
p40
aVof the spotty teenager sitting in a basement,
p41
aVhacking away for notoriety.
p42
aVBut actually today, cybercriminals
p43
aVare wonderfully professional and organized.
p44
aVIn fact, they have product adverts.
p45
aVYou can go online and buy a hacking service
p46
aVto knock your business competitor offline.
p47
aVCheck out this one I found.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Video) Man: So you're here for one reason,
p50
aVand that reason is
p51
aVbecause you need your business competitors,
p52
aVrivals, haters, or whatever the reason is, or who,
p53
aVthey are to go down.
p54
aVWell you, my friend, you've came to the right place.
p55
aVIf you want your business competitors to go down,
p56
aVwell, they can.
p57
aVIf you want your rivals to go offline, well, they will.
p58
aVNot only that, we are providing a short-term-to-long-term
p59
aVDDOS service or scheduled attack,
p60
aVstarting five dollars per hour for small personal websites
p61
aVto 10 to 50 dollars per hour.
p62
aa(lp63
VJames Lyne: Now, I did actually pay
p64
aVone of these cybercriminals to attack my own website.
p65
aVThings got a bit tricky when I tried to expense it at the company.
p66
aVTurns out that's not cool.
p67
aVBut regardless, it's amazing how many products
p68
aVand services are available now to cybercriminals.
p69
aVFor example, this testing platform,
p70
aVwhich enables the cybercriminals
p71
aVto test the quality of their viruses
p72
aVbefore they release them on the world.
p73
aVFor a small fee, they can upload it
p74
aVand make sure everything is good.
p75
aa(lp76
VBut it goes further.
p77
aVCybercriminals now have crime packs
p78
aVwith business intelligence reporting dashboards
p79
aVto manage the distribution of their malicious code.
p80
aVThis is the market leader in malware distribution,
p81
aVthe Black Hole Exploit Pack,
p82
aVresponsible for nearly one third of malware distribution
p83
aVin the last couple of quarters.
p84
aVIt comes with technical installation guides,
p85
aVvideo setup routines,
p86
aVand get this, technical support.
p87
aVYou can email the cybercriminals and they'll tell you
p88
aVhow to set up your illegal hacking server.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo let me show you what malicious code looks like today.
p91
aVWhat I've got here is two systems,
p92
aVan attacker, which I've made look all Matrix-y and scary,
p93
aVand a victim, which you might recognize from home or work.
p94
aVNow normally, these would be on different sides
p95
aVof the planet or of the Internet,
p96
aVbut I've put them side by side
p97
aVbecause it makes things much more interesting.
p98
aa(lp99
VNow, there are many ways you can get infected.
p100
aVYou will have come in contact with some of them.
p101
aVMaybe some of you have received an email
p102
aVthat says something like, "Hi, I'm a Nigerian banker,
p103
aVand I'd like to give you 53 billion dollars
p104
aVbecause I like your face."
p105
aVOr funnycats.exe, which rumor has it
p106
aVwas quite successful in China's recent campaign against America.
p107
aa(lp108
VNow there are many ways you can get infected.
p109
aVI want to show you a couple of my favorites.
p110
aVThis is a little USB key.
p111
aVNow how do you get a USB key to run in a business?
p112
aVWell, you could try looking really cute.
p113
aVAwww.
p114
aVOr, in my case, awkward and pathetic.
p115
aVSo imagine this scenario: I walk into one of your businesses,
p116
aVlooking very awkward and pathetic, with a copy of my C.V.
p117
aVwhich I've covered in coffee,
p118
aVand I ask the receptionist to plug in this USB key
p119
aVand print me a new one.
p120
aVSo let's have a look here on my victim computer.
p121
aVWhat I'm going to do is plug in the USB key.
p122
aVAfter a couple of seconds,
p123
aVthings start to happen on the computer on their own,
p124
aVusually a bad sign.
p125
aVThis would, of course, normally happen
p126
aVin a couple of seconds, really, really quickly,
p127
aVbut I've kind of slowed it down
p128
aVso you can actually see the attack occurring.
p129
aVMalware is very boring otherwise.
p130
aVSo this is writing out the malicious code,
p131
aVand a few seconds later, on the left-hand side,
p132
aVyou'll see the attacker's screen get some interesting new text.
p133
aVNow if I place the mouse cursor over it,
p134
aVthis is what we call a command prompt,
p135
aVand using this we can navigate around the computer.
p136
aVWe can access your documents, your data.
p137
aVYou can turn on the webcam.
p138
aVThat can be very embarrassing.
p139
aVOr just to really prove a point,
p140
aVwe can launch programs like my personal favorite,
p141
aVthe Windows Calculator.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo isn't it amazing how much control
p144
aVthe attackers can get with such a simple operation?
p145
aVLet me show you how most malware
p146
aVis now distributed today.
p147
aVWhat I'm going to do is open up a website
p148
aVthat I wrote.
p149
aVIt's a terrible website. It's got really awful graphics.
p150
aVAnd it's got a comments section here
p151
aVwhere we can submit comments to the website.
p152
aVMany of you will have used something a bit like this before.
p153
aVUnfortunately, when this was implemented,
p154
aVthe developer was slightly inebriated
p155
aVand managed to forget
p156
aVall of the secure coding practices he had learned.
p157
aVSo let's imagine that our attacker,
p158
aVcalled Evil Hacker just for comedy value,
p159
aVinserts something a little nasty.
p160
aVThis is a script.
p161
aVIt's code which will be interpreted on the webpage.
p162
aVSo I'm going to submit this post,
p163
aVand then, on my victim computer,
p164
aVI'm going to open up the web browser
p165
aVand browse to my website,
p166
aVwww.incrediblyhacked.com.
p167
aVNotice that after a couple of seconds,
p168
aVI get redirected.
p169
aVThat website address at the top there,
p170
aVwhich you can just about see, microshaft.com,
p171
aVthe browser crashes as it hits one of these exploit packs,
p172
aVand up pops fake antivirus.
p173
aVThis is a virus pretending to look like antivirus software,
p174
aVand it will go through and it will scan the system,
p175
aVhave a look at what its popping up here.
p176
aVIt creates some very serious alerts.
p177
aVOh look, a child porn proxy server.
p178
aVWe really should clean that up.
p179
aVWhat's really insulting about this is
p180
aVnot only does it provide the attackers with access to your data,
p181
aVbut when the scan finishes, they tell you
p182
aVin order to clean up the fake viruses,
p183
aVyou have to register the product.
p184
aVNow I liked it better when viruses were free.
p185
aV(Laughter)
p186
aVPeople now pay cybercriminals money
p187
aVto run viruses,
p188
aVwhich I find utterly bizarre.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo anyway, let me change pace a little bit.
p191
aVChasing 250,000 pieces of malware a day
p192
aVis a massive challenge,
p193
aVand those numbers are only growing
p194
aVdirectly in proportion to the length of my stress line, you'll note here.
p195
aVSo I want to talk to you briefly
p196
aVabout a group of hackers we tracked for a year
p197
aVand actually found \u2014
p198
aVand this is a rare treat in our job.
p199
aVNow this was a cross-industry collaboration,
p200
aVpeople from Facebook, independent researchers,
p201
aVguys from Sophos.
p202
aVSo here we have a couple of documents
p203
aVwhich our cybercriminals had uploaded
p204
aVto a cloud service, kind of like Dropbox or SkyDrive,
p205
aVlike many of you might use.
p206
aVAt the top, you'll notice a section of source code.
p207
aVWhat this would do is send the cybercriminals
p208
aVa text message every day telling them how much money
p209
aVthey'd made that day,
p210
aVso a kind of cybercriminal billings report, if you will.
p211
aVIf you look closely, you'll notice a series
p212
aVof what are Russian telephone numbers.
p213
aVNow that's obviously interesting,
p214
aVbecause that gives us a way of finding our cybercriminals.
p215
aVDown below, highlighted in red,
p216
aVin the other section of source code,
p217
aVis this bit "leded:leded."
p218
aVThat's a username,
p219
aVkind of like you might have on Twitter.
p220
aa(lp221
VSo let's take this a little further.
p222
aVThere are a few other interesting pieces
p223
aVthe cybercriminals had uploaded.
p224
aVLots of you here will use smartphones
p225
aVto take photos and post them from the conference.
p226
aVAn interesting feature of lots of modern smartphones
p227
aVis that when you take a photo,
p228
aVit embeds GPS data about where that photo was taken.
p229
aVIn fact, I've been spending a lot of time
p230
aVon Internet dating sites recently,
p231
aVobviously for research purposes,
p232
aVand I've noticed that about 60 percent
p233
aVof the profile pictures on Internet dating sites
p234
aVcontain the GPS coordinates of where the photo was taken,
p235
aVwhich is kind of scary
p236
aVbecause you wouldn't give out your home address
p237
aVto lots of strangers,
p238
aVbut we're happy to give away our GPS coordinates
p239
aVto plus or minus 15 meters.
p240
aVAnd our cybercriminals had done the same thing.
p241
aVSo here's a photo which resolves to St. Petersburg.
p242
aVWe then deploy the incredibly advanced hacking tool.
p243
aVWe used Google.
p244
aVUsing the email address, the telephone number
p245
aVand the GPS data, on the left you see an advert
p246
aVfor a BMW that one of our cybercriminals is selling,
p247
aVon the other side an advert for the sale of sphynx kittens.
p248
aVOne of these was more stereotypical for me.
p249
aVA little more searching, and here's our cybercriminal.
p250
aVImagine, these are hardened cybercriminals
p251
aVsharing information scarcely.
p252
aVImagine what you could find
p253
aVabout each of the people in this room.
p254
aVA bit more searching through the profile
p255
aVand there's a photo of their office.
p256
aVThey were working on the third floor.
p257
aVAnd you can also see some photos
p258
aVfrom his business companion
p259
aVwhere he has a taste in a certain kind of image.
p260
aVIt turns out he's a member of the Russian Adult Webmasters Federation.
p261
aa(lp262
VBut this is where our investigation starts to slow down.
p263
aVThe cybercriminals have locked down their profiles quite well.
p264
aVAnd herein is the greatest lesson
p265
aVof social media and mobile devices for all of us right now.
p266
aVOur friends, our families and our colleagues
p267
aVcan break our security even when we do the right things.
p268
aVThis is MobSoft, one of the companies
p269
aVthat this cybercriminal gang owned,
p270
aVand an interesting thing about MobSoft
p271
aVis the 50-percent owner of this
p272
aVposted a job advert,
p273
aVand this job advert matched one of the telephone numbers
p274
aVfrom the code earlier.
p275
aVThis woman was Maria,
p276
aVand Maria is the wife of one of our cybercriminals.
p277
aVAnd it's kind of like she went into her social media settings
p278
aVand clicked on every option imaginable
p279
aVto make herself really, really insecure.
p280
aVBy the end of the investigation,
p281
aVwhere you can read the full 27-page report at that link,
p282
aVwe had photos of the cybercriminals,
p283
aVeven the office Christmas party
p284
aVwhen they were out on an outing.
p285
aVThat's right, cybercriminals do have Christmas parties,
p286
aVas it turns out.
p287
aVNow you're probably wondering what happened to these guys.
p288
aVLet me come back to that in just a minute.
p289
aa(lp290
VI want to change pace to one last little demonstration,
p291
aVa technique that is wonderfully simple and basic,
p292
aVbut is interesting in exposing how much information
p293
aVwe're all giving away,
p294
aVand it's relevant because it applies to us as a TED audience.
p295
aVThis is normally when people start kind of shuffling in their pockets
p296
aVtrying to turn their phones onto airplane mode desperately.
p297
aa(lp298
VMany of you all know about the concept
p299
aVof scanning for wireless networks.
p300
aVYou do it every time you take out your iPhone or your Blackberry
p301
aVand connect to something like TEDAttendees.
p302
aVBut what you might not know
p303
aVis that you're also beaming out a list of networks
p304
aVyou've previously connected to,
p305
aVeven when you're not using wireless actively.
p306
aVSo I ran a little scan.
p307
aVI was relatively inhibited compared to the cybercriminals,
p308
aVwho wouldn't be so concerned by law,
p309
aVand here you can see my mobile device.
p310
aVOkay? So you can see a list of wireless networks.
p311
aVTEDAttendees, HyattLB. Where do you think I'm staying?
p312
aVMy home network, PrettyFlyForAWifi,
p313
aVwhich I think is a great name.
p314
aVSophos_Visitors, SANSEMEA, companies I work with.
p315
aVLoganwifi, that's in Boston. HiltonLondon.
p316
aVCIASurveillanceVan.
p317
aVWe called it that at one of our conferences
p318
aVbecause we thought that would freak people out,
p319
aVwhich is quite fun.
p320
aVThis is how geeks party.
p321
aa(lp322
VSo let's make this a little bit more interesting.
p323
aVLet's talk about you.
p324
aVTwenty-three percent of you have been to Starbucks
p325
aVrecently and used the wireless network.
p326
aVThings get more interesting.
p327
aVForty-six percent of you I could link to a business,
p328
aVXYZ Employee network.
p329
aVThis isn't an exact science, but it gets pretty accurate.
p330
aVSeven hundred and sixty-one of you I could identify a hotel you'd been to recently,
p331
aVabsolutely with pinpoint precision somewhere on the globe.
p332
aVTwo hundred and thirty-four of you, well, I know where you live.
p333
aVYour wireless network name is so unique
p334
aVthat I was able to pinpoint it
p335
aVusing data available openly on the Internet
p336
aVwith no hacking or clever, clever tricks.
p337
aVAnd I should mention as well that
p338
aVsome of you do use your names,
p339
aV"James Lyne's iPhone," for example.
p340
aVAnd two percent of you have a tendency to extreme profanity.
p341
aa(lp342
VSo something for you to think about:
p343
aVAs we adopt these new applications and mobile devices,
p344
aVas we play with these shiny new toys,
p345
aVhow much are we trading off convenience
p346
aVfor privacy and security?
p347
aVNext time you install something,
p348
aVlook at the settings and ask yourself,
p349
aV"Is this information that I want to share?
p350
aVWould someone be able to abuse it?"
p351
aa(lp352
VWe also need to think very carefully
p353
aVabout how we develop our future talent pool.
p354
aVYou see, technology's changing at a staggering rate,
p355
aVand that 250,000 pieces of malware
p356
aVwon't stay the same for long.
p357
aVThere's a very concerning trend
p358
aVthat whilst many people coming out of schools now
p359
aVare much more technology-savvy, they know how to use technology,
p360
aVfewer and fewer people are following the feeder subjects
p361
aVto know how that technology works under the covers.
p362
aVIn the U.K., a 60 percent reduction since 2003,
p363
aVand there are similar statistics all over the world.
p364
aa(lp365
VWe also need to think about the legal issues in this area.
p366
aVThe cybercriminals I talked about,
p367
aVdespite theft of millions of dollars,
p368
aVactually still haven't been arrested,
p369
aVand at this point possibly never will.
p370
aVMost laws are national in their implementation,
p371
aVdespite cybercrime conventions, where the Internet
p372
aVis borderless and international by definition.
p373
aVCountries do not agree, which makes this area
p374
aVexceptionally challenging from a legal perspective.
p375
aa(lp376
VBut my biggest ask is this:
p377
aVYou see, you're going to leave here
p378
aVand you're going to see some astonishing stories in the news.
p379
aVYou're going to read about malware doing incredible
p380
aVand terrifying, scary things.
p381
aVHowever, 99 percent of it works
p382
aVbecause people fail to do the basics.
p383
aVSo my ask is this: Go online,
p384
aVfind these simple best practices,
p385
aVfind out how to update and patch your computer.
p386
aVGet a secure password.
p387
aVMake sure you use a different password
p388
aVon each of your sites and services online.
p389
aVFind these resources. Apply them.
p390
aa(lp391
VThe Internet is a fantastic resource
p392
aVfor business, for political expression,
p393
aVfor art and for learning.
p394
aVHelp me and the security community
p395
aVmake life much, much more difficult
p396
aVfor cybercriminals.
p397
aa(lp398
VThank you.

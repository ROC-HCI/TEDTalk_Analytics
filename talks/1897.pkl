VI want you to, for a moment,
p5
aVthink about playing a game of Monopoly.
p6
aVExcept in this game, that combination of skill, talent and luck
p7
aVthat helped earn you success in games, as in life,
p8
aVhas been rendered irrelevant,
p9
aVbecause this game's been rigged,
p10
aVand you've got the upper hand.
p11
aVYou've got more money,
p12
aVmore opportunities to move around the board,
p13
aVand more access to resources.
p14
aVAnd as you think about that experience,
p15
aVI want you to ask yourself:
p16
aVHow might that experience of being a privileged player in a rigged game
p17
aVchange the way you think about yourself
p18
aVand regard that other player?
p19
aa(lp20
VSo, we ran a study on the UC Berkeley campus
p21
aVto look at exactly that question.
p22
aVWe brought in more than 100 pairs of strangers into the lab,
p23
aVand with the flip of a coin,
p24
aVrandomly assigned one of the two to be a rich player in a rigged game.
p25
aVThey got two times as much money;
p26
aVwhen they passed Go, they collected twice the salary;
p27
aVand they got to roll both dice instead of one,
p28
aVso they got to move around the board a lot more.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd over the course of 15 minutes,
p33
aVwe watched through hidden cameras what happened.
p34
aVWhat I want to do today, for the first time,
p35
aVis show you a little bit of what we saw.
p36
aVYou'll to have to pardon the sound quality,
p37
aVbecause again, these were hidden cameras.
p38
aVSo we've provided subtitles.
p39
aa(lp40
V[Video] Rich Player: How many 500s did you have?
p41
aa(lp42
VPoor Player: Just one.
p43
aa(lp44
VRP: Are you serious? PP: Yeah.
p45
aa(lp46
VRP: I have three. (Laughs) I don't know why they gave me so much.
p47
aa(lp48
VPaul Piff: So it was quickly apparent to players that something was up.
p49
aVOne person clearly has a lot more money than the other person,
p50
aVand yet, as the game unfolded,
p51
aVwe saw very notable differences, dramatic differences begin to emerge
p52
aVbetween the two players.
p53
aVThe rich player started to move around the board louder,
p54
aVliterally smacking the board with the piece as he went around.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Game piece smacks board)
p57
aa(lp58
VWe were more likely to see signs of dominance
p59
aVand nonverbal signs, displays of power
p60
aVand celebration among the rich players.
p61
aa(lp62
VWe had a bowl of pretzels positioned off to the side.
p63
aVIt's on the bottom right corner.
p64
aVThat allowed us to watch participants' consummatory behavior.
p65
aVSo we're just tracking how many pretzels participants eat.
p66
aa(lp67
V[Video] RP: Are those pretzels a trick?
p68
aa(lp69
VPP: I don't know.
p70
aa(lp71
VPaul Piff: OK, so no surprises, people are on to us.
p72
aVThey wonder what that bowl of pretzels is doing there in the first place.
p73
aVOne even asks, like you just saw,
p74
aV"Is that bowl of pretzels there as a trick?"
p75
aVAnd yet, despite that, the power of the situation
p76
aVseems to inevitably dominate,
p77
aVand those rich players start to eat more pretzels.
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
V[Video] RP: I love pretzels.
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
VPaul Piff: And as the game went on,
p86
aVone of the really interesting and dramatic patterns
p87
aVthat we observed begin to emerge
p88
aVwas that the rich players actually started to become ruder
p89
aVtoward the other person \u2014
p90
aVless and less sensitive to the plight of those poor, poor players,
p91
aVand more and more demonstrative of their material success,
p92
aVmore likely to showcase how well they're doing.
p93
aa(lp94
V[Video] RP: I have money ...
p95
aa(lp96
V(Laughs) I have money for everything.
p97
aa(lp98
VPP: How much is that?
p99
aa(lp100
VRP: You owe me 24 dollars.
p101
aVYou're going to lose all your money soon.
p102
aVI'll buy it. I have so much money.
p103
aVI have so much money, it takes me forever.
p104
aa(lp105
VRP 2: I'm going to buy out this whole board.
p106
aa(lp107
VRP 3: You're going to run out of money soon.
p108
aVI'm pretty much untouchable at this point.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VPaul Piff: And here's what I think was really, really interesting:
p113
aVit's that, at the end of the 15 minutes,
p114
aVwe asked the players to talk about their experience during the game.
p115
aVAnd when the rich players talked about why they had inevitably won
p116
aVin this rigged game of Monopoly ...
p117
aa(lp118
V(Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
VThey talked about what they'd done to buy those different properties
p121
aVand earn their success in the game.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
VAnd they became far less attuned
p126
aVto all those different features of the situation \u2014
p127
aVincluding that flip of a coin \u2014
p128
aVthat had randomly gotten them into that privileged position
p129
aVin the first place.
p130
aVAnd that's a really, really incredible insight
p131
aVinto how the mind makes sense of advantage.
p132
aa(lp133
VNow, this game of Monopoly can be used
p134
aVas a metaphor for understanding society and its hierarchical structure,
p135
aVwherein some people have a lot of wealth and a lot of status,
p136
aVand a lot of people don't;
p137
aVthey have a lot less wealth and a lot less status
p138
aVand a lot less access to valued resources.
p139
aVAnd what my colleagues and I for the last seven years have been doing
p140
aVis studying the effects of these kinds of hierarchies.
p141
aVWhat we've been finding across dozens of studies
p142
aVand thousands of participants across this country
p143
aVis that as a person's levels of wealth increase,
p144
aVtheir feelings of compassion and empathy go down,
p145
aVand their feelings of entitlement, of deservingness,
p146
aVand their ideology of self-interest increase.
p147
aVIn surveys, we've found
p148
aVthat it's actually wealthier individuals who are more likely to moralize
p149
aVgreed being good,
p150
aVand that the pursuit of self-interest is favorable and moral.
p151
aVNow, what I want to do today is talk about some of the implications
p152
aVof this ideology self-interest,
p153
aVtalk about why we should care about those implications,
p154
aVand end with what might be done.
p155
aa(lp156
VSome of the first studies that we ran in this area
p157
aVlooked at helping behavior,
p158
aVsomething social psychologists call "pro-social behavior."
p159
aVAnd we were really interested
p160
aVin who's more likely to offer help to another person:
p161
aVsomeone who's rich or someone who's poor.
p162
aVIn one of the studies,
p163
aVwe bring rich and poor members of the community into the lab,
p164
aVand give each of them the equivalent of 10 dollars.
p165
aVWe told the participants they could keep these 10 dollars for themselves,
p166
aVor they could share a portion of it, if they wanted to,
p167
aVwith a stranger, who's totally anonymous.
p168
aVThey'll never meet that stranger; the stranger will never meet them.
p169
aVAnd we just monitor how much people give.
p170
aVIndividuals who made 25,000, sometimes under 15,000 dollars a year,
p171
aVgave 44 percent more of their money to the stranger
p172
aVthan did individuals making 150,000, 200,000 dollars a year.
p173
aa(lp174
VWe've had people play games
p175
aVto see who's more or less likely to cheat
p176
aVto increase their chances of winning a prize.
p177
aVIn one of the games, we actually rigged a computer
p178
aVso that die rolls over a certain score were impossible \u2014
p179
aVYou couldn't get above 12 in this game, and yet ...
p180
aVthe richer you were, the more likely you were to cheat in this game
p181
aVto earn credits toward a $50 cash prize \u2014
p182
aVsometimes by three to four times as much.
p183
aa(lp184
VWe ran another study
p185
aVwhere we looked at whether people would be inclined to take candy
p186
aVfrom a jar of candy that we explicitly identified
p187
aVas being reserved for children \u2014
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VI'm not kidding \u2014 I know it sounds like I'm making a joke.
p192
aVWe explicitly told participants:
p193
aV"This candy is for children participating in a developmental lab nearby.
p194
aVThey're in studies. This is for them."
p195
aVAnd we just monitored how much candy participants took.
p196
aVParticipants who felt rich took two times as much candy
p197
aVas participants who felt poor.
p198
aa(lp199
VWe've even studied cars.
p200
aVNot just any cars,
p201
aVbut whether drivers of different kinds of cars
p202
aVare more or less inclined to break the law.
p203
aVIn one of these studies,
p204
aVwe looked at whether drivers would stop for a pedestrian
p205
aVthat we had posed waiting to cross at a crosswalk.
p206
aVNow in California, as you all know,
p207
aVbecause I'm sure we all do this,
p208
aVit's the law to stop for a pedestrian who's waiting to cross.
p209
aVSo here's an example of how we did it.
p210
aVThat's our confederate off to the left, posing as a pedestrian.
p211
aVHe approaches as the red truck successfully stops.
p212
aVIn typical California fashion,
p213
aVit's overtaken by the bus who almost runs our pedestrian over.
p214
aa(lp215
V(Laughter)
p216
aa(lp217
VNow here's an example of a more expensive car,
p218
aVa Prius, driving through, and a BMW doing the same.
p219
aVSo we did this for hundreds of vehicles
p220
aVon several days,
p221
aVjust tracking who stops and who doesn't.
p222
aVWhat we found was as the expensiveness of a car increased ...
p223
aa(lp224
V(Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
Vthe drivers' tendencies to break the law increased as well.
p227
aVNone of the cars \u2014 none of the cars \u2014
p228
aVin our least expensive car category
p229
aVbroke the law.
p230
aVClose to 50 percent of the cars in our most expensive vehicle category
p231
aVbroke the law.
p232
aVWe've run other studies,
p233
aVfinding that wealthier individuals are more likely to lie in negotiations,
p234
aVto endorse unethical behavior at work,
p235
aVlike stealing cash from the cash register,
p236
aVtaking bribes, lying to customers.
p237
aa(lp238
VNow, I don't mean to suggest
p239
aVthat it's only wealthy people who show these patterns of behavior.
p240
aVNot at all \u2014 in fact, I think that we all,
p241
aVin our day-to-day, minute-by-minute lives,
p242
aVstruggle with these competing motivations
p243
aVof when or if to put our own interests above the interests of other people.
p244
aVAnd that's understandable,
p245
aVbecause the American dream is an idea
p246
aVin which we all have an equal opportunity to succeed and prosper,
p247
aVas long as we apply ourselves and work hard.
p248
aVAnd a piece of that means that sometimes,
p249
aVyou need to put your own interests
p250
aVabove the interests and well-being of other people around you.
p251
aVBut what we're finding is that the wealthier you are,
p252
aVthe more likely you are to pursue a vision of personal success,
p253
aVof achievement and accomplishment,
p254
aVto the detriment of others around you.
p255
aa(lp256
VHere I've plotted for you the mean household income
p257
aVreceived by each fifth and top five percent of the population
p258
aVover the last 20 years.
p259
aVIn 1993,
p260
aVthe differences between the different quintiles of the population,
p261
aVin terms of income,
p262
aVare fairly egregious.
p263
aVIt's not difficult to discern that there are differences.
p264
aVBut over the last 20 years, that significant difference
p265
aVhas become a Grand Canyon of sorts
p266
aVbetween those at the top and everyone else.
p267
aVIn fact, the top 20 percent of our population
p268
aVown close to 90 percent of the total wealth in this country.
p269
aa(lp270
VWe're at unprecedented levels of economic inequality.
p271
aVWhat that means is that wealth is not only becoming increasingly concentrated
p272
aVin the hands of a select group of individuals,
p273
aVbut the American dream is becoming increasingly unattainable
p274
aVfor an increasing majority of us.
p275
aVAnd if it's the case, as we've been finding,
p276
aVthat the wealthier you are,
p277
aVthe more entitled you feel to that wealth,
p278
aVand the more likely you are to prioritize your own interests
p279
aVabove the interests of other people,
p280
aVand be willing to do things to serve that self-interest,
p281
aVwell, then, there's no reason to think that those patterns will change.
p282
aVIn fact, there's every reason to think that they'll only get worse,
p283
aVand that's what it would look like if things just stayed the same,
p284
aVat the same linear rate, over the next 20 years.
p285
aa(lp286
VNow inequality \u2014 economic inequality \u2014
p287
aVis something we should all be concerned about,
p288
aVand not just because of those at the bottom of the social hierarchy,
p289
aVbut because individuals and groups
p290
aVwith lots of economic inequality do worse ...
p291
aVnot just the people at the bottom, everyone.
p292
aVThere's a lot of really compelling research
p293
aVcoming out from top labs all over the world,
p294
aVshowcasing the range of things that are undermined
p295
aVas economic inequality gets worse.
p296
aVSocial mobility, things we really care about,
p297
aVphysical health, social trust,
p298
aVall go down as inequality goes up.
p299
aVSimilarly, negative things in social collectives and societies,
p300
aVthings like obesity, and violence,
p301
aVimprisonment, and punishment,
p302
aVare exacerbated as economic inequality increases.
p303
aVAgain, these are outcomes not just experienced by a few,
p304
aVbut that resound across all strata of society.
p305
aVEven people at the top experience these outcomes.
p306
aa(lp307
VSo what do we do?
p308
aVThis cascade of self-perpetuating,
p309
aVpernicious, negative effects
p310
aVcould seem like something that's spun out of control,
p311
aVand there's nothing we can do about it,
p312
aVcertainly nothing we as individuals could do.
p313
aVBut in fact, we've been finding in our own laboratory research
p314
aVthat small psychological interventions,
p315
aVsmall changes to people's values,
p316
aVsmall nudges in certain directions,
p317
aVcan restore levels of egalitarianism and empathy.
p318
aVFor instance, reminding people of the benefits of cooperation
p319
aVor the advantages of community,
p320
aVcause wealthier individuals to be just as egalitarian
p321
aVas poor people.
p322
aa(lp323
VIn one study, we had people watch a brief video, just 46 seconds long,
p324
aVabout childhood poverty
p325
aVthat served as a reminder of the needs of others in the world around them.
p326
aVAnd after watching that,
p327
aVwe looked at how willing people were to offer up their own time
p328
aVto a stranger presented to them in the lab, who was in distress.
p329
aVAfter watching this video, an hour later,
p330
aVrich people became just as generous of their own time
p331
aVto help out this other person, a stranger,
p332
aVas someone who's poor,
p333
aVsuggesting that these differences are not innate or categorical,
p334
aVbut are so malleable to slight changes in people's values,
p335
aVand little nudges of compassion and bumps of empathy.
p336
aa(lp337
VAnd beyond the walls of our lab,
p338
aVwe're even beginning to see signs of change in society.
p339
aVBill Gates, one of our nation's wealthiest individuals,
p340
aVin his Harvard commencement speech,
p341
aVtalked about the problem of inequality facing society
p342
aVas being the most daunting challenge,
p343
aVand talked about what must be done to combat it,
p344
aVsaying, "Humanity's greatest advances are not in its discoveries \u2014
p345
aVbut in how those discoveries are applied
p346
aVto reduce inequity."
p347
aVAnd there's the Giving Pledge,
p348
aVin which more than 100 of our nation's wealthiest individuals
p349
aVare pledging half of their fortunes to charity.
p350
aVAnd there's the emergence of dozens of grassroots movements,
p351
aVlike "We are the 1 percent,"
p352
aV"Resource Generation,"
p353
aVor "Wealth for Common Good,"
p354
aVin which the most privileged members of the population,
p355
aVmembers of the one percent and elsewhere,
p356
aVpeople who are wealthy,
p357
aVare using their own economic resources,
p358
aVadults and youth alike \u2014 that's what's most striking to me \u2014
p359
aVleveraging their own privilege, their own economic resources,
p360
aVto combat inequality
p361
aVby advocating for social policies,
p362
aVchanges in social values
p363
aVand changes in people's behavior
p364
aVthat work against their own economic interests,
p365
aVbut that may ultimately restore the American dream.
p366
aa(lp367
VThank you.

VFor as long as I can remember,
p5
aVI have felt a very deep connection to animals and to the ocean.
p6
aVAnd at this age, my personal idol was Flipper the dolphin.
p7
aVAnd when I first learned about endangered species,
p8
aVI was truly distressed to know that every day,
p9
aVanimals were being wiped off the face of this Earth forever.
p10
aVAnd I wanted to do something to help, but I always wondered:
p11
aVWhat could one person possibly do to make a difference?
p12
aVAnd it would be 30 years,
p13
aVbut I would eventually get the answer to that question.
p14
aa(lp15
VWhen these heartbreaking images of oiled birds
p16
aVfinally began to emerge from the Gulf of Mexico last year
p17
aVduring the horrific BP oil spill,
p18
aVa German biologist by the name of Silvia Gaus was quoted as saying,
p19
aV"We should just euthanize all oiled birds,
p20
aVbecause studies have shown
p21
aVthat fewer than one percent of them survive after being released."
p22
aVAnd I could not disagree more.
p23
aVIn addition,
p24
aVI believe that every oiled animal deserves a second chance at life.
p25
aVAnd I want to tell you why I feel so strongly about this.
p26
aa(lp27
VOn June 23, 2000,
p28
aVa ship named the Treasure sank off the coast of Cape Town, South Africa,
p29
aVspilling 1,300 tons of fuel,
p30
aVwhich polluted the habitats of nearly half the entire world population
p31
aVof African penguins.
p32
aVNow, the ship sank between Robben Island to the south,
p33
aVand Dassen Island to the north \u2014
p34
aVtwo of the penguins' main breeding islands.
p35
aVAnd exactly six years and three days earlier,
p36
aVon June 20, 1994,
p37
aVa ship named the Apollo Sea sank near Dassen Island,
p38
aVoiling 10,000 penguins, half of which died.
p39
aa(lp40
VNow when the Treasure sank in 2000,
p41
aVit was the height of the best breeding season
p42
aVscientists had ever recorded for the African penguin,
p43
aVwhich at the time, was listed as a threatened species.
p44
aVAnd soon, nearly 20,000 penguins
p45
aVwere covered with this toxic oil.
p46
aVThe local seabird rescue center, named SANCCOB,
p47
aVimmediately launched a massive rescue operation,
p48
aVand this soon would become the largest animal rescue ever undertaken.
p49
aa(lp50
VAt the time, I was working down the street.
p51
aVI was a penguin aquarist at the New England Aquarium.
p52
aVAnd exactly 11 years ago yesterday,
p53
aVthe phone rang in the penguin office.
p54
aVAnd with that call, my life would change forever.
p55
aVIt was Estelle van Der Merwe calling from SANCCOB,
p56
aVsaying, "Please come help.
p57
aVWe have thousands of oiled penguins
p58
aVand thousands of willing but completely inexperienced volunteers.
p59
aVAnd we need penguin experts to come train and supervise them."
p60
aVSo two days later,
p61
aVI was on a plane headed for Cape Town
p62
aVwith a team of penguin specialists.
p63
aa(lp64
VAnd the scene inside of this building was devastating and surreal.
p65
aVIn fact, many people compared it to a war zone.
p66
aVLast week, a 10-year-old girl asked me:
p67
aV"What did it feel like when you first walked into that building
p68
aVand saw so many oiled penguins?"
p69
aVAnd this is what happened.
p70
aVI was instantly transported back to that moment in time.
p71
aVPenguins are very vocal birds and really, really noisy,
p72
aVso I expected to walk into this building
p73
aVand be met with this cacophony of honking and braying and squawking.
p74
aVBut instead,
p75
aVwhen we stepped through those doors and into the building,
p76
aVit was eerily silent.
p77
aVSo it was very clear
p78
aVthese were stressed, sick, traumatized birds.
p79
aa(lp80
VThe other thing that was so striking
p81
aVwas the sheer number of volunteers.
p82
aVUp to 1,000 people a day came to the rescue center.
p83
aVEventually, over the course of this rescue,
p84
aVmore than 12-and-a-half thousand volunteers
p85
aVcame from all over the world to Cape Town,
p86
aVto help save these birds.
p87
aVAnd the amazing thing was that not one of them had to be there.
p88
aVYet they were.
p89
aVSo for the few of us that were there in a professional capacity,
p90
aVthis extraordinary volunteer response to this animal crisis
p91
aVwas profoundly moving and awe-inspiring.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo the day after we arrived,
p94
aVtwo of us from the aquarium were put in charge of room two.
p95
aVRoom two had more than 4,000 oiled penguins in it.
p96
aVNow, mind you \u2014
p97
aVthree days earlier, we had 60 penguins under our care,
p98
aVso we were definitely overwhelmed
p99
aVand just a bit terrified \u2014 at least I was.
p100
aVPersonally, I really didn't know
p101
aVif I was capable of handling such a monstrous task.
p102
aVAnd collectively,
p103
aVwe really didn't know if we could pull this off.
p104
aVBecause we all knew that just six years earlier,
p105
aVhalf as many penguins had been oiled and rescued,
p106
aVand only half of them had survived.
p107
aVSo would it be humanly possible to save this many oiled penguins?
p108
aVWe just did not know.
p109
aa(lp110
VBut what gave us hope
p111
aVwere these incredibly dedicated and brave volunteers,
p112
aVthree of whom here are force-feeding penguins.
p113
aVYou may notice they're wearing very thick gloves.
p114
aVAnd what you should know about African penguins
p115
aVis that they have razor-sharp beaks.
p116
aVAnd before long,
p117
aVour bodies were covered head to toe
p118
aVwith these nasty wounds inflicted by the terrified penguins.
p119
aa(lp120
VNow the day after we arrived, a new crisis began to unfold.
p121
aVThe oil slick was now moving north towards Dassen Island,
p122
aVand the rescuers despaired,
p123
aVbecause they knew if the oil hit,
p124
aVit would not be possible to rescue any more oiled birds.
p125
aVAnd there really were no good solutions.
p126
aVBut then finally,
p127
aVone of the researchers threw out this crazy idea.
p128
aVHe said, "OK, why don't we try and collect the birds
p129
aVat the greatest risk of getting oiled" \u2014
p130
aVthey collected 20,000 \u2014
p131
aV"and we'll ship them 500 miles up the coast to Port Elizabeth
p132
aVin these open-air trucks,
p133
aVand release them into the clean waters there
p134
aVand let them swim back home?"
p135
aa(lp136
V(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
VSo three of those penguins \u2014 Peter, Pamela and Percy \u2014
p139
aVwore satellite tags,
p140
aVand the researchers crossed their fingers
p141
aVand hoped that by the time they got back home,
p142
aVthe oil would be cleaned up from their islands.
p143
aVAnd luckily, the day they arrived, it was.
p144
aVSo it had been a huge gamble, but it had paid off.
p145
aVAnd so they know now that they can use this strategy
p146
aVin future oil spills.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo in wildlife rescue as in life,
p149
aVwe learn from each previous experience,
p150
aVand we learn from both our successes and our failures.
p151
aVAnd the main thing learned during the Apollo Sea rescue in '94
p152
aVwas that most of those penguins had died due to the unwitting use
p153
aVof poorly ventilated transport boxes and trucks,
p154
aVbecause they just had not been prepared
p155
aVto deal with so many oiled penguins at once.
p156
aVSo in these six years between these two oil spills,
p157
aVthey've built thousands of these well-ventilated boxes.
p158
aVAnd as a result, during the Treasure rescue,
p159
aVjust 160 penguins died during the transport process,
p160
aVas opposed to 5,000.
p161
aVSo this alone was a huge victory.
p162
aa(lp163
VSomething else learned during the Apollo rescue
p164
aVwas how to train the penguins
p165
aVto take fish freely from their hands,
p166
aVusing these training boxes.
p167
aVAnd we used this technique again during the Treasure rescue.
p168
aVBut an interesting thing was noted during the training process.
p169
aVThe first penguins to make that transition to free feeding
p170
aVwere the ones that had a metal band on their wing
p171
aVfrom the Apollo Sea spill six years earlier.
p172
aVSo penguins learn from previous experience, too.
p173
aa(lp174
VSo all of those penguins had to have the oil meticulously cleaned
p175
aVfrom their bodies.
p176
aVIt would take two people at least an hour just to clean one penguin.
p177
aVWhen you clean a penguin,
p178
aVyou first have to spray it with a degreaser.
p179
aVAnd this brings me to my favorite story from the Treasure rescue.
p180
aVAbout a year prior to this oil spill,
p181
aVa 17-year-old student had invented a degreaser.
p182
aVAnd they'd been using it at SANCCOB with great success,
p183
aVso they began using it during the Treasure rescue.
p184
aVBut partway through, they ran out.
p185
aVSo in a panic, Estelle from SANCCOB called the student
p186
aVand said, "Please, you have to make more!"
p187
aVSo he raced to the lab
p188
aVand made enough to clean the rest of the birds.
p189
aVSo I just think it is the coolest thing
p190
aVthat a teenager invented a product
p191
aVthat helped save the lives of thousands of animals.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo what happened to those 20,000 oiled penguins?
p194
aVAnd was Silvia Gaus right?
p195
aVShould we routinely euthanize all oiled birds
p196
aVbecause most of them are going to die anyway?
p197
aVWell, she could not be more wrong.
p198
aVAfter half a million hours of grueling volunteer labor,
p199
aVmore than 90 percent of those oiled penguins
p200
aVwere successfully returned to the wild.
p201
aVAnd we know from follow-up studies
p202
aVthat they have lived just as long as never-oiled penguins,
p203
aVand bred nearly as successfully.
p204
aa(lp205
VAnd in addition,
p206
aVabout 3,000 penguin chicks were rescued and hand raised.
p207
aVAnd again, we know from long-term monitoring
p208
aVthat more of these hand-raised chicks survive to adulthood and breeding age
p209
aVthan do parent-raised chicks.
p210
aVArmed with this knowledge, SANCCOB has a chick-bolstering project,
p211
aVand every year, they rescue and raise abandoned chicks,
p212
aVand they have a very impressive, 80 percent success rate.
p213
aVThis is critically important,
p214
aVbecause one year ago,
p215
aVthe African penguin was declared endangered.
p216
aVAnd they could be extinct in less than 10 years
p217
aVif we don't do something now to protect them.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo what did I learn
p220
aVfrom this intense and unforgettable experience?
p221
aVPersonally, I learned that I am capable of handling so much more
p222
aVthan I ever dreamed possible.
p223
aVAnd I learned that one person can make a huge difference.
p224
aVJust look at that 17-year-old.
p225
aVAnd when we come together and work as one,
p226
aVwe can achieve extraordinary things.
p227
aVAnd truly, to be a part of something so much larger than yourself
p228
aVis the most rewarding experience you can possibly have.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo I'd like to leave you with one final thought
p231
aVand a challenge, if you will.
p232
aVMy mission as The Penguin Lady is to raise awareness and funding
p233
aVto protect penguins.
p234
aVBut why should any of you care about penguins?
p235
aVWell, you should care because they're an indicator species.
p236
aVAnd simply put: if penguins are dying, it means our oceans are dying.
p237
aVAnd we ultimately will be affected,
p238
aVbecause, as Sylvia Earle says,
p239
aV"The oceans are our life-support system."
p240
aVAnd the two main threats to penguins today
p241
aVare overfishing and global warming.
p242
aVAnd these are two things
p243
aVthat each one of us actually has the power to do something about.
p244
aVSo if we each do our part, together, we can make a difference,
p245
aVand we can help keep penguins from going extinct.
p246
aVHumans have always been the greatest threat to penguins,
p247
aVbut we are now their only hope.
p248
aa(lp249
VThank you.

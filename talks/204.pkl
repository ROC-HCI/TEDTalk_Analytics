VThank you so much. It's really scary to be here
p5
aVamong the smartest of the smart.
p6
aVI'm here to tell you a few tales of passion.
p7
aVThere's a Jewish saying that I love.
p8
aVWhat is truer than truth? Answer: The story.
p9
aVI'm a storyteller. I want to convey something that is truer than truth
p10
aVabout our common humanity.
p11
aVAll stories interest me, and some haunt me
p12
aVuntil I end up writing them.
p13
aVCertain themes keep coming up:
p14
aVjustice, loyalty, violence, death, political and social issues,
p15
aVfreedom.
p16
aVI'm aware of the mystery around us,
p17
aVso I write about coincidences, premonitions,
p18
aVemotions, dreams, the power of nature, magic.
p19
aa(lp20
VIn the last 20 years I have published a few books,
p21
aVbut I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006,
p22
aVwhen I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy.
p23
aVThat made me a celebrity. Now people recognize me in Macy's,
p24
aVand my grandchildren think that I'm cool.
p25
aV(Laughter)
p26
aVAllow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame.
p27
aVOne of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony,
p28
aVof the opening ceremony,
p29
aVcalled me and said that I had been selected
p30
aVto be one of the flag-bearers.
p31
aVI replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity
p32
aVbecause I'm as far as you can get from being an athlete.
p33
aVActually, I wasn't even sure that I could go around the stadium
p34
aVwithout a walker.
p35
aV(Laughter)
p36
aVI was told that this was no laughing matter.
p37
aVThis would be the first time
p38
aVthat only women would carry the Olympic flag.
p39
aVFive women, representing five continents,
p40
aVand three Olympic gold medal winners.
p41
aVMy first question was, naturally,
p42
aVwhat was I going to wear?
p43
aV(Laughter)
p44
aVA uniform, she said,
p45
aVand asked for my measurements.
p46
aVMy measurements.
p47
aVI had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak,
p48
aVlooking like the Michelin Man.
p49
aV(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VBy the middle of February,
p52
aVI found myself in Turin, where enthusiastic crowds
p53
aVcheered when any of the 80 Olympic teams was in the street.
p54
aVThose athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games.
p55
aVThey all deserved to win, but there's the element of luck.
p56
aVA speck of snow, an inch of ice, the force of the wind,
p57
aVcan determine the result of a race or a game.
p58
aVHowever, what matters most \u2014 more than training or luck \u2014 is the heart.
p59
aVOnly a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal.
p60
aVIt is all about passion.
p61
aVThe streets of Turin were covered with red posters
p62
aVannouncing the slogan of the Olympics.
p63
aa(lp64
VPassion lives here. Isn't it always true?
p65
aVHeart is what drives us and determines our fate.
p66
aVThat is what I need for my characters in my books:
p67
aVa passionate heart.
p68
aVI need mavericks, dissidents, adventurers, outsiders and rebels,
p69
aVwho ask questions, bend the rules and take risks.
p70
aVPeople like all of you in this room.
p71
aVNice people with common sense do not make interesting characters.
p72
aV(Laughter)
p73
aVThey only make good former spouses.
p74
aV(Laughter)
p75
aV(Applause)
p76
aa(lp77
VIn the green room of the stadium, I met the other flag bearers:
p78
aVthree athletes, and the actresses Susan Sarandon and Sophia Loren.
p79
aVAlso, two women with passionate hearts:
p80
aVWangari Maathai, the Nobel prizewinner from Kenya
p81
aVwho has planted 30 million trees. And by doing so,
p82
aVshe has changed the soil, the weather,
p83
aVin some places in Africa, and of course
p84
aVthe economic conditions in many villages.
p85
aVAnd Somaly Mam, a Cambodian activist who fights passionately
p86
aVagainst child prostitution.
p87
aVWhen she was 14 years old, her grandfather sold her to a brothel.
p88
aVShe told us of little girls raped by men who believe that
p89
aVhaving sex with a very young virgin will cure them from AIDS.
p90
aVAnd of brothels where children are forced to receive five,
p91
aV15 clients per day,
p92
aVand if they rebel, they are tortured with electricity.
p93
aVIn the green room I received my uniform.
p94
aVIt was not the kind of outfit that I normally wear,
p95
aVbut it was far from the Michelin Man suit
p96
aVthat I had anticipated. Not bad, really.
p97
aVI looked like a refrigerator.
p98
aV(Laughter)
p99
aVBut so did most of the flag-bearers, except Sophia Loren,
p100
aVthe universal symbol of beauty and passion.
p101
aVSophia is over 70 and she looks great.
p102
aVShe's sexy, slim and tall, with a deep tan.
p103
aVNow, how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles?
p104
aVI don't know.
p105
aVWhen asked in a TV interview, "How could she look so good?"
p106
aVShe replied, "Posture. My back is always straight,
p107
aVand I don't make old people's noises."
p108
aV(Laughter)
p109
aVSo, there you have some free advice
p110
aVfrom one of the most beautiful women on earth.
p111
aVNo grunting, no coughing, no wheezing,
p112
aVno talking to yourselves, no farting.
p113
aV(Laughter)
p114
aVWell, she didn't say that exactly.
p115
aV(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VAt some point around midnight,
p118
aVwe were summoned to the wings of the stadium,
p119
aVand the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag, and the music started \u2014
p120
aVby the way, the same music that starts here,
p121
aVthe Aida March.
p122
aVSophia Loren was right in front of me \u2014 she's a foot taller than I am,
p123
aVnot counting the poofy hair.
p124
aV(Laughter)
p125
aVShe walked elegantly, like a giraffe on the African savannah,
p126
aVholding the flag on her shoulder. I jogged behind
p127
aV(Laughter)
p128
aV\u2014 on my tiptoes \u2014 holding the flag on my extended arm,
p129
aVso that my head was actually under the damn flag.
p130
aV(Laughter)
p131
aVAll the cameras were, of course, on Sophia.
p132
aVThat was fortunate for me, because in most press photos
p133
aVI appear too, although often between Sophia's legs.
p134
aV(Laughter)
p135
aVA place where most men would love to be.
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aV(Applause)
p138
aa(lp139
VThe best four minutes of my entire life
p140
aVwere those in the Olympic stadium.
p141
aVMy husband is offended when I say this \u2014
p142
aValthough I have explained to him that what we do in private
p143
aVusually takes less than four minutes \u2014
p144
aV(Laughter)
p145
aV\u2014 so he shouldn't take it personally.
p146
aVI have all the press clippings of those four magnificent minutes,
p147
aVbecause I don't want to forget them
p148
aVwhen old age destroys my brain cells.
p149
aa(lp150
VI want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics \u2014
p151
aVpassion.
p152
aVSo here's a tale of passion.
p153
aVThe year is 1998, the place is a prison camp
p154
aVfor Tutsi refugees in Congo.
p155
aVBy the way, 80 percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world
p156
aVare women and girls.
p157
aVWe can call this place in Congo a death camp,
p158
aVbecause those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation.
p159
aVThe protagonists of this story
p160
aVare a young woman, Rose Mapendo, and her children.
p161
aVShe's pregnant and a widow.
p162
aVSoldiers have forced her to watch
p163
aVas her husband was tortured and killed.
p164
aVSomehow she manages to keep her seven children alive,
p165
aVand a few months later, she gives birth to premature twins.
p166
aVTwo tiny little boys.
p167
aVShe cuts the umbilical cord with a stick,
p168
aVand ties it with her own hair.
p169
aVShe names the twins after the camp's commanders
p170
aVto gain their favor, and feeds them with black tea
p171
aVbecause her milk cannot sustain them.
p172
aVWhen the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter,
p173
aVshe grabs hold of her and refuses to let go,
p174
aVeven when they hold a gun to her head.
p175
aVSomehow, the family survives for 16 months,
p176
aVand then, by extraordinary luck, and the passionate heart
p177
aVof a young American man, Sasha Chanoff,
p178
aVwho manages to put her in a U.S. rescue plane,
p179
aVRose Mapendo and her nine children end up in Phoenix, Arizona,
p180
aVwhere they're now living and thriving.
p181
aa(lp182
VMapendo, in Swahili, means great love.
p183
aVThe protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women
p184
aVlike Rose Mapendo.
p185
aVI don't make them up. There's no need for that.
p186
aVI look around and I see them everywhere.
p187
aVI have worked with women and for women all my life.
p188
aVI know them well.
p189
aVI was born in ancient times, at the end of the world,
p190
aVin a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family.
p191
aVNo wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist \u2014
p192
aValthough the term had not reached Chile yet,
p193
aVso nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me.
p194
aV(Laughter)
p195
aVI would soon find out that there was a high price to pay
p196
aVfor my freedom, and for questioning the patriarchy.
p197
aVBut I was happy to pay it, because for every blow that I received,
p198
aVI was able to deliver two.
p199
aV(Laughter)
p200
aVOnce, when my daughter Paula was in her twenties,
p201
aVshe said to me that feminism was dated, that I should move on.
p202
aVWe had a memorable fight. Feminism is dated?
p203
aVYes, for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today,
p204
aVbut not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world
p205
aVwho are still forced into premature marriage,
p206
aVprostitution, forced labor \u2014
p207
aVthey have children that they don't want or they cannot feed.
p208
aVThey have no control over their bodies or their lives.
p209
aVThey have no education and no freedom.
p210
aVThey are raped, beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity.
p211
aVFor most Western young women of today,
p212
aVbeing called a feminist is an insult.
p213
aVFeminism has never been sexy, but let me assure you
p214
aVthat it never stopped me from flirting,
p215
aVand I have seldom suffered from lack of men.
p216
aV(Laughter)
p217
aVFeminism is not dead, by no means.
p218
aVIt has evolved. If you don't like the term,
p219
aVchange it, for Goddess' sake.
p220
aVCall it Aphrodite, or Venus, or bimbo, or whatever you want;
p221
aVthe name doesn't matter,
p222
aVas long as we understand what it is about, and we support it.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo here's another tale of passion, and this is a sad one.
p225
aVThe place is a small women's clinic in a village in Bangladesh.
p226
aVThe year is 2005.
p227
aVJenny is a young American dental hygienist
p228
aVwho has gone to the clinic as a volunteer
p229
aVduring her three-week vacation.
p230
aVShe's prepared to clean teeth,
p231
aVbut when she gets there, she finds out that there are no doctors,
p232
aVno dentists, and the clinic is just a hut full of flies.
p233
aVOutside, there is a line of women
p234
aVwho have waited several hours to be treated.
p235
aVThe first patient is in excruciating pain
p236
aVbecause she has several rotten molars.
p237
aVJenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth.
p238
aVShe's not licensed for that; she has never done it.
p239
aVShe risks a lot and she's terrified.
p240
aVShe doesn't even have the proper instruments,
p241
aVbut fortunately she has brought some Novocaine.
p242
aVJenny has a brave and passionate heart.
p243
aVShe murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation.
p244
aVAt the end, the relieved patient kisses her hands.
p245
aVThat day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth.
p246
aVThe next morning, when she comes again to the so-called clinic,
p247
aVher first patient is waiting for her with her husband.
p248
aVThe woman's face looks like a watermelon.
p249
aVIt is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes.
p250
aVThe husband, furious, threatens to kill the American.
p251
aVJenny is horrified at what she has done,
p252
aVbut then the translator explains
p253
aVthat the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation.
p254
aVThe day before, her husband beat her up because she was not home
p255
aVin time to prepare dinner for him.
p256
aa(lp257
VMillions of women live like this today.
p258
aVThey are the poorest of the poor.
p259
aVAlthough women do two-thirds of the world's labor,
p260
aVthey own less than one percent of the world's assets.
p261
aVThey are paid less than men for the same work
p262
aVif they're paid at all, and they remain vulnerable
p263
aVbecause they have no economic independence,
p264
aVand they are constantly threatened by exploitation,
p265
aVviolence and abuse.
p266
aVIt is a fact that giving women education, work,
p267
aVthe ability to control their own income,
p268
aVinherit and own property, benefits the society.
p269
aVIf a woman is empowered,
p270
aVher children and her family will be better off.
p271
aVIf families prosper, the village prospers,
p272
aVand eventually so does the whole country.
p273
aa(lp274
VWangari Maathai goes to a village in Kenya.
p275
aVShe talks with the women and explains that the land is barren
p276
aVbecause they have cut and sold the trees.
p277
aVShe gets the women to plant new trees and water them,
p278
aVdrop by drop.
p279
aVIn a matter of five or six years, they have a forest,
p280
aVthe soil is enriched, and the village is saved.
p281
aVThe poorest and most backward societies
p282
aVare always those that put women down.
p283
aVYet this obvious truth is ignored by governments
p284
aVand also by philanthropy.
p285
aVFor every dollar given to a women's program,
p286
aV20 dollars are given to men's programs.
p287
aVWomen are 51 percent of humankind.
p288
aVEmpowering them will change everything \u2014
p289
aVmore than technology and design and entertainment.
p290
aVI can promise you that women working together \u2014
p291
aVlinked, informed and educated \u2014
p292
aVcan bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet.
p293
aVIn any war today, most of the casualties are civilians,
p294
aVmainly women and children. They are collateral damage.
p295
aVMen run the world, and look at the mess we have.
p296
aa(lp297
VWhat kind of world do we want?
p298
aVThis is a fundamental question that most of us are asking.
p299
aVDoes it make sense to participate in the existing world order?
p300
aVWe want a world where life is preserved
p301
aVand the quality of life is enriched for everybody,
p302
aVnot only for the privileged.
p303
aVIn January I saw an exhibit of Fernando Botero's paintings
p304
aVat the UC Berkeley library.
p305
aVNo museum or gallery in the United States,
p306
aVexcept for the New York gallery that carries Botero's work,
p307
aVhas dared to show the paintings because the theme
p308
aVis the Abu Ghraib prison.
p309
aVThey are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power,
p310
aVin the voluminous Botero style.
p311
aVI have not been able to get those images out of my mind
p312
aVor my heart.
p313
aVWhat I fear most is power with impunity.
p314
aVI fear abuse of power, and the power to abuse.
p315
aVIn our species, the alpha males define reality,
p316
aVand force the rest of the pack to accept that reality
p317
aVand follow the rules.
p318
aVThe rules change all the time, but they always benefit them,
p319
aVand in this case, the trickle-down effect,
p320
aVwhich does not work in economics, works perfectly.
p321
aVAbuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom.
p322
aVWomen and children, especially the poor, are at the bottom.
p323
aVEven the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse \u2014
p324
aVa woman or a child.
p325
aVI'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many
p326
aVthrough gender, income, race, and class.
p327
aa(lp328
VI think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes
p329
aVin our civilization.
p330
aVBut for real change, we need feminine energy
p331
aVin the management of the world.
p332
aVWe need a critical number of women in positions of power,
p333
aVand we need to nurture the feminine energy in men.
p334
aVI'm talking about men with young minds, of course.
p335
aVOld guys are hopeless; we have to wait for them to die off.
p336
aV(Laughter)
p337
aVYes, I would love to have Sophia Loren's long legs
p338
aVand legendary breasts.
p339
aVBut given a choice, I would rather have the warrior hearts
p340
aVof Wangari Maathai, Somaly Mam, Jenny and Rose Mapendo.
p341
aVI want to make this world good.
p342
aVNot better, but to make it good.
p343
aVWhy not? It is possible. Look around in this room \u2014
p344
aVall this knowledge, energy, talent and technology.
p345
aVLet's get off our fannies, roll up our sleeves
p346
aVand get to work, passionately,
p347
aVin creating an almost perfect world.
p348
aVThank you.

VI think the future of this planet depends on humans,
p5
aVnot technology, and we already have the knowledge \u2014
p6
aVwe\u2019re kind of at the endgame with knowledge.
p7
aVBut we\u2019re nowhere near the endgame
p8
aVwhen it comes to our perception.
p9
aVWe still have one foot in the dark ages.
p10
aVAnd when you listen to some of the presentations here \u2014
p11
aVand the extraordinary range of human capability, our understandings \u2014
p12
aVand then you contrast it with the fact
p13
aVwe still call this planet, "Earth:" it\u2019s pretty extraordinary \u2014
p14
aVwe have one foot in the dark ages.
p15
aa(lp16
VJust quickly: Aristotle, his thing was, "It\u2019s not flat, stupid, it\u2019s round."
p17
aVGalileo \u2014 he had the Inquisition, so he had to be a little bit more polite \u2014
p18
aVhis was, "It\u2019s not in the middle, you know."
p19
aVAnd Hawkes: "it\u2019s not earth, stupid, it\u2019s ocean."
p20
aVThis is an ocean planet.
p21
aVT.S. Eliot really said it for me \u2014
p22
aVand this should give you goose bumps:
p23
aV"we shall not cease from exploration
p24
aVand the end of our exploring shall be to return
p25
aVwhere we started and know the place for the first time."
p26
aVAnd the next lines are, "Through the unknown remembered gate,
p27
aVwhere the last of earth discovered
p28
aVis that which is the beginning."
p29
aVSo I have one message.
p30
aVIt seems to me that we\u2019re all pointed in the wrong direction.
p31
aa(lp32
VFor the rocketeers in the audience:
p33
aVI love what you\u2019re doing, I admire the guts,
p34
aVI admire the courage \u2014 but your rockets
p35
aVare pointed in the wrong goddamn direction.
p36
aV(Laughter)
p37
aVAnd it\u2019s all a question of perspective.
p38
aVLet me try and tell you \u2014
p39
aVI don\u2019t mean to insult you, but look,
p40
aVif I \u2014 and I\u2019m not doing this for real
p41
aVbecause it would be an insult,
p42
aVso I\u2019m going to pretend, and it softens the blow \u2014
p43
aVI\u2019m going to tell you what you\u2019re thinking.
p44
aVIf I held up a square that was one foot square and the color of earth,
p45
aVand I held up another square that was the root two square \u2014
p46
aVso it\u2019s 1.5 times bigger \u2014 and was the color of the oceans;
p47
aVand I said, what is the relative value of these two things?
p48
aVWell, it\u2019s the relative importance.
p49
aVYou would say \u2014 yeah, yeah, yeah, we all know this;
p50
aVwater covers twice the area of the planet than dry land.
p51
aVBut it\u2019s a question of perception,
p52
aVand if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking,
p53
aVif that\u2019s what you think I mean when I say,
p54
aV"This is an ocean planet stupidly called 'Earth.'"
p55
aVIf you think that that\u2019s the relative importance,
p56
aVtwo to one, you\u2019re wrong by a factor of ten.
p57
aVNow, you\u2019re not as thick as two short planks,
p58
aVbut you sound like it when you say "Earth,"
p59
aVbecause that demonstration, if I turned around this way \u2014
p60
aVthat earth plane would be as thin as paper.
p61
aVIt\u2019s a thin film, two-dimensional existence.
p62
aVThe ocean representation would have a depth to it.
p63
aVAnd if you hefted those two things
p64
aVyou might find that the relative scale of those is 20 to 1.
p65
aa(lp66
VIt turns out that something more than
p67
aV94 percent of life on earth is aquatic.
p68
aVThat means that us terrestrials occupy a minority.
p69
aVThe problem we have in believing that
p70
aVis \u2014 you just have to give up this notion
p71
aVthat this Earth was created for us.
p72
aVBecause it\u2019s a problem we have.
p73
aVIf this is an ocean planet
p74
aVand we only have a small minority of this planet,
p75
aVit just interferes with a lot of what humanity thinks.
p76
aa(lp77
VOkay. Let me criticize this thing.
p78
aVI\u2019m not talking about James Cameron \u2014
p79
aValthough I could, but I won\u2019t.
p80
aVYou really do have to go and see his latest film,
p81
aV"Aliens of the Deep." It\u2019s incredible.
p82
aVIt features two of these deep rovers,
p83
aVand I can criticize them because these sweet things are mine.
p84
aVThis, I think, represents one of the most beautiful
p85
aVclassic submersibles built.
p86
aVIf you look at that sub, you\u2019ll see a sphere.
p87
aVThis is an acryclic sphere.
p88
aVIt generates all of the buoyancy,
p89
aVall of the payload for the craft,
p90
aVand the batteries are down here hanging underneath,
p91
aVexactly like a balloon.
p92
aVThis is the envelope, and this is the gondola, the payload.
p93
aVAlso coming up later for criticism are these massive lights.
p94
aVAnd this one actually carries two great manipulators.
p95
aVIt actually is a very good working sub \u2014
p96
aVthat\u2019s what it was designed for.
p97
aVThe problem with it is \u2014
p98
aVand the reason I will never build another one like it \u2014
p99
aVis that this is a product of two-dimensional thinking.
p100
aVIt\u2019s what we humans do when we go in the ocean as engineers;
p101
aVwe take all our terrestrial hang-ups,
p102
aVall our constraints \u2014 importantly,
p103
aVthese two-dimensional constraints that we have,
p104
aVand they\u2019re so constrained we don\u2019t even understand it \u2014
p105
aVand we take them underwater.
p106
aVYou notice that Jim Cameron is sitting in a seat.
p107
aVA seat works in a two-dimensional world,
p108
aVwhere gravity blasts down on that seat, OK?
p109
aVAnd in a two-dimensional world,
p110
aVwe do know about the third dimension
p111
aVbut we don\u2019t use it because to go up
p112
aVrequires an awful lot of energy against gravity.
p113
aVAnd then our mothers tell us,
p114
aV"Careful you don\u2019t fall down" \u2014 because you\u2019ll fall over.
p115
aa(lp116
VNow, go into the real atmosphere of this planet.
p117
aVThis planet has an inner atmosphere of water;
p118
aVit\u2019s its inner atmosphere. It has two atmospheres \u2014
p119
aVa lesser, outer gaseous atmosphere, a lighter one.
p120
aVMost of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere.
p121
aVAnd that life enjoys a three-dimensional existence,
p122
aVwhich is alien to us.
p123
aVFish do not sit in seats.
p124
aV(Laughter)
p125
aVThey don\u2019t. Their mothers don\u2019t say to little baby fish,
p126
aV"Careful you don\u2019t fall over."
p127
aVThey don\u2019t fall over. They don\u2019t fall.
p128
aVThey live in a three-dimensional world
p129
aVwhere there is no difference in energy
p130
aVbetween going this way, that way, that way or that way.
p131
aVIt\u2019s truly a three-dimensional space.
p132
aVAnd we\u2019re only just beginning to grasp it.
p133
aVI don\u2019t know of any other submersible,
p134
aVor even remote, that just takes advantage
p135
aVthat this is a three-dimensional space.
p136
aa(lp137
VThis is the way we should be going into the oceans.
p138
aVThis is a three-dimensional machine.
p139
aVWhat we need to do is go down into the ocean with the freedom of the animals,
p140
aVand move in this three-dimensional space.
p141
aVOK, this is good stuff.
p142
aVThis is man\u2019s first attempt at flying underwater.
p143
aVRight now, I\u2019m just coming down on this gorgeous, big, giant manta ray.
p144
aVShe has twice the wingspan that I do.
p145
aVThere I\u2019m coming; she sees me.
p146
aVAnd just notice how she rolls under and turns;
p147
aVshe doesn\u2019t sit there and try and blow air into a tank
p148
aVand kind of flow up or sink down \u2014 she just rolls.
p149
aVAnd the craft that I\u2019m in \u2014
p150
aVthis hasn\u2019t been shown before.
p151
aVChris asked us to show stuff that hasn\u2019t been shown before.
p152
aVI wanted you to notice
p153
aVthat she actually turned to come back up.
p154
aVThere I am; I see her coming back,
p155
aVcoming up underneath me.
p156
aVI put reverse thrust and I try and pull gently down.
p157
aVI\u2019m trying to do everything very gently.
p158
aVWe spent about three hours together and she\u2019s beginning to trust me.
p159
aVAnd this ballet is controlled by this lady here.
p160
aVShe gets about that close and then she pulls away.
p161
aVSo now I try and go after her, but I\u2019m practicing flying.
p162
aVThis is the first flying machine. This was the first prototype.
p163
aVThis was a fly by wire. It has wings.
p164
aVThere\u2019re no silly buoyancy tanks \u2014
p165
aVit\u2019s permanently, positively buoyant.
p166
aVAnd then by moving through the water
p167
aVit\u2019s able to take that control.
p168
aVNow, look at that; look, it\u2019s \u2014 she just blew me away.
p169
aVShe just rolled right away from underneath.
p170
aVReally that\u2019s the only real dive I\u2019ve ever made in this machine.
p171
aa(lp172
VIt took 10 years to build.
p173
aVBut this lady here taught me, hah, taught me so much.
p174
aVWe just learned so much in three hours in the water there.
p175
aVI just had to go and build another machine.
p176
aVBut look here. Instead of blowing tanks
p177
aVand coming up slowly without thinking about it,
p178
aVit\u2019s a little bit of back pressure,
p179
aVand that sub just comes straight back up out of the water.
p180
aa(lp181
VThis is an internal Sony camera. Thank you, Sony.
p182
aVI don\u2019t really look that ugly,
p183
aVbut the camera is so close that it\u2019s just distorted.
p184
aVNow, there she goes, right overhead.
p185
aVThis is a wide-angle camera.
p186
aVShe\u2019s just a few inches off the top of my head.
p187
aV"Aah, ha, oh, he just crossed over the top of my head about,
p188
aVoh, I don\u2019t know, just so close."
p189
aVI come back up, not for air.
p190
aV"This is an incredible encounter with a manta. I\u2019m speechless.
p191
aVWe\u2019ve been just feet apart. I\u2019m going back down now."
p192
aVOkay, can we cut that? Lights back up please.
p193
aV(Applause)
p194
aa(lp195
VTrying to fly and keep up with that animal \u2014
p196
aVit wasn\u2019t the lack of maneuverability that we had.
p197
aVIt was the fact she was going so slow.
p198
aVI actually designed that to move faster through the water
p199
aVbecause I thought that was the thing
p200
aVthat we needed to do: to move fast and get range.
p201
aVBut after that encounter I really did want to go back with that animal and dance.
p202
aVShe wanted to dance.
p203
aVAnd so what we needed to do was increase the wing area
p204
aVso that we just had more grip, develop higher forces.
p205
aa(lp206
VSo the sub that was outside last year \u2014 this is the one.
p207
aVYou see the larger wing area here.
p208
aVAlso, clearly, it was such a powerful thing,
p209
aVwe wanted to try and bring other people
p210
aVbut we couldn't figure out how to do it.
p211
aVSo we opened the world\u2019s first flight school.
p212
aVThe rational for the world\u2019s first flight school
p213
aVgoes something like: when the coastguards come up to me and say \u2014
p214
aVthey used to leave us alone when we were diving
p215
aVthese goofy little spherical things,
p216
aVbut when we started flying around
p217
aVin underwater jet fighters they got a little nervous \u2014
p218
aVthey would come up and say,
p219
aV"Do you have a license for that?"
p220
aVAnd then I\u2019d put my sunglasses on, the beard
p221
aVthat would all sprout out, and I would say,
p222
aV"I don\u2019t need no stinking license."
p223
aV(Laughter)
p224
aV"I write these stinking license," which I do.
p225
aVSo Bob Gelfond's around here \u2014
p226
aVbut somebody in the audience here has license number 20.
p227
aVThey\u2019re one of the first subsea aviators.
p228
aVSo we\u2019ve run two flight schools.
p229
aVWhere the hell that goes, I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s a lot of fun.
p230
aVWhat comes next in 30 seconds? I can\u2019t tell you.
p231
aa(lp232
VBut the patent for underwater flight \u2014
p233
aVKaren and I, we were looking at it,
p234
aVsome business partners wanted us to patent it \u2014
p235
aVwe weren\u2019t sure about that.
p236
aVWe\u2019ve decided we\u2019re just going to let that go.
p237
aVIt just seems wrong to try and patent \u2014
p238
aV(Applause)
p239
aV\u2014 the freedom for underwater flight.
p240
aVSo anybody who wants to copy us
p241
aVand come and join us, go for it.
p242
aVThe other thing is that we\u2019ve got much lower costs.
p243
aVWe developed some other technology
p244
aVcalled spider optics, and Craig Ventner asked me
p245
aVto make an announcement here this morning:
p246
aVwe\u2019re going to be building a beautiful, little,
p247
aVsmall version of this \u2014 unmanned, super deep \u2014
p248
aVfor his boat to go and get back some deep sea DNA stuff.
p249
aV(Applause)
p250
aVThank you.

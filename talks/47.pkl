VWe've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising.
p5
aVSo I'll try and do that,
p6
aVbut I want to start with two things that everyone already knows.
p7
aVAnd the first one, in fact, is something that has been known
p8
aVfor most of recorded history,
p9
aVand that is, that the planet Earth, or the solar system,
p10
aVor our environment or whatever,
p11
aVis uniquely suited to sustain our evolution \u2014
p12
aVor creation, as it used to be thought \u2014
p13
aVand our present existence, and most important, our future survival.
p14
aa(lp15
VNowadays, this idea has a dramatic name: Spaceship Earth.
p16
aVAnd the idea there is that outside the spaceship,
p17
aVthe universe is implacably hostile,
p18
aVand inside is all we have, all we depend on,
p19
aVand we only get the one chance: if we mess up our spaceship,
p20
aVwe've got nowhere else to go.
p21
aVNow, the second thing that everyone already knows
p22
aVis that, contrary to what was believed for most of human history,
p23
aVhuman beings are not, in fact, the hub of existence.
p24
aVAs Stephen Hawking famously said,
p25
aVwe're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet
p26
aVthat's in orbit around a typical star,
p27
aVwhich is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy, and so on.
p28
aa(lp29
VNow, the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of saying
p30
aVthat we're at a very un-typical place, uniquely suited and so on,
p31
aVand the second one is saying that we're at a typical place.
p32
aVAnd, especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by
p33
aVand to inform your life decisions,
p34
aVthen they seem a little bit to conflict with each other.
p35
aVBut that doesn't prevent them from both being completely false.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd they are.
p40
aVSo let me start with the second one:
p41
aV"Typical." Well, is this a typical place?
p42
aVWell, let's look around, you know, look in a random direction,
p43
aVand we see a wall, and chemical scum \u2014
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
Vand that's not typical of the universe at all.
p48
aVAll you've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction
p49
aVand look back,
p50
aVand you won't see any walls or chemical scum at all \u2014
p51
aVall you see is a blue planet.
p52
aVAnd if you go further than that,
p53
aVyou'll see the Sun, the solar system and the stars and so on,
p54
aVbut that's still not typical of the universe,
p55
aVbecause stars come in galaxies.
p56
aVAnd most places in the universe, a typical place in the universe,
p57
aVis nowhere near any galaxies.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo let's go out further, till we're outside the galaxy, and look back,
p60
aVand yeah, there's the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us.
p61
aVAnd at this point, we've come 100,000 light-years from here.
p62
aVBut we're still nowhere near a typical place in the universe.
p63
aVTo get to a typical place,
p64
aVyou've got to go 1,000 times as far as that,
p65
aVinto intergalactic space.
p66
aVAnd so, what does that look like \u2014 "typical?"
p67
aVWhat does a "typical" place in the universe look like?
p68
aVWell, at enormous expense, TED has arranged
p69
aVa high-resolution immersion virtual reality rendering
p70
aVof the view from intergalactic space.
p71
aVCan we have the lights off, please, so we can see it?
p72
aa(lp73
VWell, not quite, not quite perfect.
p74
aa(lp75
VYou see, intergalactic space is completely dark, pitch dark.
p76
aVIt's so dark,
p77
aVthat if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you,
p78
aVand that star were to explode as a supernova,
p79
aVand you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you,
p80
aVyou still wouldn't be able to see even a glimmer.
p81
aVThat's how big and how dark the universe is.
p82
aVAnd that's despite the fact that a supernova is so bright,
p83
aVso brilliant an event,
p84
aVthat it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light-years.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd yet, from intergalactic space,
p89
aVit's so far away you wouldn't even see it.
p90
aVIt's also very cold out there \u2014
p91
aVless than three degrees above absolute zero.
p92
aVAnd it's very empty.
p93
aVThe vacuum there is one million times less dense than the highest vacuum
p94
aVthat our best technology on Earth can currently create.
p95
aVSo that's how different a typical place is from this place.
p96
aVAnd that is how un-typical this place is.
p97
aVSo can we have the lights back on please? Thank you.
p98
aa(lp99
VNow, how do we know about an environment that's so far away and so different
p100
aVand so alien from anything we're used to?
p101
aVWell, the Earth \u2014 our environment, in the form of us \u2014
p102
aVis creating knowledge.
p103
aVWell, what does that mean?
p104
aVWell, look out even further than we've just been \u2014
p105
aVI mean from here, with a telescope \u2014
p106
aVand you'll see things that look like stars, they're called quasars.
p107
aV"Quasars" originally meant "quasi-stellar object,"
p108
aVwhich means "things that look a bit like stars."
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VBut they're not stars.
p113
aVAnd we know what they are.
p114
aVBillions of years ago and billions of light-years away,
p115
aVthe material at the center of a galaxy collapsed
p116
aVtowards a super-massive black hole.
p117
aVAnd then intense magnetic fields
p118
aVdirected some of the energy of that gravitational collapse
p119
aVand some of the matter
p120
aVback out in the form of tremendous jets,
p121
aVwhich illuminated lobes
p122
aVwith the brilliance of \u2014 I think it's a trillion \u2014 suns.
p123
aa(lp124
VNow, the physics of the human brain could hardly be more unlike
p125
aVthe physics of such a jet.
p126
aVWe couldn't survive for an instant in it.
p127
aVLanguage breaks down when trying to describe
p128
aVwhat it would be like in one of those jets.
p129
aVIt would be a bit like experiencing a supernova explosion,
p130
aVbut at point-blank range and for millions of years at a time.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd yet, that jet happened in precisely such a way
p135
aVthat billions of years later, on the other side of the universe,
p136
aVsome bit of chemical scum could accurately describe
p137
aVand model and predict and explain, above all \u2014
p138
aVthere's your reference \u2014
p139
aVwhat was happening there, in reality.
p140
aVThe one physical system, the brain, contains an accurate working model
p141
aVof the other, the quasar.
p142
aVNot just a superficial image of it, though it contains that as well,
p143
aVbut an explanatory model,
p144
aVembodying the same mathematical relationships
p145
aVand the same causal structure.
p146
aa(lp147
VNow, that is knowledge.
p148
aVAnd if that weren't amazing enough,
p149
aVthe faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other
p150
aVis increasing with time.
p151
aVThat is the growth of knowledge.
p152
aVSo, the laws of physics have this special property,
p153
aVthat physical objects as unlike each other as they could possibly be,
p154
aVcan nevertheless embody the same mathematical and causal structure
p155
aVand to do it more and more so over time.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo we are a chemical scum that is different.
p158
aVThis chemical scum has universality.
p159
aVIts structure contains, with ever-increasing precision,
p160
aVthe structure of everything.
p161
aVThis place, and not other places in the universe,
p162
aVis a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essence
p163
aVof the whole of the rest of physical reality.
p164
aVAnd so, far from being insignificant,
p165
aVthe fact that the laws of physics allow this
p166
aVor even mandate that this can happen,
p167
aVis one of the most important things about the physical world.
p168
aa(lp169
VNow how does the solar system \u2014 our environment, in the form of us \u2014
p170
aVacquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe?
p171
aVWell, one thing that's true about Stephen Hawking's remark \u2014
p172
aVI mean, it is true, but it's the wrong emphasis.
p173
aVOne thing that's true about it is that it doesn't do it with any special physics,
p174
aVthere's no special dispensation, no miracles involved.
p175
aVIt does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance.
p176
aVOne of them is matter,
p177
aVbecause the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing.
p178
aVInformation processing is computation, computation requires a computer \u2014
p179
aVthere's no known way of making a computer without matter.
p180
aVWe also need energy to make the computer, and most important,
p181
aVto make the media, in effect, onto which we record
p182
aVthe knowledge that we discover.
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd then thirdly, less tangible but just as essential
p185
aVfor the open-ended creation of knowledge, of explanations,
p186
aVis evidence.
p187
aVNow, our environment is inundated with evidence.
p188
aVWe happen to get round to testing, let's say, Newton's Law of Gravity,
p189
aVabout 300 years ago.
p190
aVBut the evidence that we used to do that
p191
aVwas falling down on every square meter of the Earth
p192
aVfor billions of years before that,
p193
aVand will continue to fall for billions of years afterwards.
p194
aVAnd the same is true for all the other sciences.
p195
aVAs far as we know, evidence to discover the most fundamental truths
p196
aVof all the sciences is here just for the taking, on our planet.
p197
aa(lp198
VOur location is saturated with evidence
p199
aVand also with matter and energy.
p200
aVOut in intergalactic space,
p201
aVthose three prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge
p202
aVare at their lowest possible supply \u2014
p203
aVas I said, it's empty, it's cold and it's dark out there.
p204
aVOr is it?
p205
aVNow actually, that's just another parochial misconception.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VBecause imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space,
p210
aVthe same size as our home, the solar system.
p211
aVNow that cube is very empty by human standards,
p212
aVbut that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter.
p213
aVAnd a million tons is enough to make, say, a self-contained space station,
p214
aVon which there's a colony of scientists
p215
aVthat are devoted to creating an open-ended stream of knowledge, and so on.
p216
aa(lp217
VNow, it's way beyond present technology
p218
aVto even gather the hydrogen from intergalactic space
p219
aVand form it into other elements and so on.
p220
aVBut the thing is, in a comprehensible universe,
p221
aVif something isn't forbidden by the laws of physics,
p222
aVthen what could possibly prevent us from doing it, other than knowing how?
p223
aVIn other words, it's a matter of knowledge, not resources.
p224
aVIf we could do that, we'd automatically have an energy supply,
p225
aVbecause this transmutation would be a fusion reactor.
p226
aa(lp227
VAnd evidence?
p228
aVWell, again, it's dark out there to human senses,
p229
aVbut all you've got to do is take a telescope,
p230
aVeven one of present-day design,
p231
aVlook out, and you'll see the same galaxies as we do from here.
p232
aVAnd with a more powerful telescope,
p233
aVyou'll be able to see stars and planets in those galaxies,
p234
aVyou'll be able to do astrophysics and learn the laws of physics.
p235
aVAnd locally there you could build particle accelerators,
p236
aVand learn elementary particle physics and chemistry, and so on.
p237
aVProbably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips \u2014
p238
aa(lp239
V(Laughter)
p240
aa(lp241
Vbecause it would take several hundred million years
p242
aVto get to the nearest life-bearing planet and back.
p243
aVBut I have to tell you \u2014 and sorry, Richard \u2014
p244
aVbut I never did like biology field trips much,
p245
aa(lp246
V(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
Vand I think we can just about make do
p249
aVwith one every few hundred million years.
p250
aa(lp251
V(Laughter)
p252
aa(lp253
VSo in fact, intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisites
p254
aVfor the open-ended creation of knowledge.
p255
aVAny such cube anywhere in the universe
p256
aVcould become the same kind of hub that we are,
p257
aVif the knowledge of how to do so were present there.
p258
aVSo, we're not in a uniquely hospitable place.
p259
aVIf intergalactic space is capable of creating
p260
aVan open-ended stream of explanations,
p261
aVthen so is almost every other environment,
p262
aVso is the Earth.
p263
aVSo is a polluted Earth.
p264
aVAnd the limiting factor, there and here,
p265
aVis not resources, because they're plentiful,
p266
aVbut knowledge, which is scarce.
p267
aa(lp268
VNow this cosmic knowledge-based view may \u2014 and I think ought to \u2014
p269
aVmake us feel very special.
p270
aVBut it should also make us feel vulnerable,
p271
aVbecause it means that without the specific knowledge
p272
aVthat's needed to survive the ongoing challenges of the universe,
p273
aVwe won't survive them.
p274
aVAll it takes is for a supernova to go off a few light-years away,
p275
aVand we'll all be dead!
p276
aa(lp277
VMartin Rees has recently written a book
p278
aVabout our vulnerability to all sorts of things,
p279
aVfrom astrophysics, to scientific experiments gone wrong,
p280
aVand most importantly, to terrorism with weapons of mass destruction.
p281
aVAnd he thinks that civilization has only a 50 percent chance
p282
aVof surviving this century.
p283
aVI think he's going to talk about that later in the conference.
p284
aa(lp285
VNow, I don't think that probability is the right category
p286
aVto discuss this issue in,
p287
aVbut I do agree with him about this:
p288
aVWe can survive and we can fail to survive.
p289
aVBut it depends not on chance,
p290
aVbut on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time.
p291
aVThe danger is not at all unprecedented.
p292
aVSpecies go extinct all the time.
p293
aVCivilizations end.
p294
aVThe overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations
p295
aVthat have ever existed are now history.
p296
aVAnd if we want to be the exception to that,
p297
aVthen logically, our only hope is to make use of the one feature
p298
aVthat distinguishes our species and civilization from all the others \u2014
p299
aVnamely, our special relationship with the laws of physics,
p300
aVour ability to create new explanations, new knowledge \u2014
p301
aVto be a hub of existence.
p302
aa(lp303
VSo let me now apply this to a current controversy,
p304
aVnot because I want to advocate any particular solution,
p305
aVbut just to illustrate the kind of thing I mean.
p306
aVAnd the controversy is global warming.
p307
aVNow, I'm a physicist, but I'm not the right kind of physicist.
p308
aVIn regard to global warming, I'm just a layman.
p309
aVAnd the rational thing for a layman to do
p310
aVis to take seriously the prevailing scientific theory.
p311
aVAnd according to that theory, it's already too late to avoid a disaster,
p312
aVbecause if it's true that our best option at the moment is to prevent CO2 emissions
p313
aVwith something like the Kyoto Protocol,
p314
aVwith its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost
p315
aVof hundreds of billions of dollars, or whatever it is,
p316
aVthen that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure.
p317
aVAnd the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem,
p318
aVmerely to postpone it by a little.
p319
aVSo it's already too late to avoid it,
p320
aVand it probably has been too late to avoid it
p321
aVever since before anyone realized the danger.
p322
aVIt was probably already too late in the 1970s,
p323
aVwhen the best available scientific theory was telling us
p324
aVthat industrial emissions were about to precipitate a new ice age,
p325
aVin which billions would die.
p326
aa(lp327
VNow, the lesson of that seems clear to me,
p328
aVand I don't know why it isn't informing public debate.
p329
aVIt is that we can't always know.
p330
aVWhen we know of an impending disaster,
p331
aVand how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself,
p332
aVthen there's not going to be much argument, really.
p333
aVBut no precautions and no precautionary principle
p334
aVcan avoid problems that we do not yet foresee.
p335
aa(lp336
VHence, we need a stance of problem-fixing,
p337
aVnot just problem-avoidance.
p338
aVAnd it's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure,
p339
aVbut that's only if we know what to prevent.
p340
aVIf you've been punched on the nose,
p341
aVthen the science of medicine does not consist of teaching you
p342
aVhow to avoid punches.
p343
aa(lp344
V(Laughter)
p345
aa(lp346
VIf medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only,
p347
aVthen it would achieve very little of either.
p348
aa(lp349
VThe world is buzzing at the moment
p350
aVwith plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs.
p351
aVIt ought to be buzzing with plans to reduce the temperature,
p352
aVand with plans to live at the higher temperature \u2014
p353
aVand not at all costs, but efficiently and cheaply.
p354
aVAnd some such plans exist,
p355
aVthings like swarms of mirrors in space to deflect the sunlight away,
p356
aVand encouraging aquatic organisms to eat more carbon dioxide.
p357
aVAt the moment, these things are fringe research;
p358
aVthey're not central to the human effort to face this problem,
p359
aVor problems in general.
p360
aVAnd with problems that we are not aware of yet,
p361
aVthe ability to put right \u2014 not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely \u2014
p362
aVis our only hope, not just of solving problems,
p363
aVbut of survival.
p364
aa(lp365
VSo take two stone tablets, and carve on them.
p366
aVOn one of them, carve: "Problems are soluble."
p367
aVAnd on the other one, carve: "Problems are inevitable."
p368
aa(lp369
VThank you.

VWe've got a real problem with math education right now.
p5
aVBasically, no one's very happy.
p6
aVThose learning it
p7
aVthink it's disconnected,
p8
aVuninteresting and hard.
p9
aVThose trying to employ them
p10
aVthink they don't know enough.
p11
aVGovernments realize that it's a big deal for our economies,
p12
aVbut don't know how to fix it.
p13
aVAnd teachers are also frustrated.
p14
aVYet math is more important to the world
p15
aVthan at any point in human history.
p16
aVSo at one end we've got falling interest
p17
aVin education in math,
p18
aVand at the other end we've got a more mathematical world,
p19
aVa more quantitative world than we ever have had.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo what's the problem, why has this chasm opened up,
p22
aVand what can we do to fix it?
p23
aVWell actually, I think the answer
p24
aVis staring us right in the face:
p25
aVUse computers.
p26
aVI believe
p27
aVthat correctly using computers
p28
aVis the silver bullet
p29
aVfor making math education work.
p30
aVSo to explain that,
p31
aVlet me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world
p32
aVand what it looks like in education.
p33
aVSee, in the real world
p34
aVmath isn't necessarily done by mathematicians.
p35
aVIt's done by geologists,
p36
aVengineers, biologists,
p37
aVall sorts of different people \u2014
p38
aVmodeling and simulation.
p39
aVIt's actually very popular.
p40
aVBut in education it looks very different \u2014
p41
aVdumbed-down problems, lots of calculating,
p42
aVmostly by hand.
p43
aVLots of things that seem simple
p44
aVand not difficult like in the real world,
p45
aVexcept if you're learning it.
p46
aVAnd another thing about math:
p47
aVmath sometimes looks like math \u2014
p48
aVlike in this example here \u2014
p49
aVand sometimes it doesn't \u2014
p50
aVlike "Am I drunk?"
p51
aVAnd then you get an answer that's quantitative in the modern world.
p52
aVYou wouldn't have expected that a few years back.
p53
aVBut now you can find out all about \u2014
p54
aVunfortunately, my weight is a little higher than that, but \u2014
p55
aVall about what happens.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo let's zoom out a bit and ask,
p58
aVwhy are we teaching people math?
p59
aVWhat's the point of teaching people math?
p60
aVAnd in particular, why are we teaching them math in general?
p61
aVWhy is it such an important part of education
p62
aVas a sort of compulsory subject?
p63
aVWell, I think there are about three reasons:
p64
aVtechnical jobs
p65
aVso critical to the development of our economies,
p66
aVwhat I call "everyday living" \u2014
p67
aVto function in the world today,
p68
aVyou've got to be pretty quantitative,
p69
aVmuch more so than a few years ago:
p70
aVfigure out your mortgages,
p71
aVbeing skeptical of government statistics, those kinds of things \u2014
p72
aVand thirdly, what I would call something like
p73
aVlogical mind training, logical thinking.
p74
aVOver the years
p75
aVwe've put so much in society
p76
aVinto being able to process and think logically. It's part of human society.
p77
aVIt's very important to learn that
p78
aVmath is a great way to do that.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo let's ask another question.
p81
aVWhat is math?
p82
aVWhat do we mean when we say we're doing math,
p83
aVor educating people to do math?
p84
aVWell, I think it's about four steps, roughly speaking,
p85
aVstarting with posing the right question.
p86
aVWhat is it that we want to ask? What is it we're trying to find out here?
p87
aVAnd this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world,
p88
aVbeyond virtually any other part of doing math.
p89
aVPeople ask the wrong question,
p90
aVand surprisingly enough, they get the wrong answer,
p91
aVfor that reason, if not for others.
p92
aVSo the next thing is take that problem
p93
aVand turn it from a real world problem
p94
aVinto a math problem.
p95
aVThat's stage two.
p96
aVOnce you've done that, then there's the computation step.
p97
aVTurn it from that into some answer
p98
aVin a mathematical form.
p99
aVAnd of course, math is very powerful at doing that.
p100
aVAnd then finally, turn it back to the real world.
p101
aVDid it answer the question?
p102
aVAnd also verify it \u2014 crucial step.
p103
aVNow here's the crazy thing right now.
p104
aVIn math education,
p105
aVwe're spending about perhaps 80 percent of the time
p106
aVteaching people to do step three by hand.
p107
aVYet, that's the one step computers can do
p108
aVbetter than any human after years of practice.
p109
aVInstead, we ought to be using computers
p110
aVto do step three
p111
aVand using the students to spend much more effort
p112
aVon learning how to do steps one, two and four \u2014
p113
aVconceptualizing problems, applying them,
p114
aVgetting the teacher to run them through how to do that.
p115
aa(lp116
VSee, crucial point here:
p117
aVmath is not equal to calculating.
p118
aVMath is a much broader subject than calculating.
p119
aVNow it's understandable that this has all got intertwined
p120
aVover hundreds of years.
p121
aVThere was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand.
p122
aVBut in the last few decades
p123
aVthat has totally changed.
p124
aVWe've had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject
p125
aVthat I could ever imagine with computers.
p126
aVCalculating was typically the limiting step,
p127
aVand now often it isn't.
p128
aVSo I think in terms of the fact that math
p129
aVhas been liberated from calculating.
p130
aVBut that math liberation didn't get into education yet.
p131
aVSee, I think of calculating, in a sense,
p132
aVas the machinery of math.
p133
aVIt's the chore.
p134
aVIt's the thing you'd like to avoid if you can, like to get a machine to do.
p135
aVIt's a means to an end, not an end in itself,
p136
aVand automation allows us
p137
aVto have that machinery.
p138
aVComputers allow us to do that \u2014
p139
aVand this is not a small problem by any means.
p140
aVI estimated that, just today, across the world,
p141
aVwe spent about 106 average world lifetimes
p142
aVteaching people how to calculate by hand.
p143
aVThat's an amazing amount of human endeavor.
p144
aVSo we better be damn sure \u2014
p145
aVand by the way, they didn't even have fun doing it, most of them \u2014
p146
aVso we better be damn sure
p147
aVthat we know why we're doing that
p148
aVand it has a real purpose.
p149
aa(lp150
VI think we should be assuming computers
p151
aVfor doing the calculating
p152
aVand only doing hand calculations where it really makes sense to teach people that.
p153
aVAnd I think there are some cases.
p154
aVFor example: mental arithmetic.
p155
aVI still do a lot of that, mainly for estimating.
p156
aVPeople say, "Is such and such true?"
p157
aVAnd I'll say, "Hmm, not sure." I'll think about it roughly.
p158
aVIt's still quicker to do that and more practical.
p159
aVSo I think practicality is one case
p160
aVwhere it's worth teaching people by hand.
p161
aVAnd then there are certain conceptual things
p162
aVthat can also benefit from hand calculating,
p163
aVbut I think they're relatively small in number.
p164
aVOne thing I often ask about
p165
aVis ancient Greek and how this relates.
p166
aVSee, the thing we're doing right now
p167
aVis we're forcing people to learn mathematics.
p168
aVIt's a major subject.
p169
aVI'm not for one minute suggesting that, if people are interested in hand calculating
p170
aVor in following their own interests
p171
aVin any subject however bizarre \u2014
p172
aVthey should do that.
p173
aVThat's absolutely the right thing,
p174
aVfor people to follow their self-interest.
p175
aVI was somewhat interested in ancient Greek,
p176
aVbut I don't think that we should force the entire population
p177
aVto learn a subject like ancient Greek.
p178
aVI don't think it's warranted.
p179
aVSo I have this distinction between what we're making people do
p180
aVand the subject that's sort of mainstream
p181
aVand the subject that, in a sense, people might follow with their own interest
p182
aVand perhaps even be spiked into doing that.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo what are the issues people bring up with this?
p185
aVWell one of them is, they say, you need to get the basics first.
p186
aVYou shouldn't use the machine
p187
aVuntil you get the basics of the subject.
p188
aVSo my usual question is, what do you mean by "basics?"
p189
aVBasics of what?
p190
aVAre the basics of driving a car
p191
aVlearning how to service it, or design it for that matter?
p192
aVAre the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill?
p193
aVI don't think so.
p194
aVI think you need to separate the basics of what you're trying to do
p195
aVfrom how it gets done
p196
aVand the machinery of how it gets done
p197
aVand automation allows you to make that separation.
p198
aVA hundred years ago, it's certainly true that to drive a car
p199
aVyou kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car
p200
aVand how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things.
p201
aVBut automation in cars
p202
aVallowed that to separate,
p203
aVso driving is now a quite separate subject, so to speak,
p204
aVfrom engineering of the car
p205
aVor learning how to service it.
p206
aVSo automation allows this separation
p207
aVand also allows \u2014 in the case of driving,
p208
aVand I believe also in the future case of maths \u2014
p209
aVa democratized way of doing that.
p210
aVIt can be spread across a much larger number of people
p211
aVwho can really work with that.
p212
aa(lp213
VSo there's another thing that comes up with basics.
p214
aVPeople confuse, in my view,
p215
aVthe order of the invention of the tools
p216
aVwith the order in which they should use them for teaching.
p217
aVSo just because paper was invented before computers,
p218
aVit doesn't necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject
p219
aVby using paper instead of a computer
p220
aVto teach mathematics.
p221
aVMy daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this.
p222
aVShe enjoys making what she calls "paper laptops."
p223
aV(Laughter)
p224
aVSo I asked her one day, "You know, when I was your age,
p225
aVI didn't make these.
p226
aVWhy do you think that was?"
p227
aVAnd after a second or two, carefully reflecting,
p228
aVshe said, "No paper?"
p229
aV(Laughter)
p230
aVIf you were born after computers and paper,
p231
aVit doesn't really matter which order you're taught with them in,
p232
aVyou just want to have the best tool.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo another one that comes up is "Computers dumb math down."
p235
aVThat somehow, if you use a computer,
p236
aVit's all mindless button-pushing,
p237
aVbut if you do it by hand,
p238
aVit's all intellectual.
p239
aVThis one kind of annoys me, I must say.
p240
aVDo we really believe
p241
aVthat the math that most people are doing in school
p242
aVpractically today
p243
aVis more than applying procedures
p244
aVto problems they don't really understand, for reasons they don't get?
p245
aVI don't think so.
p246
aVAnd what's worse, what they're learning there isn't even practically useful anymore.
p247
aVMight have been 50 years ago, but it isn't anymore.
p248
aVWhen they're out of education, they do it on a computer.
p249
aVJust to be clear, I think computers can really help with this problem,
p250
aVactually make it more conceptual.
p251
aVNow, of course, like any great tool,
p252
aVthey can be used completely mindlessly,
p253
aVlike turning everything into a multimedia show,
p254
aVlike the example I was shown of solving an equation by hand,
p255
aVwhere the computer was the teacher \u2014
p256
aVshow the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand.
p257
aVThis is just nuts.
p258
aVWhy are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand
p259
aVthat the computer should be doing anyway?
p260
aVAll backwards.
p261
aa(lp262
VLet me show you
p263
aVthat you can also make problems harder to calculate.
p264
aVSee, normally in school,
p265
aVyou do things like solve quadratic equations.
p266
aVBut you see, when you're using a computer,
p267
aVyou can just substitute.
p268
aVYou can make it a quartic equation. Make it kind of harder, calculating-wise.
p269
aVSame principles applied \u2014
p270
aVcalculations, harder.
p271
aVAnd problems in the real world
p272
aVlook nutty and horrible like this.
p273
aVThey've got hair all over them.
p274
aVThey're not just simple, dumbed-down things that we see in school math.
p275
aVAnd think of the outside world.
p276
aVDo we really believe that engineering and biology
p277
aVand all of these other things
p278
aVthat have so benefited from computers and maths
p279
aVhave somehow conceptually gotten reduced by using computers?
p280
aVI don't think so \u2014 quite the opposite.
p281
aVSo the problem we've really got in math education
p282
aVis not that computers might dumb it down,
p283
aVbut that we have dumbed-down problems right now.
p284
aVWell, another issue people bring up
p285
aVis somehow that hand calculating procedures
p286
aVteach understanding.
p287
aVSo if you go through lots of examples,
p288
aVyou can get the answer,
p289
aVyou can understand how the basics of the system work better.
p290
aVI think there is one thing that I think very valid here,
p291
aVwhich is that I think understanding procedures and processes is important.
p292
aVBut there's a fantastic way to do that in the modern world.
p293
aVIt's called programming.
p294
aa(lp295
VProgramming is how most procedures and processes
p296
aVget written down these days,
p297
aVand it's also a great way
p298
aVto engage students much more
p299
aVand to check they really understand.
p300
aVIf you really want to check you understand math
p301
aVthen write a program to do it.
p302
aVSo programming is the way I think we should be doing that.
p303
aVSo to be clear, what I really am suggesting here
p304
aVis we have a unique opportunity
p305
aVto make maths both more practical
p306
aVand more conceptual, simultaneously.
p307
aVI can't think of any other subject where that's recently been possible.
p308
aVIt's usually some kind of choice
p309
aVbetween the vocational and the intellectual.
p310
aVBut I think we can do both at the same time here.
p311
aVAnd we open up so many more possibilities.
p312
aVYou can do so many more problems.
p313
aVWhat I really think we gain from this
p314
aVis students getting intuition and experience
p315
aVin far greater quantities than they've ever got before.
p316
aVAnd experience of harder problems \u2014
p317
aVbeing able to play with the math, interact with it,
p318
aVfeel it.
p319
aVWe want people who can feel the math instinctively.
p320
aVThat's what computers allow us to do.
p321
aa(lp322
VAnother thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum.
p323
aVTraditionally it's been by how difficult it is to calculate,
p324
aVbut now we can reorder it
p325
aVby how difficult it is to understand the concepts,
p326
aVhowever hard the calculating.
p327
aVSo calculus has traditionally been taught very late.
p328
aVWhy is this?
p329
aVWell, it's damn hard doing the calculations, that's the problem.
p330
aVBut actually many of the concepts
p331
aVare amenable to a much younger age group.
p332
aVThis was an example I built for my daughter.
p333
aVAnd very, very simple.
p334
aVWe were talking about what happens
p335
aVwhen you increase the number of sides of a polygon
p336
aVto a very large number.
p337
aVAnd of course, it turns into a circle.
p338
aVAnd by the way, she was also very insistent
p339
aVon being able to change the color,
p340
aVan important feature for this demonstration.
p341
aVYou can see that this is a very early step
p342
aVinto limits and differential calculus
p343
aVand what happens when you take things to an extreme \u2014
p344
aVand very small sides and a very large number of sides.
p345
aVVery simple example.
p346
aVThat's a view of the world
p347
aVthat we don't usually give people for many, many years after this.
p348
aVAnd yet, that's a really important practical view of the world.
p349
aVSo one of the roadblocks we have
p350
aVin moving this agenda forward
p351
aVis exams.
p352
aVIn the end, if we test everyone by hand in exams,
p353
aVit's kind of hard to get the curricula changed
p354
aVto a point where they can use computers
p355
aVduring the semesters.
p356
aa(lp357
VAnd one of the reasons it's so important \u2014
p358
aVso it's very important to get computers in exams.
p359
aVAnd then we can ask questions, real questions,
p360
aVquestions like, what's the best life insurance policy to get? \u2014
p361
aVreal questions that people have in their everyday lives.
p362
aVAnd you see, this isn't some dumbed-down model here.
p363
aVThis is an actual model where we can be asked to optimize what happens.
p364
aVHow many years of protection do I need?
p365
aVWhat does that do to the payments
p366
aVand to the interest rates and so forth?
p367
aVNow I'm not for one minute suggesting it's the only kind of question
p368
aVthat should be asked in exams,
p369
aVbut I think it's a very important type
p370
aVthat right now just gets completely ignored
p371
aVand is critical for people's real understanding.
p372
aa(lp373
VSo I believe [there is] critical reform
p374
aVwe have to do in computer-based math.
p375
aVWe have got to make sure
p376
aVthat we can move our economies forward,
p377
aVand also our societies,
p378
aVbased on the idea that people can really feel mathematics.
p379
aVThis isn't some optional extra.
p380
aVAnd the country that does this first
p381
aVwill, in my view, leapfrog others
p382
aVin achieving a new economy even,
p383
aVan improved economy,
p384
aVan improved outlook.
p385
aVIn fact, I even talk about us moving
p386
aVfrom what we often call now the "knowledge economy"
p387
aVto what we might call a "computational knowledge economy,"
p388
aVwhere high-level math is integral to what everyone does
p389
aVin the way that knowledge currently is.
p390
aVWe can engage so many more students with this,
p391
aVand they can have a better time doing it.
p392
aVAnd let's understand:
p393
aVthis is not an incremental sort of change.
p394
aVWe're trying to cross the chasm here
p395
aVbetween school math and the real-world math.
p396
aVAnd you know if you walk across a chasm,
p397
aVyou end up making it worse than if you didn't start at all \u2014
p398
aVbigger disaster.
p399
aVNo, what I'm suggesting
p400
aVis that we should leap off,
p401
aVwe should increase our velocity
p402
aVso it's high,
p403
aVand we should leap off one side and go the other \u2014
p404
aVof course, having calculated our differential equation very carefully.
p405
aa(lp406
V(Laughter)
p407
aa(lp408
VSo I want to see
p409
aVa completely renewed, changed math curriculum
p410
aVbuilt from the ground up,
p411
aVbased on computers being there,
p412
aVcomputers that are now ubiquitous almost.
p413
aVCalculating machines are everywhere
p414
aVand will be completely everywhere in a small number of years.
p415
aVNow I'm not even sure if we should brand the subject as math,
p416
aVbut what I am sure is
p417
aVit's the mainstream subject of the future.
p418
aVLet's go for it,
p419
aVand while we're about it,
p420
aVlet's have a bit of fun,
p421
aVfor us, for the students and for TED here.
p422
aa(lp423
VThanks.

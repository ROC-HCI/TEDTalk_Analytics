VI need to make a confession at the outset here.
p5
aVA little over 20 years ago, I did something that I regret,
p6
aVsomething that I'm not particularly proud of.
p7
aVSomething that, in many ways, I wish no one would ever know,
p8
aVbut here I feel kind of obliged to reveal.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VIn the late 1980s,
p13
aVin a moment of youthful indiscretion,
p14
aVI went to law school.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VIn America, law is a professional degree:
p19
aVafter your university degree, you go on to law school.
p20
aVWhen I got to law school,
p21
aVI didn't do very well.
p22
aVTo put it mildly, I didn't do very well.
p23
aVI, in fact, graduated in the part of my law school class
p24
aVthat made the top 90% possible.
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VThank you.
p29
aVI never practiced law a day in my life;
p30
aVI pretty much wasn't allowed to.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VBut today, against my better judgment,
p35
aVagainst the advice of my own wife,
p36
aVI want to try to dust off some of those legal skills \u2014
p37
aVwhat's left of those legal skills.
p38
aVI don't want to tell you a story.
p39
aVI want to make a case.
p40
aVI want to make a hard-headed,
p41
aVevidence-based,
p42
aVdare I say lawyerly case,
p43
aVfor rethinking how we run our businesses.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
p46
aVtake a look at this.
p47
aVThis is called the candle problem.
p48
aVSome of you might know it.
p49
aVIt's created in 1945
p50
aVby a psychologist named Karl Duncker.
p51
aVHe created this experiment
p52
aVthat is used in many other experiments in behavioral science.
p53
aVAnd here's how it works. Suppose I'm the experimenter.
p54
aVI bring you into a room.
p55
aVI give you a candle, some thumbtacks and some matches.
p56
aVAnd I say to you,
p57
aV"Your job is to attach the candle to the wall
p58
aVso the wax doesn't drip onto the table."
p59
aVNow what would you do?
p60
aa(lp61
VMany people begin trying to thumbtack the candle to the wall.
p62
aVDoesn't work.
p63
aVI saw somebody kind of make the motion over here \u2014
p64
aVsome people have a great idea where they light the match,
p65
aVmelt the side of the candle, try to adhere it to the wall.
p66
aVIt's an awesome idea. Doesn't work.
p67
aVAnd eventually, after five or ten minutes,
p68
aVmost people figure out the solution,
p69
aVwhich you can see here.
p70
aa(lp71
VThe key is to overcome what's called functional fixedness.
p72
aVYou look at that box and you see it only as a receptacle for the tacks.
p73
aVBut it can also have this other function,
p74
aVas a platform for the candle.
p75
aVThe candle problem.
p76
aa(lp77
VI want to tell you about an experiment using the candle problem,
p78
aVdone by a scientist named Sam Glucksberg,
p79
aVwho is now at Princeton University, US,
p80
aVThis shows the power of incentives.
p81
aa(lp82
VHe gathered his participants and said:
p83
aV"I'm going to time you, how quickly you can solve this problem."
p84
aVTo one group he said,
p85
aV"I'm going to time you to establish norms,
p86
aVaverages for how long it typically takes someone to solve this sort of problem."
p87
aa(lp88
VTo the second group he offered rewards.
p89
aVHe said, "If you're in the top 25% of the fastest times,
p90
aVyou get five dollars.
p91
aVIf you're the fastest of everyone we're testing here today,
p92
aVyou get 20 dollars."
p93
aVNow this is several years ago, adjusted for inflation,
p94
aVit's a decent sum of money for a few minutes of work.
p95
aVIt's a nice motivator.
p96
aa(lp97
VQuestion:
p98
aVHow much faster did this group solve the problem?
p99
aa(lp100
VAnswer:
p101
aVIt took them, on average, three and a half minutes longer.
p102
aV3.5 min longer.
p103
aVThis makes no sense, right?
p104
aVI mean, I'm an American. I believe in free markets.
p105
aVThat's not how it's supposed to work, right?
p106
aa(lp107
V(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VIf you want people to perform better, you reward them. Right?
p110
aVBonuses, commissions, their own reality show.
p111
aVIncentivize them.
p112
aVThat's how business works.
p113
aVBut that's not happening here.
p114
aVYou've got an incentive designed
p115
aVto sharpen thinking and accelerate creativity,
p116
aVand it does just the opposite.
p117
aVIt dulls thinking and blocks creativity.
p118
aa(lp119
VWhat's interesting about this experiment
p120
aVis that it's not an aberration.
p121
aVThis has been replicated over and over again
p122
aVfor nearly 40 years.
p123
aVThese contingent motivators \u2014
p124
aVif you do this, then you get that \u2014
p125
aVwork in some circumstances.
p126
aVBut for a lot of tasks, they actually either don't work
p127
aVor, often, they do harm.
p128
aVThis is one of the most robust findings in social science,
p129
aVand also one of the most ignored.
p130
aa(lp131
VI spent the last couple of years
p132
aVlooking at the science of human motivation,
p133
aVparticularly the dynamics of extrinsic motivators
p134
aVand intrinsic motivators.
p135
aVAnd I'm telling you, it's not even close.
p136
aVIf you look at the science, there is a mismatch
p137
aVbetween what science knows
p138
aVand what business does.
p139
aa(lp140
VWhat's alarming here is that our business operating system \u2014
p141
aVthink of the set of assumptions and protocols beneath our businesses,
p142
aVhow we motivate people, how we apply our human resources\u2014
p143
aVit's built entirely around these extrinsic motivators,
p144
aVaround carrots and sticks.
p145
aVThat's actually fine for many kinds of 20th century tasks.
p146
aVBut for 21st century tasks,
p147
aVthat mechanistic, reward-and-punishment approach
p148
aVdoesn't work,
p149
aVoften doesn't work,
p150
aVand often does harm.
p151
aVLet me show you.
p152
aa(lp153
VGlucksberg did another similar experiment,
p154
aVhe presented the problem in a slightly different way,
p155
aVlike this up here.
p156
aVAttach the candle to the wall so the wax doesn't drip onto the table.
p157
aVSame deal. You: we're timing for norms.
p158
aVYou: we're incentivizing.
p159
aa(lp160
VWhat happened this time?
p161
aVThis time, the incentivized group kicked the other group's butt.
p162
aVWhy?
p163
aVBecause when the tacks are out of the box,
p164
aVit's pretty easy isn't it?
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VIf-then rewards work really well for those sorts of tasks,
p169
aVwhere there is a simple set of rules
p170
aVand a clear destination to go to.
p171
aVRewards, by their very nature,
p172
aVnarrow our focus, concentrate the mind;
p173
aVthat's why they work in so many cases.
p174
aVSo, for tasks like this,
p175
aVa narrow focus, where you just see the goal right there,
p176
aVzoom straight ahead to it,
p177
aVthey work really well.
p178
aa(lp179
VBut for the real candle problem,
p180
aVyou don't want to be looking like this.
p181
aVThe solution is on the periphery. You want to be looking around.
p182
aVThat reward actually narrows our focus
p183
aVand restricts our possibility.
p184
aa(lp185
VLet me tell you why this is so important.
p186
aVIn western Europe,
p187
aVin many parts of Asia,
p188
aVin North America, in Australia,
p189
aVwhite-collar workers are doing less of this kind of work,
p190
aVand more of this kind of work.
p191
aVThat routine, rule-based, left-brain work \u2014
p192
aVcertain kinds of accounting, financial analysis,
p193
aVcomputer programming \u2014
p194
aVhas become fairly easy to outsource,
p195
aVfairly easy to automate.
p196
aVSoftware can do it faster.
p197
aVLow-cost providers can do it cheaper.
p198
aVSo what really matters
p199
aVare the more right-brained creative, conceptual kinds of abilities.
p200
aa(lp201
VThink about your own work.
p202
aVThink about your own work.
p203
aVAre the problems that you face,
p204
aVor even the problems we've been talking about here,
p205
aVdo they have a clear set of rules,
p206
aVand a single solution?
p207
aVNo. The rules are mystifying.
p208
aVThe solution, if it exists at all,
p209
aVis surprising and not obvious.
p210
aVEverybody in this room
p211
aVis dealing with their own version of the candle problem.
p212
aVAnd for candle problems of any kind,
p213
aVin any field,
p214
aVthose if-then rewards,
p215
aVthe things around which we've built so many of our businesses,
p216
aVdon't work!
p217
aa(lp218
VIt makes me crazy.
p219
aVAnd here's the thing.
p220
aVThis is not a feeling.
p221
aVOkay? I'm a lawyer; I don't believe in feelings.
p222
aVThis is not a philosophy.
p223
aVI'm an American; I don't believe in philosophy.
p224
aa(lp225
V(Laughter)
p226
aa(lp227
VThis is a fact \u2014
p228
aVor, as we say in my hometown of Washington, D.C.,
p229
aVa true fact.
p230
aa(lp231
V(Laughter)
p232
aa(lp233
V(Applause)
p234
aa(lp235
VLet me give you an example.
p236
aVLet me marshal the evidence here.
p237
aVI'm not telling a story, I'm making a case.
p238
aVLadies and gentlemen of the jury, some evidence:
p239
aVDan Ariely, one of the great economists of our time,
p240
aVhe and three colleagues did a study of some MIT students.
p241
aVThey gave these MIT students a bunch of games,
p242
aVgames that involved creativity,
p243
aVand motor skills, and concentration.
p244
aVAnd the offered them, for performance,
p245
aVthree levels of rewards:
p246
aVsmall reward, medium reward, large reward.
p247
aVIf you do really well you get the large reward, on down.
p248
aa(lp249
VWhat happened?
p250
aVAs long as the task involved only mechanical skill
p251
aVbonuses worked as they would be expected:
p252
aVthe higher the pay, the better the performance.
p253
aVOkay?
p254
aVBut once the task called for even rudimentary cognitive skill,
p255
aVa larger reward led to poorer performance.
p256
aa(lp257
VThen they said,
p258
aV"Let's see if there's any cultural bias here.
p259
aVLet's go to Madurai, India and test it."
p260
aVStandard of living is lower.
p261
aVIn Madurai, a reward that is modest in North American standards,
p262
aVis more meaningful there.
p263
aVSame deal. A bunch of games, three levels of rewards.
p264
aa(lp265
VWhat happens?
p266
aVPeople offered the medium level of rewards
p267
aVdid no better than people offered the small rewards.
p268
aVBut this time, people offered the highest rewards,
p269
aVthey did the worst of all.
p270
aVIn eight of the nine tasks we examined across three experiments,
p271
aVhigher incentives led to worse performance.
p272
aa(lp273
VIs this some kind of touchy-feely socialist conspiracy going on here?
p274
aVNo, these are economists from MIT,
p275
aVfrom Carnegie Mellon, from the University of Chicago.
p276
aVDo you know who sponsored this research?
p277
aVThe Federal Reserve Bank of the United States.
p278
aVThat's the American experience.
p279
aa(lp280
VLet's go across the pond to the London School of Economics,
p281
aVLSE, London School of Economics,
p282
aValma mater of eleven Nobel Laureates in economics.
p283
aVTraining ground for great economic thinkers
p284
aVlike George Soros, and Friedrich Hayek,
p285
aVand Mick Jagger.
p286
aa(lp287
V(Laughter)
p288
aa(lp289
VLast month,
p290
aVjust last month,
p291
aVeconomists at LSE looked at 51 studies
p292
aVof pay-for-performance plans, inside of companies.
p293
aVHere's what they said:
p294
aV"We find that financial incentives
p295
aVcan result in a negative impact on overall performance."
p296
aa(lp297
VThere is a mismatch between what science knows
p298
aVand what business does.
p299
aVAnd what worries me, as we stand here in the rubble
p300
aVof the economic collapse,
p301
aVis that too many organizations are making their decisions,
p302
aVtheir policies about talent and people,
p303
aVbased on assumptions that are outdated,
p304
aVunexamined,
p305
aVand rooted more in folklore than in science.
p306
aVAnd if we really want to get out of this economic mess,
p307
aVif we really want high performance
p308
aVon those definitional tasks of the 21st century,
p309
aVthe solution is not to do more of the wrong things,
p310
aVto entice people with a sweeter carrot,
p311
aVor threaten them with a sharper stick.
p312
aVWe need a whole new approach.
p313
aa(lp314
VThe good news is that the scientists
p315
aVwho've been studying motivation have given us this new approach.
p316
aVIt's built much more around intrinsic motivation.
p317
aVAround the desire to do things because they matter,
p318
aVbecause we like it, they're interesting, or part of something important.
p319
aVAnd to my mind, that new operating system for our businesses
p320
aVrevolves around three elements:
p321
aVautonomy, mastery and purpose.
p322
aVAutonomy: the urge to direct our own lives.
p323
aVMastery: the desire to get better and better at something that matters.
p324
aVPurpose: the yearning to do what we do
p325
aVin the service of something larger than ourselves.
p326
aVThese are the building blocks of an entirely new operating system
p327
aVfor our businesses.
p328
aa(lp329
VI want to talk today only about autonomy.
p330
aVIn the 20th century, we came up with this idea of management.
p331
aVManagement did not emanate from nature.
p332
aVManagement is not a tree, it's a television set.
p333
aVSomebody invented it.
p334
aVIt doesn't mean it's going to work forever.
p335
aVManagement is great.
p336
aVTraditional notions of management are great
p337
aVif you want compliance.
p338
aVBut if you want engagement, self-direction works better.
p339
aa(lp340
VSome examples of some kind of radical notions of self-direction.
p341
aVYou don't see a lot of it,
p342
aVbut you see the first stirrings of something really interesting going on,
p343
aVwhat it means is paying people adequately and fairly, absolutely \u2014
p344
aVgetting the issue of money off the table,
p345
aVand then giving people lots of autonomy.
p346
aa(lp347
VSome examples.
p348
aVHow many of you have heard of the company Atlassian?
p349
aVIt looks like less than half.
p350
aa(lp351
V(Laughter)
p352
aa(lp353
VAtlassian is an Australian software company.
p354
aVAnd they do something incredibly cool.
p355
aVA few times a year they tell their engineers,
p356
aV"Go for the next 24 hours and work on anything you want,
p357
aVas long as it's not part of your regular job.
p358
aVWork on anything you want."
p359
aVEngineers use this time to come up with a cool patch for code,
p360
aVcome up with an elegant hack.
p361
aVThen they present all of the stuff that they've developed
p362
aVto their teammates, to the rest of the company,
p363
aVin this wild and woolly all-hands meeting at the end of the day.
p364
aVBeing Australians, everybody has a beer.
p365
aa(lp366
VThey call them FedEx Days.
p367
aVWhy?
p368
aVBecause you have to deliver something overnight.
p369
aVIt's pretty; not bad.
p370
aVIt's a huge trademark violation, but it's pretty clever.
p371
aa(lp372
V(Laughter)
p373
aa(lp374
VThat one day of intense autonomy
p375
aVhas produced a whole array of software fixes
p376
aVthat might never have existed.
p377
aa(lp378
VIt's worked so well that Atlassian has taken it to the next level
p379
aVwith 20% time \u2014
p380
aVdone, famously, at Google \u2014
p381
aVwhere engineers can spend 20% of their time
p382
aVworking on anything they want.
p383
aVThey have autonomy over their time,
p384
aVtheir task, their team, their technique.
p385
aVRadical amounts of autonomy.
p386
aVAnd at Google, as many of you know,
p387
aVabout half of the new products in a typical year
p388
aVare birthed during that 20% time:
p389
aVthings like Gmail, Orkut, Google News.
p390
aa(lp391
VLet me give you an even more radical example of it:
p392
aVsomething called the Results Only Work Environment (the ROWE),
p393
aVcreated by two American consultants,
p394
aVin place at a dozen companies around North America.
p395
aVIn a ROWE people don't have schedules.
p396
aVThey show up when they want.
p397
aVThey don't have to be in the office at a certain time, or any time.
p398
aVThey just have to get their work done.
p399
aVHow they do it, when they do it, where they do it, is totally up to them.
p400
aVMeetings in these kinds of environments are optional.
p401
aa(lp402
VWhat happens?
p403
aVAlmost across the board,
p404
aVproductivity goes up, worker engagement goes up,
p405
aVworker satisfaction goes up, turnover goes down.
p406
aVAutonomy, mastery and purpose,
p407
aVthe building blocks of a new way of doing things.
p408
aa(lp409
VSome of you might look at this and say,
p410
aV"Hmm, that sounds nice, but it's Utopian."
p411
aVAnd I say, "Nope.
p412
aVI have proof."
p413
aVThe mid-1990s, Microsoft started an encyclopedia called Encarta.
p414
aVThey had deployed all the right incentives,
p415
aVThey paid professionals to write and edit thousands of articles.
p416
aVWell-compensated managers oversaw the whole thing
p417
aVto make sure it came in on budget and on time.
p418
aVA few years later, another encyclopedia got started.
p419
aVDifferent model, right?
p420
aVDo it for fun.
p421
aVNo one gets paid a cent, or a euro or a yen.
p422
aVDo it because you like to do it.
p423
aa(lp424
VJust 10 years ago,
p425
aVif you had gone to an economist, anywhere,
p426
aV"Hey, I've got these two different models for creating an encyclopedia.
p427
aVIf they went head to head, who would win?"
p428
aV10 years ago you could not have found a single sober economist
p429
aVanywhere on planet Earth
p430
aVwho would have predicted the Wikipedia model.
p431
aa(lp432
VThis is the titanic battle between these two approaches.
p433
aVThis is the Ali-Frazier of motivation, right?
p434
aVThis is the Thrilla in Manila.
p435
aVIntrinsic motivators versus extrinsic motivators.
p436
aVAutonomy, mastery and purpose,
p437
aVversus carrot and sticks, and who wins?
p438
aVIntrinsic motivation, autonomy, mastery and purpose, in a knockout.
p439
aa(lp440
VLet me wrap up.
p441
aVThere is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does.
p442
aVHere is what science knows.
p443
aVOne: Those 20th century rewards,
p444
aVthose motivators we think are a natural part of business,
p445
aVdo work, but only in a surprisingly narrow band of circumstances.
p446
aVTwo: Those if-then rewards often destroy creativity.
p447
aVThree: The secret to high performance isn't rewards and punishments,
p448
aVbut that unseen intrinsic drive\u2014
p449
aVthe drive to do things for their own sake.
p450
aVThe drive to do things cause they matter.
p451
aa(lp452
VAnd here's the best part.
p453
aVWe already know this.
p454
aVThe science confirms what we know in our hearts.
p455
aVSo, if we repair this mismatch between science and business,
p456
aVif we bring our motivation, notions of motivation
p457
aVinto the 21st century,
p458
aVif we get past this lazy, dangerous, ideology
p459
aVof carrots and sticks,
p460
aVwe can strengthen our businesses,
p461
aVwe can solve a lot of those candle problems,
p462
aVand maybe, maybe \u2014
p463
aVwe can change the world.
p464
aa(lp465
VI rest my case.

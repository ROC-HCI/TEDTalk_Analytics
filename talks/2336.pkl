VWhen I was only three or four,
p5
aVI fell in love with poetry,
p6
aVwith the rhythms and the music of language;
p7
aVwith the power of metaphor and of imagery,
p8
aVpoetry being the essence of communication \u2014
p9
aVthe discipline, the distillation.
p10
aVAnd all these years later, the poems I'll read today
p11
aVare from my just-finished seventh book of poetry.
p12
aa(lp13
VWell, five years ago, I was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.
p14
aVThough there's no cure yet,
p15
aVadvances in treatment are really impressive.
p16
aVBut you can imagine that I was appalled to learn
p17
aVthat women are largely left out of research trials,
p18
aVdespite gender-specific medical findings having demonstrated
p19
aVthat we are not actually just small men \u2014
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
Vwho happen to have different reproductive systems.
p24
aVGender-specific medicine is good for men, too.
p25
aa(lp26
VBut you bring to a crisis the person you already are,
p27
aVincluding the, yes, momentum that you've learned to invoke
p28
aVthrough passionate caring and through action,
p29
aVboth of which require but also create energy.
p30
aVSo as an activist, I began working with the Parkinson's Disease Foundation \u2014
p31
aVthat's pdf.org \u2014
p32
aVto create a major initiative to put women on the Parkinson's disease map.
p33
aVAnd as a poet, I began working with this subject matter,
p34
aVfinding it tragic, hilarious, sometimes even joyful.
p35
aVI do not feel diminished by Parkinson's;
p36
aVI feel distilled by it,
p37
aVand I actually very much like the woman I'm distilling into.
p38
aa(lp39
V"No Signs of Struggle"
p40
aa(lp41
VGrowing small requires enormity of will:
p42
aVjust sitting still in the doctor's waiting room
p43
aVwatching the future shuffle in and out,
p44
aVwatching it stoop; stare at you
p45
aVwhile you try not to look.
p46
aVRare is an exchange:
p47
aVa smile of brief, wry recognition.
p48
aa(lp49
VYou are the new kid on the block.
p50
aVEveryone here was you once.
p51
aVYou are still learning that growing small requires a largeness of spirit
p52
aVyou can't fit into yet:
p53
aVacceptance of irritating help from those who love you;
p54
aVgiving way and over, but not up.
p55
aa(lp56
VYou've swallowed hard the contents of the "Drink Me" bottle,
p57
aVand felt yourself shrink.
p58
aVNow, familiar furniture looms,
p59
aVfloors tilt, and doorknobs yield only when wrestled round with both hands.
p60
aVIt demands colossal patience, all this growing small:
p61
aVyour diminished sleep at night,
p62
aVyour handwriting, your voice, your height.
p63
aa(lp64
VYou are more the incredible shrinking woman
p65
aVthan the Buddhist mystic, serene, making do with less.
p66
aVLess is not always more.
p67
aVYet in this emptying space, space glimmers,
p68
aVbecoming visible.
p69
aVHere is a place behind the eyes of those accustomed
p70
aVby what some would call diminishment.
p71
aa(lp72
VIt is a place of merciless poetry,
p73
aVa gift of presence previously ignored,
p74
aVdrowned in the daily clutter.
p75
aVHere every gesture needs intention,
p76
aVis alive with consciousness.
p77
aVNothing is automatic.
p78
aa(lp79
VYou can spot it in the provocation of a button,
p80
aVan arm poking at a sleeve,
p81
aVa balancing act at a night-time curb while negotiating the dark.
p82
aVFeats of such modest valor,
p83
aVwho would suspect them to be exercises in an intimate, fierce discipline,
p84
aVa metaphysics of being relentlessly aware?
p85
aa(lp86
VSuch understated power here,
p87
aVin these tottering dancers who exert stupendous effort
p88
aVon tasks most view as insignificant.
p89
aVSuch quiet beauty here, in these,
p90
aVmy soft-voiced, stiff-limbed people;
p91
aVsuch resolve masked by each placid face.
p92
aVThere is immensity required in growing small,
p93
aVso bent on such unbending grace.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Applause)
p96
aa(lp97
VThank you.
p98
aa(lp99
VThis one is called "On Donating My Brain to Science."
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VNot a problem.
p104
aVSkip over all the pages reassuring religious people.
p105
aVAlready a universal donor: kidneys, corneas, liver, lungs,
p106
aVtissue, heart, veins, whatever.
p107
aa(lp108
VOdd that the modest brain never imagined its unique value in research,
p109
aVmaybe saving someone else from what it is they're not quite sure I have.
p110
aVFlattering, that.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo fill in the forms,
p113
aVdrill through the answers,
p114
aVtrill out a blithe spirit.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd slice me, dice me, spread me on your slides.
p117
aVFind what I'm trying to tell you.
p118
aa(lp119
VEarn me, learn me, scan me, squint through your lens.
p120
aVUncover what I'd hint at if I could.
p121
aa(lp122
VBe my guest, do your best, harvest me, track the clues.
p123
aVThis was a good brain while alive.
p124
aVThis was a brain that paid its dues.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo slice me, dice me, smear me on your slides,
p127
aVstain me, explain me, drain me like a cup.
p128
aVShare me, hear me:
p129
aa(lp130
VI want to be used I want to be used
p131
aVI want to be used up.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Applause)
p134
aa(lp135
V(Applause ends)
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd this one's called "The Ghost Light."
p138
aa(lp139
VLit from within is the sole secure way
p140
aVto traverse dark matter.
p141
aVSome life forms \u2014 certain mushrooms, snails, jellyfish, worms \u2014
p142
aVglow bioluminescent,
p143
aVand people as well;
p144
aVwe emit infra-red light from our most lucent selves.
p145
aVOur tragedy is we can't see it.
p146
aa(lp147
VWe see by reflecting.
p148
aVWe need biofluorescence to show our true colors.
p149
aVExternal illumination can distort, though.
p150
aVWhen gravity bends light,
p151
aVhuge galaxy clusters can act as telescopes,
p152
aVelongating background images of star systems to faint arcs \u2014
p153
aVa lensing effect
p154
aVlike viewing distant street lamps through a glass of wine.
p155
aa(lp156
VA glass of wine or two now makes me weave
p157
aVas if acting the drunkard's part;
p158
aVas if, besotted with unrequited love
p159
aVfor the dynamic Turner canvasses spied out by the Hubble,
p160
aVI could lurch down a city street set
p161
aVwithout provoking every pedestrian walk-on stare.
p162
aa(lp163
VStare as long as you need to.
p164
aVIf you think about it, walking, even standing, is illogical \u2014
p165
aVsuch tiny things, feet! \u2014
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
Vespecially when one's body is not al dente anymore.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VBesides, creature of extremes and excess,
p174
aVI've always thought Apollo beautiful but boring,
p175
aVand a bit of a dumb blonde.
p176
aVDionysians don't do balance.
p177
aa(lp178
VBalance, in other words, has never been my strong point.
p179
aVBut I digress.
p180
aVMore and more these days,
p181
aVdigression seems the most direct route through
p182
aVfrom where I've lost or found myself
p183
aVout of place, mind, turn, time.
p184
aa(lp185
VPlace your foot just so, mind how you turn:
p186
aVtoo swift a swivel can bring you down.
p187
aVTake your time ushering the audience out,
p188
aVsaying goodbye to the actors.
p189
aVThe ghost light
p190
aVis what they call the single bulb
p191
aVhanging above the bare stage in an empty theater.
p192
aa(lp193
VIn the empty theater of such a night,
p194
aVwaking to meet no external radiance,
p195
aVthis is the final struggle left to win,
p196
aVthis the sole beacon to beckon the darkness in
p197
aVand let the rest begin,
p198
aVthis the lens through which at last to see both Self and Other
p199
aVarrayed with the bright stain of original sin:
p200
aVlit from within.
p201
aa(lp202
V(Applause)
p203
aa(lp204
VAnd this is the last one.
p205
aa(lp206
V"This Dark Hour"
p207
aa(lp208
VLate summer, 4 A.M.
p209
aVThe rain slows to a stop,
p210
aVdripping still from the broad leaves
p211
aVof blue hostas unseen in the garden's dark.
p212
aVBarefoot, careful on the slick slate slabs,
p213
aVI need no light, I know the way,
p214
aVstoop by the mint bed,
p215
aVscoop a fistful of moist earth,
p216
aVthen grope for a chair,
p217
aVspread a shawl, and sit,
p218
aVbreathing in the wet green August air.
p219
aa(lp220
VThis is the small, still hour
p221
aVbefore the newspaper lands in the vestibule like a grenade,
p222
aVthe phone shrills, the computer screen blinks and glares awake.
p223
aa(lp224
VThere is this hour:
p225
aVpoem in my head, soil in my hand:
p226
aVunnamable fullness.
p227
aVThis hour, when blood of my blood
p228
aVbone of bone, child grown to manhood now \u2014
p229
aVstranger, intimate, not distant but apart \u2014
p230
aVlies safe, off dreaming melodies
p231
aVwhile love sleeps, safe, in his arms.
p232
aa(lp233
VTo have come to this place,
p234
aVlived to this moment:
p235
aVimmeasurable lightness.
p236
aVThe density of black starts to blur umber.
p237
aVTentative, a cardinal's coloratura,
p238
aVthen the mourning dove's elegy.
p239
aVSable glimmers toward grey;
p240
aVobjects emerge, trailing shadows;
p241
aVnight ages toward day.
p242
aVThe city stirs.
p243
aa(lp244
VThere will be other dawns, nights, gaudy noons.
p245
aVLikely, I'll lose my way.
p246
aVThere will be stumbling, falling,
p247
aVcursing the dark.
p248
aVWhatever comes,
p249
aVthere was this hour when nothing mattered,
p250
aVall was unbearably dear.
p251
aa(lp252
VAnd when I'm done with daylights,
p253
aVshould those who loved me grieve too long a while,
p254
aVlet them remember that I had this hour \u2014
p255
aVthis dark, perfect hour \u2014
p256
aVand smile.
p257
aa(lp258
VThank you.

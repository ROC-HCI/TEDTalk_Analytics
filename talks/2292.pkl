VWhen you're a child,
p5
aVanything and everything is possible.
p6
aVThe challenge, so often, is hanging on to that as we grow up.
p7
aVAnd as a four-year-old,
p8
aVI had the opportunity to sail for the first time.
p9
aa(lp10
VI will never forget the excitement as we closed the coast.
p11
aVI will never forget
p12
aVthe feeling of adventure as I climbed on board the boat
p13
aVand stared into her tiny cabin for the first time.
p14
aVBut the most amazing feeling was the feeling of freedom,
p15
aVthe feeling that I felt when we hoisted her sails.
p16
aVAs a four-year-old child,
p17
aVit was the greatest sense of freedom that I could ever imagine.
p18
aVI made my mind up there and then that one day, somehow,
p19
aVI was going to sail around the world.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo I did what I could in my life to get closer to that dream.
p22
aVAge 10, it was saving my school dinner money change.
p23
aVEvery single day for eight years, I had mashed potato and baked beans,
p24
aVwhich cost 4p each, and gravy was free.
p25
aVEvery day I would pile up the change on the top of my money box,
p26
aVand when that pile reached a pound, I would drop it in
p27
aVand cross off one of the 100 squares I'd drawn on a piece of paper.
p28
aVFinally, I bought a tiny dinghy.
p29
aVI spent hours sitting on it in the garden dreaming of my goal.
p30
aVI read every book I could on sailing,
p31
aVand then eventually, having been told by my school
p32
aVI wasn't clever enough to be a vet,
p33
aVleft school age 17 to begin my apprenticeship in sailing.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo imagine how it felt just four years later
p36
aVto be sitting in a boardroom
p37
aVin front of someone who I knew could make that dream come true.
p38
aVI felt like my life depended on that moment,
p39
aVand incredibly, he said yes.
p40
aVAnd I could barely contain my excitement as I sat in that first design meeting
p41
aVdesigning a boat on which I was going to sail
p42
aVsolo nonstop around the world.
p43
aVFrom that first meeting to the finish line of the race,
p44
aVit was everything I'd ever imagined.
p45
aVJust like in my dreams, there were amazing parts and tough parts.
p46
aVWe missed an iceberg by 20 feet.
p47
aVNine times, I climbed to the top of her 90-foot mast.
p48
aVWe were blown on our side in the Southern Ocean.
p49
aVBut the sunsets, the wildlife, and the remoteness
p50
aVwere absolutely breathtaking.
p51
aVAfter three months at sea, age just 24,
p52
aVI finished in second position.
p53
aVI'd loved it, so much so that within six months
p54
aVI decided to go around the world again, but this time not in a race:
p55
aVto try to be the fastest person ever to sail solo nonstop around the world.
p56
aVNow for this, I needed a different craft:
p57
aVbigger, wider, faster, more powerful.
p58
aVJust to give that boat some scale, I could climb inside her mast
p59
aVall the way to the top.
p60
aVSeventy-five foot long, 60 foot wide.
p61
aVI affectionately called her Moby.
p62
aVShe was a multihull.
p63
aVWhen we built her, no one had ever made it solo nonstop
p64
aVaround the world in one, though many had tried,
p65
aVbut whilst we built her, a Frenchman took a boat 25 percent bigger than her
p66
aVand not only did he make it, but he took the record from 93 days
p67
aVright down to 72.
p68
aVThe bar was now much, much higher.
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd these boats were exciting to sail.
p71
aVThis was a training sail off the French coast.
p72
aVThis I know well because I was one of the five crew members on board.
p73
aVFive seconds is all it took from everything being fine
p74
aVto our world going black as the windows were thrust underwater,
p75
aVand that five seconds goes quickly.
p76
aVJust see how far below those guys the sea is.
p77
aVImagine that alone in the Southern Ocean
p78
aVplunged into icy water, thousands of miles away from land.
p79
aa(lp80
VIt was Christmas Day.
p81
aVI was forging into the Southern Ocean underneath Australia.
p82
aVThe conditions were horrendous.
p83
aVI was approaching a part in the ocean
p84
aVwhich was 2,000 miles away from the nearest town.
p85
aVThe nearest land was Antarctica, and the nearest people
p86
aVwould be those manning the European Space Station above me.
p87
aV(Laughter)
p88
aVYou really are in the middle of nowhere.
p89
aVIf you need help,
p90
aVand you're still alive,
p91
aVit takes four days for a ship to get to you
p92
aVand then four days for that ship to get you back to port.
p93
aVNo helicopter can reach you out there,
p94
aVand no plane can land.
p95
aVWe are forging ahead of a huge storm.
p96
aVWithin it, there was 80 knots of wind,
p97
aVwhich was far too much wind for the boat and I to cope with.
p98
aVThe waves were already 40 to 50 feet high,
p99
aVand the spray from the breaking crests
p100
aVwas blown horizontally like snow in a blizzard.
p101
aVIf we didn't sail fast enough, we'd be engulfed by that storm,
p102
aVand either capsized or smashed to pieces.
p103
aVWe were quite literally hanging on for our lives
p104
aVand doing so on a knife edge.
p105
aa(lp106
VThe speed I so desperately needed brought with it danger.
p107
aVWe all know what it's like driving a car 20 miles an hour, 30, 40.
p108
aVIt's not too stressful. We can concentrate.
p109
aVWe can turn on the radio.
p110
aVTake that 50, 60, 70, accelerate through to 80, 90, 100 miles an hour.
p111
aVNow you have white knuckles and you're gripping the steering wheel.
p112
aVNow take that car off road at night
p113
aVand remove the windscreen wipers, the windscreen,
p114
aVthe headlights and the brakes.
p115
aVThat's what it's like in the Southern Ocean.
p116
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p117
aVYou could imagine
p118
aVit would be quite difficult to sleep in that situation,
p119
aVeven as a passenger.
p120
aVBut you're not a passenger.
p121
aVYou're alone on a boat you can barely stand up in,
p122
aVand you have to make every single decision on board.
p123
aVI was absolutely exhausted, physically and mentally.
p124
aVEight sail changes in 12 hours.
p125
aVThe mainsail weighed three times my body weight,
p126
aVand after each change,
p127
aVI would collapse on the floor soaked with sweat
p128
aVwith this freezing Southern Ocean air burning the back of my throat.
p129
aa(lp130
VBut out there, those lowest of the lows
p131
aVare so often contrasted with the highest of the highs.
p132
aVA few days later, we came out of the back of the low.
p133
aVAgainst all odds, we'd been able to drive ahead of the record
p134
aVwithin that depression.
p135
aVThe sky cleared, the rain stopped,
p136
aVand our heartbeat, the monstrous seas around us were transformed
p137
aVinto the most beautiful moonlit mountains.
p138
aa(lp139
VIt's hard to explain, but you enter a different mode when you head out there.
p140
aVYour boat is your entire world,
p141
aVand what you take with you when you leave is all you have.
p142
aVIf I said to you all now, "Go off into Vancouver
p143
aVand find everything you will need for your survival for the next three months,"
p144
aVthat's quite a task.
p145
aVThat's food, fuel, clothes,
p146
aVeven toilet roll and toothpaste.
p147
aVThat's what we do,
p148
aVand when we leave we manage it
p149
aVdown to the last drop of diesel and the last packet of food.
p150
aVNo experience in my life
p151
aVcould have given me a better understanding of the definition of the word "finite."
p152
aVWhat we have out there is all we have.
p153
aVThere is no more.
p154
aa(lp155
VAnd never in my life had I ever translated that definition of finite
p156
aVthat I'd felt on board to anything outside of sailing
p157
aVuntil I stepped off the boat at the finish line having broken that record.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Applause)
p160
aa(lp161
VSuddenly I connected the dots.
p162
aVOur global economy is no different.
p163
aVIt's entirely dependent on finite materials
p164
aVwe only have once in the history of humanity.
p165
aVAnd it was a bit like seeing something you weren't expecting under a stone
p166
aVand having two choices:
p167
aVI either put that stone to one side
p168
aVand learn more about it, or I put that stone back
p169
aVand I carry on with my dream job of sailing around the world.
p170
aa(lp171
VI chose the first.
p172
aVI put it to one side and I began a new journey of learning,
p173
aVspeaking to chief executives, experts, scientists, economists
p174
aVto try to understand just how our global economy works.
p175
aVAnd my curiosity took me to some extraordinary places.
p176
aa(lp177
VThis photo was taken in the burner of a coal-fired power station.
p178
aVI was fascinated by coal, fundamental to our global energy needs,
p179
aVbut also very close to my family.
p180
aVMy great-grandfather was a coal miner,
p181
aVand he spent 50 years of his life underground.
p182
aVThis is a photo of him, and when you see that photo,
p183
aVyou see someone from another era.
p184
aVNo one wears trousers with a waistband quite that high
p185
aVin this day and age. (Laughter)
p186
aVBut yet, that's me with my great-grandfather,
p187
aVand by the way, they are not his real ears. (Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VWe were close. I remember sitting on his knee listening to his mining stories.
p190
aVHe talked of the camaraderie underground,
p191
aVand the fact that the miners used to save the crusts of their sandwiches
p192
aVto give to the ponies they worked with underground.
p193
aVIt was like it was yesterday.
p194
aVAnd on my journey of learning,
p195
aVI went to the World Coal Association website,
p196
aVand there in the middle of the homepage, it said,
p197
aV"We have about 118 years of coal left."
p198
aVAnd I thought to myself, well, that's well outside my lifetime,
p199
aVand a much greater figure than the predictions for oil.
p200
aVBut I did the math, and I realized that my great-grandfather
p201
aVhad been born exactly 118 years before that year,
p202
aVand I sat on his knee until I was 11 years old,
p203
aVand I realized it's nothing
p204
aVin time, nor in history.
p205
aVAnd it made me make a decision I never thought I would make:
p206
aVto leave the sport of solo sailing behind me
p207
aVand focus on the greatest challenge I'd ever come across:
p208
aVthe future of our global economy.
p209
aa(lp210
VAnd I quickly realized it wasn't just about energy.
p211
aVIt was also materials.
p212
aVIn 2008, I picked up a scientific study
p213
aVlooking at how many years we have
p214
aVof valuable materials to extract from the ground:
p215
aVcopper, 61; tin, zinc, 40; silver, 29.
p216
aVThese figures couldn't be exact, but we knew those materials were finite.
p217
aVWe only have them once.
p218
aVAnd yet, our speed that we've used these materials has increased rapidly,
p219
aVexponentially.
p220
aVWith more people in the world with more stuff,
p221
aVwe've effectively seen 100 years of price declines
p222
aVin those basic commodities erased in just 10 years.
p223
aVAnd this affects all of us.
p224
aVIt's brought huge volatility in prices,
p225
aVso much so that in 2011,
p226
aVyour average European car manufacturer
p227
aVsaw a raw material price increase
p228
aVof 500 million Euros,
p229
aVwiping away half their operating profits
p230
aVthrough something they have absolutely no control over.
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd the more I learned, the more I started to change my own life.
p233
aVI started traveling less, doing less, using less.
p234
aVIt felt like actually doing less was what we had to do.
p235
aVBut it sat uneasy with me.
p236
aVIt didn't feel right.
p237
aVIt felt like we were buying ourselves time.
p238
aVWe were eking things out a bit longer.
p239
aVEven if everybody changed, it wouldn't solve the problem.
p240
aVIt wouldn't fix the system.
p241
aVIt was vital in the transition, but what fascinated me was,
p242
aVin the transition to what? What could actually work?
p243
aa(lp244
VIt struck me that the system itself, the framework within which we live,
p245
aVis fundamentally flawed,
p246
aVand I realized ultimately
p247
aVthat our operating system, the way our economy functions,
p248
aVthe way our economy's been built, is a system in itself.
p249
aVAt sea, I had to understand complex systems.
p250
aVI had to take multiple inputs,
p251
aVI had to process them,
p252
aVand I had to understand the system to win.
p253
aVI had to make sense of it.
p254
aVAnd as I looked at our global economy, I realized it too is that system,
p255
aVbut it's a system that effectively can't run in the long term.
p256
aa(lp257
VAnd I realized we've been perfecting what's effectively a linear economy
p258
aVfor 150 years,
p259
aVwhere we take a material out of the ground,
p260
aVwe make something out of it, and then ultimately
p261
aVthat product gets thrown away, and yes, we do recycle some of it,
p262
aVbut more an attempt to get out what we can at the end,
p263
aVnot by design.
p264
aVIt's an economy that fundamentally can't run in the long term,
p265
aVand if we know that we have finite materials,
p266
aVwhy would we build an economy that would effectively use things up,
p267
aVthat would create waste?
p268
aVLife itself has existed for billions of years
p269
aVand has continually adapted to use materials effectively.
p270
aVIt's a complex system, but within it, there is no waste.
p271
aVEverything is metabolized.
p272
aVIt's not a linear economy at all, but circular.
p273
aa(lp274
VAnd I felt like the child in the garden.
p275
aVFor the first time on this new journey, I could see exactly where we were headed.
p276
aVIf we could build an economy that would use things rather than use them up,
p277
aVwe could build a future that really could work in the long term.
p278
aVI was excited.
p279
aVThis was something to work towards.
p280
aVWe knew exactly where we were headed. We just had to work out how to get there,
p281
aVand it was exactly with this in mind
p282
aVthat we created the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in September 2010.
p283
aa(lp284
VMany schools of thought fed our thinking and pointed to this model:
p285
aVindustrial symbiosis, performance economy, sharing economy, biomimicry,
p286
aVand of course, cradle-to-cradle design.
p287
aVMaterials would be defined as either technical or biological,
p288
aVwaste would be designed out entirely,
p289
aVand we would have a system that could function
p290
aVabsolutely in the long term.
p291
aa(lp292
VSo what could this economy look like?
p293
aVMaybe we wouldn't buy light fittings, but we'd pay for the service of light,
p294
aVand the manufacturers would recover the materials
p295
aVand change the light fittings when we had more efficient products.
p296
aVWhat if packaging was so nontoxic it could dissolve in water
p297
aVand we could ultimately drink it? It would never become waste.
p298
aVWhat if engines were re-manufacturable,
p299
aVand we could recover the component materials
p300
aVand significantly reduce energy demand.
p301
aVWhat if we could recover components from circuit boards, reutilize them,
p302
aVand then fundamentally recover the materials within them
p303
aVthrough a second stage?
p304
aVWhat if we could collect food waste, human waste?
p305
aVWhat if we could turn that into fertilizer, heat, energy,
p306
aVultimately reconnecting nutrients systems
p307
aVand rebuilding natural capital?
p308
aVAnd cars \u2014 what we want is to move around.
p309
aVWe don't need to own the materials within them.
p310
aVCould cars become a service
p311
aVand provide us with mobility in the future?
p312
aVAll of this sounds amazing, but these aren't just ideas, they're real today,
p313
aVand these lie at the forefront of the circular economy.
p314
aVWhat lies before us is to expand them and scale them up.
p315
aa(lp316
VSo how would you shift from linear to circular?
p317
aVWell, the team and I at the foundation thought you might want to work
p318
aVwith the top universities in the world,
p319
aVwith leading businesses within the world,
p320
aVwith the biggest convening platforms in the world,
p321
aVand with governments.
p322
aVWe thought you might want to work with the best analysts
p323
aVand ask them the question,
p324
aV"Can the circular economy decouple growth from resource constraints?
p325
aVIs the circular economy able to rebuild natural capital?
p326
aVCould the circular economy replace current chemical fertilizer use?"
p327
aVYes was the answer to the decoupling,
p328
aVbut also yes, we could replace current fertilizer use
p329
aVby a staggering 2.7 times.
p330
aVBut what inspired me most about the circular economy
p331
aVwas its ability to inspire young people.
p332
aVWhen young people see the economy through a circular lens,
p333
aVthey see brand new opportunities on exactly the same horizon.
p334
aVThey can use their creativity and knowledge
p335
aVto rebuild the entire system,
p336
aVand it's there for the taking right now,
p337
aVand the faster we do this, the better.
p338
aa(lp339
VSo could we achieve this in their lifetimes?
p340
aVIs it actually possible?
p341
aVI believe yes.
p342
aVWhen you look at the lifetime of my great-grandfather, anything's possible.
p343
aVWhen he was born, there were only 25 cars in the world;
p344
aVthey had only just been invented.
p345
aVWhen he was 14, we flew for the first time in history.
p346
aVNow there are 100,000 charter flights
p347
aVevery single day.
p348
aVWhen he was 45, we built the first computer.
p349
aVMany said it wouldn't catch on, but it did, and just 20 years later
p350
aVwe turned it into a microchip
p351
aVof which there will be thousands in this room here today.
p352
aVTen years before he died, we built the first mobile phone.
p353
aVIt wasn't that mobile, to be fair,
p354
aVbut now it really is,
p355
aVand as my great-grandfather left this Earth, the Internet arrived.
p356
aVNow we can do anything,
p357
aVbut more importantly,
p358
aVnow we have a plan.
p359
aa(lp360
VThank you.

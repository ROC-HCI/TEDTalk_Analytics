VI think we have to do something
p5
aVabout a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change.
p6
aVAnd I think it starts with one physician, and that's me.
p7
aVAnd maybe I've been around long enough
p8
aVthat I can afford to give away some of my false prestige
p9
aVto be able to do that.
p10
aVBefore I actually begin the meat of my talk,
p11
aVlet's begin with a bit of baseball.
p12
aVHey, why not?
p13
aVWe're near the end, we're getting close to the World Series.
p14
aVWe all love baseball, don't we?
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aVBaseball is filled with some amazing statistics.
p17
aVAnd there's hundreds of them.
p18
aV"Moneyball" is about to come out, and it's all about statistics
p19
aVand using statistics to build a great baseball team.
p20
aVI'm going to focus on one stat
p21
aVthat I hope a lot of you have heard of.
p22
aVIt's called batting average.
p23
aVSo we talk about a 300, a batter who bats 300.
p24
aVThat means that ballplayer batted safely, hit safely
p25
aVthree times out of 10 at bats.
p26
aVThat means hit the ball into the outfield,
p27
aVit dropped, it didn't get caught,
p28
aVand whoever tried to throw it to first base didn't get there in time
p29
aVand the runner was safe.
p30
aVThree times out of 10.
p31
aVDo you know what they call a 300 hitter
p32
aVin Major League Baseball?
p33
aVGood, really good,
p34
aVmaybe an all-star.
p35
aVDo you know what they call
p36
aVa 400 baseball hitter?
p37
aVThat's somebody who hit, by the way,
p38
aVfour times safely out of every 10.
p39
aVLegendary \u2014
p40
aVas in Ted Williams legendary \u2014
p41
aVthe last Major League Baseball player
p42
aVto hit over 400 during a regular season.
p43
aVNow let's take this back into my world of medicine
p44
aVwhere I'm a lot more comfortable,
p45
aVor perhaps a bit less comfortable
p46
aVafter what I'm going to talk to you about.
p47
aVSuppose you have appendicitis
p48
aVand you're referred to a surgeon
p49
aVwho's batting 400 on appendectomies.
p50
aV(Laughter)
p51
aVSomehow this isn't working out, is it?
p52
aVNow suppose you live
p53
aVin a certain part of a certain remote place
p54
aVand you have a loved one
p55
aVwho has blockages in two coronary arteries
p56
aVand your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist
p57
aVwho's batting 200 on angioplasties.
p58
aVBut, but, you know what?
p59
aVShe's doing a lot better this year. She's on the comeback trail.
p60
aVAnd she's hitting a 257.
p61
aVSomehow this isn't working.
p62
aVBut I'm going to ask you a question.
p63
aVWhat do you think a batting average
p64
aVfor a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner
p65
aVor an orthopedic surgeon,
p66
aVan OBGYN, a paramedic
p67
aVis supposed to be?
p68
aV1,000, very good.
p69
aVNow truth of the matter is,
p70
aVnobody knows in all of medicine
p71
aVwhat a good surgeon
p72
aVor physician or paramedic
p73
aVis supposed to bat.
p74
aVWhat we do though is we send each one of them, including myself,
p75
aVout into the world
p76
aVwith the admonition, be perfect.
p77
aVNever ever, ever make a mistake,
p78
aVbut you worry about the details, about how that's going to happen.
p79
aVAnd that was the message that I absorbed
p80
aVwhen I was in med school.
p81
aVI was an obsessive compulsive student.
p82
aVIn high school, a classmate once said
p83
aVthat Brian Goldman would study for a blood test.
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aVAnd so I did.
p86
aVAnd I studied in my little garret
p87
aVat the nurses' residence at Toronto General Hospital,
p88
aVnot far from here.
p89
aVAnd I memorized everything.
p90
aVI memorized in my anatomy class
p91
aVthe origins and exertions of every muscle,
p92
aVevery branch of every artery that came off the aorta,
p93
aVdifferential diagnoses obscure and common.
p94
aVI even knew the differential diagnosis
p95
aVin how to classify renal tubular acidosis.
p96
aVAnd all the while,
p97
aVI was amassing more and more knowledge.
p98
aVAnd I did well, I graduated with honors,
p99
aVcum laude.
p100
aVAnd I came out of medical school
p101
aVwith the impression
p102
aVthat if I memorized everything and knew everything,
p103
aVor as much as possible,
p104
aVas close to everything as possible,
p105
aVthat it would immunize me against making mistakes.
p106
aVAnd it worked
p107
aVfor a while,
p108
aVuntil I met Mrs. Drucker.
p109
aVI was a resident at a teaching hospital here in Toronto
p110
aVwhen Mrs. Drucker was brought to the emergency department
p111
aVof the hospital where I was working.
p112
aVAt the time I was assigned to the cardiology service
p113
aVon a cardiology rotation.
p114
aVAnd it was my job,
p115
aVwhen the emergency staff called for a cardiology consult,
p116
aVto see that patient in emerg.
p117
aVand to report back to my attending.
p118
aVAnd I saw Mrs. Drucker, and she was breathless.
p119
aVAnd when I listened to her, she was making a wheezy sound.
p120
aVAnd when I listened to her chest with a stethoscope,
p121
aVI could hear crackly sounds on both sides
p122
aVthat told me that she was in congestive heart failure.
p123
aVThis is a condition in which the heart fails,
p124
aVand instead of being able to pump all the blood forward,
p125
aVsome of the blood backs up into the lung, the lungs fill up with blood,
p126
aVand that's why you have shortness of breath.
p127
aVAnd that wasn't a difficult diagnosis to make.
p128
aVI made it and I set to work treating her.
p129
aVI gave her aspirin. I gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart.
p130
aVI gave her medications that we call diuretics, water pills,
p131
aVto get her to pee out the access fluid.
p132
aVAnd over the course of the next hour and a half or two,
p133
aVshe started to feel better.
p134
aVAnd I felt really good.
p135
aVAnd that's when I made my first mistake;
p136
aVI sent her home.
p137
aVActually, I made two more mistakes.
p138
aVI sent her home
p139
aVwithout speaking to my attending.
p140
aVI didn't pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do,
p141
aVwhich was call my attending and run the story by him
p142
aVso he would have a chance to see her for himself.
p143
aVAnd he knew her,
p144
aVhe would have been able to furnish additional information about her.
p145
aVMaybe I did it for a good reason.
p146
aVMaybe I didn't want to be a high-maintenance resident.
p147
aVMaybe I wanted to be so successful
p148
aVand so able to take responsibility
p149
aVthat I would do so
p150
aVand I would be able to take care of my attending's patients
p151
aVwithout even having to contact him.
p152
aVThe second mistake that I made was worse.
p153
aVIn sending her home,
p154
aVI disregarded a little voice deep down inside
p155
aVthat was trying to tell me,
p156
aV"Goldman, not a good idea. Don't do this."
p157
aVIn fact, so lacking in confidence was I
p158
aVthat I actually asked the nurse
p159
aVwho was looking after Mrs. Drucker,
p160
aV"Do you think it's okay if she goes home?"
p161
aVAnd the nurse thought about it
p162
aVand said very matter-of-factly, "Yeah, I think she'll do okay."
p163
aVI can remember that like it was yesterday.
p164
aVSo I signed the discharge papers,
p165
aVand an ambulance came, paramedics came to take her home.
p166
aVAnd I went back to my work on the wards.
p167
aVAll the rest of that day,
p168
aVthat afternoon,
p169
aVI had this kind of gnawing feeling inside my stomach.
p170
aVBut I carried on with my work.
p171
aVAnd at the end of the day, I packed up to leave the hospital
p172
aVand walked to the parking lot
p173
aVto take my car and drive home
p174
aVwhen I did something that I don't usually do.
p175
aVI walked through the emergency department on my way home.
p176
aVAnd it was there that another nurse,
p177
aVnot the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker before, but another nurse,
p178
aVsaid three words to me
p179
aVthat are the three words
p180
aVthat most emergency physicians I know dread.
p181
aVOthers in medicine dread them as well,
p182
aVbut there's something particular about emergency medicine
p183
aVbecause we see patients so fleetingly.
p184
aVThe three words are:
p185
aVDo you remember?
p186
aV"Do you remember that patient you sent home?"
p187
aVthe other nurse asked matter-of-factly.
p188
aV"Well she's back,"
p189
aVin just that tone of voice.
p190
aVWell she was back all right.
p191
aVShe was back and near death.
p192
aVAbout an hour after she had arrived home,
p193
aVafter I'd sent her home,
p194
aVshe collapsed and her family called 911
p195
aVand the paramedics brought her back to the emergency department
p196
aVwhere she had a blood pressure of 50,
p197
aVwhich is in severe shock.
p198
aVAnd she was barely breathing and she was blue.
p199
aVAnd the emerg. staff pulled out all the stops.
p200
aVThey gave her medications to raise her blood pressure.
p201
aVThey put her on a ventilator.
p202
aVAnd I was shocked
p203
aVand shaken to the core.
p204
aVAnd I went through this roller coaster,
p205
aVbecause after they stabilized her,
p206
aVshe went to the intensive care unit,
p207
aVand I hoped against hope that she would recover.
p208
aVAnd over the next two or three days,
p209
aVit was clear that she was never going to wake up.
p210
aVShe had irreversible brain damage.
p211
aVAnd the family gathered.
p212
aVAnd over the course of the next eight or nine days,
p213
aVthey resigned themselves to what was happening.
p214
aVAnd at about the nine day mark, they let her go \u2014
p215
aVMrs. Drucker,
p216
aVa wife, a mother
p217
aVand a grandmother.
p218
aVThey say you never forget the names
p219
aVof those who die.
p220
aVAnd that was my first time to be acquainted with that.
p221
aVOver the next few weeks,
p222
aVI beat myself up
p223
aVand I experienced for the first time
p224
aVthe unhealthy shame that exists
p225
aVin our culture of medicine \u2014
p226
aVwhere I felt alone, isolated,
p227
aVnot feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel,
p228
aVbecause you can't talk about it with your colleagues.
p229
aVYou know that healthy kind,
p230
aVwhen you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal
p231
aVand then you get busted
p232
aVand then your best friend confronts you
p233
aVand you have terrible discussions,
p234
aVbut at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you
p235
aVand you say, I'll never make that mistake again.
p236
aVAnd you make amends and you never make that mistake again.
p237
aVThat's the kind of shame that is a teacher.
p238
aVThe unhealthy shame I'm talking about
p239
aVis the one that makes you so sick inside.
p240
aVIt's the one that says,
p241
aVnot that what you did was bad,
p242
aVbut that you are bad.
p243
aVAnd it was what I was feeling.
p244
aVAnd it wasn't because of my attending; he was a doll.
p245
aVHe talked to the family, and I'm quite sure that he smoothed things over
p246
aVand made sure that I didn't get sued.
p247
aVAnd I kept asking myself these questions.
p248
aVWhy didn't I ask my attending? Why did I send her home?
p249
aVAnd then at my worst moments:
p250
aVWhy did I make such a stupid mistake?
p251
aVWhy did I go into medicine?
p252
aVSlowly but surely,
p253
aVit lifted.
p254
aVI began to feel a bit better.
p255
aVAnd on a cloudy day,
p256
aVthere was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out
p257
aVand I wondered,
p258
aVmaybe I could feel better again.
p259
aVAnd I made myself a bargain
p260
aVthat if only I redouble my efforts to be perfect
p261
aVand never make another mistake again,
p262
aVplease make the voices stop.
p263
aVAnd they did.
p264
aVAnd I went back to work.
p265
aVAnd then it happened again.
p266
aVTwo years later I was an attending in the emergency department
p267
aVat a community hospital just north of Toronto,
p268
aVand I saw a 25 year-old man with a sore throat.
p269
aVIt was busy, I was in a bit of a hurry.
p270
aVHe kept pointing here.
p271
aVI looked at his throat, it was a little bit pink.
p272
aVAnd I gave him a prescription for penicillin
p273
aVand sent him on his way.
p274
aVAnd even as he was walking out the door,
p275
aVhe was still sort of pointing to his throat.
p276
aVAnd two days later I came to do my next emergency shift,
p277
aVand that's when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office.
p278
aVAnd she said the three words:
p279
aVDo you remember?
p280
aV"Do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat?"
p281
aVWell it turns out, he didn't have a strep throat.
p282
aVHe had a potentially life-threatening condition
p283
aVcalled epiglottitis.
p284
aVYou can Google it,
p285
aVbut it's an infection, not of the throat, but of the upper airway,
p286
aVand it can actually cause the airway to close.
p287
aVAnd fortunately he didn't die.
p288
aVHe was placed on intravenous antibiotics
p289
aVand he recovered after a few days.
p290
aVAnd I went through the same period of shame and recriminations
p291
aVand felt cleansed and went back to work,
p292
aVuntil it happened again and again and again.
p293
aVTwice in one emergency shift, I missed appendicitis.
p294
aVNow that takes some doing,
p295
aVespecially when you work in a hospital
p296
aVthat at the time saw but 14 people a night.
p297
aVNow in both cases, I didn't send them home
p298
aVand I don't think there was any gap in their care.
p299
aVOne I thought had a kidney stone.
p300
aVI ordered a kidney X-ray. When it turned out to be normal,
p301
aVmy colleague who was doing a reassessment of the patient
p302
aVnoticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant and called the surgeons.
p303
aVThe other one had a lot of diarrhea.
p304
aVI ordered some fluids to rehydrate him
p305
aVand asked my colleague to reassess him.
p306
aVAnd he did
p307
aVand when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant, called the surgeons.
p308
aVIn both cases,
p309
aVthey had their operations and they did okay.
p310
aVBut each time,
p311
aVthey were gnawing at me, eating at me.
p312
aVAnd I'd like to be able to say to you
p313
aVthat my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice
p314
aVas many of my colleagues say, which is total B.S.
p315
aV(Laughter)
p316
aVSome of my doozies have been in the last five years.
p317
aVAlone, ashamed and unsupported.
p318
aVHere's the problem:
p319
aVIf I can't come clean
p320
aVand talk about my mistakes,
p321
aVif I can't find the still-small voice
p322
aVthat tells me what really happened,
p323
aVhow can I share it with my colleagues?
p324
aVHow can I teach them about what I did
p325
aVso that they don't do the same thing?
p326
aVIf I were to walk into a room \u2014
p327
aVlike right now, I have no idea what you think of me.
p328
aVWhen was the last time you heard somebody talk
p329
aVabout failure after failure after failure?
p330
aVOh yeah, you go to a cocktail party
p331
aVand you might hear about some other doctor,
p332
aVbut you're not going to hear somebody
p333
aVtalking about their own mistakes.
p334
aVIf I were to walk into a room filled with my colleages
p335
aVand ask for their support right now
p336
aVand start to tell what I've just told you right now,
p337
aVI probably wouldn't get through two of those stories
p338
aVbefore they would start to get really uncomfortable,
p339
aVsomebody would crack a joke,
p340
aVthey'd change the subject and we would move on.
p341
aVAnd in fact, if I knew and my colleagues knew
p342
aVthat one of my orthopedic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital,
p343
aVbelieve me, I'd have trouble
p344
aVmaking eye contact with that person.
p345
aVThat's the system that we have.
p346
aVIt's a complete denial of mistakes.
p347
aVIt's a system
p348
aVin which there are two kinds of physicians \u2014
p349
aVthose who make mistakes
p350
aVand those who don't,
p351
aVthose who can't handle sleep deprivation and those who can,
p352
aVthose who have lousy outcomes
p353
aVand those who have great outcomes.
p354
aVAnd it's almost like an ideological reaction,
p355
aVlike the antibodies begin to attack that person.
p356
aVAnd we have this idea
p357
aVthat if we drive the people who make mistakes
p358
aVout of medicine,
p359
aVwhat will we be left with, but a safe system.
p360
aVBut there are two problems with that.
p361
aVIn my 20 years or so
p362
aVof medical broadcasting and journalism,
p363
aVI've made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors
p364
aVto learn everything I can,
p365
aVfrom one of the first articles I wrote for the Toronto Star
p366
aVto my show "White Coat, Black Art."
p367
aVAnd what I've learned
p368
aVis that errors are absolutely ubiquitous.
p369
aVWe work in a system
p370
aVwhere errors happen every day,
p371
aVwhere one in 10 medications
p372
aVare either the wrong medication given in hospital
p373
aVor at the wrong dosage,
p374
aVwhere hospital-acquired infections are getting more and more numerous,
p375
aVcausing havoc and death.
p376
aVIn this country,
p377
aVas many as 24,000 Canadians die
p378
aVof preventable medical errors.
p379
aVIn the United States, the Institute of Medicine pegged it at 100,000.
p380
aVIn both cases, these are gross underestimates,
p381
aVbecause we really aren't ferreting out the problem
p382
aVas we should.
p383
aVAnd here's the thing.
p384
aVIn a hospital system
p385
aVwhere medical knowledge is doubling
p386
aVevery two or three years, we can't keep up with it.
p387
aVSleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive.
p388
aVWe can't get rid of it.
p389
aVWe have our cognitive biases,
p390
aVso that I can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain.
p391
aVNow take the same patient with chest pain,
p392
aVmake them moist and garrulous
p393
aVand put a little bit of alcohol on their breath,
p394
aVand suddenly my history is laced with contempt.
p395
aVI don't take the same history.
p396
aVI'm not a robot;
p397
aVI don't do things the same way each time.
p398
aVAnd my patients aren't cars;
p399
aVthey don't tell me their symptoms in the same way each time.
p400
aVGiven all of that, mistakes are inevitable.
p401
aVSo if you take the system, as I was taught,
p402
aVand weed out all the error-prone health professionals,
p403
aVwell there won't be anybody left.
p404
aVAnd you know that business
p405
aVabout people not wanting
p406
aVto talk about their worst cases?
p407
aVOn my show, on "White Coat, Black Art,"
p408
aVI made it a habit of saying, "Here's my worst mistake,"
p409
aVI would say to everybody
p410
aVfrom paramedics to the chief of cardiac surgery,
p411
aV"Here's my worst mistake," blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
p412
aV"What about yours?" and I would point the microphone towards them.
p413
aVAnd their pupils would dilate,
p414
aVthey would recoil,
p415
aVthen they would look down and swallow hard
p416
aVand start to tell me their stories.
p417
aVThey want to tell their stories. They want to share their stories.
p418
aVThey want to be able to say,
p419
aV"Look, don't make the same mistake I did."
p420
aVWhat they need is an environment to be able to do that.
p421
aVWhat they need is a redefined medical culture.
p422
aVAnd it starts with one physician at a time.
p423
aVThe redefined physician is human,
p424
aVknows she's human,
p425
aVaccepts it, isn't proud of making mistakes,
p426
aVbut strives to learn one thing
p427
aVfrom what happened
p428
aVthat she can teach to somebody else.
p429
aVShe shares her experience with others.
p430
aVShe's supportive when other people talk about their mistakes.
p431
aVAnd she points out other people's mistakes,
p432
aVnot in a gotcha way,
p433
aVbut in a loving, supportive way
p434
aVso that everybody can benefit.
p435
aVAnd she works in a culture of medicine
p436
aVthat acknowledges
p437
aVthat human beings run the system,
p438
aVand when human beings run the system, they will make mistakes from time to time.
p439
aVSo the system is evolving
p440
aVto create backups
p441
aVthat make it easier to detect those mistakes
p442
aVthat humans inevitably make
p443
aVand also fosters in a loving, supportive way
p444
aVplaces where everybody who is observing
p445
aVin the health care system
p446
aVcan actually point out things that could be potential mistakes

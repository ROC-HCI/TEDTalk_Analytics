VI have a confession to make.
p5
aVI'm a business professor
p6
aVwhose ambition has been to help people learn to lead.
p7
aVBut recently, I've discovered
p8
aVthat what many of us think of as great leadership
p9
aVdoes not work when it comes to leading innovation.
p10
aa(lp11
VI'm an ethnographer.
p12
aVI use the methods of anthropology
p13
aVto understand the questions in which I'm interested.
p14
aVSo along with three co-conspirators,
p15
aVI spent nearly a decade observing up close and personal
p16
aVexceptional leaders of innovation.
p17
aVWe studied 16 men and women,
p18
aVlocated in seven countries across the globe,
p19
aVworking in 12 different industries.
p20
aVIn total, we spent hundreds of hours on the ground,
p21
aVon-site, watching these leaders in action.
p22
aVWe ended up with pages and pages and pages of field notes
p23
aVthat we analyzed and looked for patterns in what our leaders did.
p24
aVThe bottom line?
p25
aVIf we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again,
p26
aVwe must unlearn our conventional notions of leadership.
p27
aa(lp28
VLeading innovation is not about creating a vision,
p29
aVand inspiring others to execute it.
p30
aVBut what do we mean by innovation?
p31
aVAn innovation is anything that is both new and useful.
p32
aVIt can be a product or service.
p33
aVIt can be a process or a way of organizing.
p34
aVIt can be incremental, or it can be breakthrough.
p35
aVWe have a pretty inclusive definition.
p36
aa(lp37
VHow many of you recognize this man?
p38
aVPut your hands up.
p39
aVKeep your hands up, if you know who this is.
p40
aVHow about these familiar faces?
p41
aV(Laughter)
p42
aVFrom your show of hands,
p43
aVit looks like many of you have seen a Pixar movie,
p44
aVbut very few of you recognized Ed Catmull,
p45
aVthe founder and CEO of Pixar \u2014
p46
aVone of the companies I had the privilege of studying.
p47
aa(lp48
VMy first visit to Pixar was in 2005,
p49
aVwhen they were working on "Ratatouille,"
p50
aVthat provocative movie about a rat becoming a master chef.
p51
aVComputer-generated movies are really mainstream today,
p52
aVbut it took Ed and his colleagues nearly 20 years
p53
aVto create the first full-length C.G. movie.
p54
aVIn the 20 years hence, they've produced 14 movies.
p55
aVI was recently at Pixar, and I'm here to tell you
p56
aVthat number 15 is sure to be a winner.
p57
aa(lp58
VWhen many of us think about innovation, though,
p59
aVwe think about an Einstein having an 'Aha!' moment.
p60
aVBut we all know that's a myth.
p61
aVInnovation is not about solo genius,
p62
aVit's about collective genius.
p63
aVLet's think for a minute about what it takes to make a Pixar movie:
p64
aVNo solo genius, no flash of inspiration produces one of those movies.
p65
aVOn the contrary, it takes about 250 people four to five years,
p66
aVto make one of those movies.
p67
aa(lp68
VTo help us understand the process,
p69
aVan individual in the studio drew a version of this picture.
p70
aVHe did so reluctantly,
p71
aVbecause it suggested that the process  was a neat series of steps
p72
aVdone by discrete groups.
p73
aVEven with all those arrows, he thought it failed to really tell you
p74
aVjust how iterative, interrelated and, frankly, messy their process was.
p75
aa(lp76
VThroughout the making of a movie at Pixar, the story evolves.
p77
aVSo think about it.
p78
aVSome shots go through quickly.
p79
aVThey don't all go through in order.
p80
aVIt depends on how vexing the challenges are
p81
aVthat they come up with when they are working on a particular scene.
p82
aVSo if you think about that scene in "Up"
p83
aVwhere the boy hands the piece of chocolate to the bird,
p84
aVthat 10 seconds took one animator almost six months to perfect.
p85
aa(lp86
VThe other thing about a Pixar movie
p87
aVis that no part of the movie is considered finished
p88
aVuntil the entire movie wraps.
p89
aVPartway through one production, an animator drew a character
p90
aVwith an arched eyebrow that suggested a mischievous side.
p91
aVWhen the director saw that drawing, he thought it was great.
p92
aVIt was beautiful, but he said,
p93
aV"You've got to lose it; it doesn't fit the character."
p94
aVTwo weeks later, the director came back and said,
p95
aV"Let's put in those few seconds of film."
p96
aVBecause that animator was allowed to share
p97
aVwhat we referred to as his slice of genius,
p98
aVhe was able to help that director reconceive the character
p99
aVin a subtle but important way that really improved the story.
p100
aa(lp101
VWhat we know is, at the heart of innovation is a paradox.
p102
aVYou have to unleash the talents and passions of many people
p103
aVand you have to harness them into a work that is actually useful.
p104
aVInnovation is a journey.
p105
aVIt's a type of collaborative problem solving,
p106
aVusually among people who have different expertise
p107
aVand different points of view.
p108
aa(lp109
VInnovations rarely get created full-blown.
p110
aVAs many of you know,
p111
aVthey're the result, usually, of trial and error.
p112
aVLots of false starts, missteps and mistakes.
p113
aVInnovative work can be very exhilarating,
p114
aVbut it also can be really downright scary.
p115
aVSo when we look at why it is that Pixar is able to do what it does,
p116
aVwe have to ask ourselves, what's going on here?
p117
aa(lp118
VFor sure, history and certainly Hollywood,
p119
aVis full of star-studded teams that have failed.
p120
aVMost of those failures are attributed
p121
aVto too many stars or too many cooks, if you will, in the kitchen.
p122
aVSo why is it that Pixar, with all of its cooks,
p123
aVis able to be so successful time and time again?
p124
aVWhen we studied an Islamic Bank in Dubai,
p125
aVor a luxury brand in Korea, or a social enterprise in Africa,
p126
aVwe found that innovative organizations
p127
aVare communities that have three capabilities:
p128
aVcreative abrasion, creative agility and creative resolution.
p129
aVCreative abrasion is about being able to create a marketplace of ideas
p130
aVthrough debate and discourse.
p131
aVIn innovative organizations, they amplify differences,
p132
aVthey don't minimize them.
p133
aVCreative abrasion is not about brainstorming,
p134
aVwhere people suspend their judgment.
p135
aVNo, they know how to have very heated but constructive arguments
p136
aVto create a portfolio of alternatives.
p137
aa(lp138
VIndividuals in innovative organizations
p139
aVlearn how to inquire, they learn how to actively listen, but guess what?
p140
aVThey also learn how to advocate for their point of view.
p141
aVThey understand that innovation rarely happens
p142
aVunless you have both diversity and conflict.
p143
aVCreative agility is about being able to test and refine that portfolio of ideas
p144
aVthrough quick pursuit, reflection and adjustment.
p145
aVIt's about discovery-driven learning
p146
aVwhere you act, as opposed to plan, your way to the future.
p147
aVIt's about design thinking where you have that interesting combination
p148
aVof the scientific method and the artistic process.
p149
aVIt's about running a series of experiments, and not a series of pilots.
p150
aa(lp151
VExperiments are usually about learning.
p152
aVWhen you get a negative outcome,
p153
aVyou're still really learning something that you need to know.
p154
aVPilots are often about being right.
p155
aVWhen they don't work, someone or something is to blame.
p156
aVThe final capability is creative resolution.
p157
aVThis is about doing decision making
p158
aVin a way that you can actually combine even opposing ideas
p159
aVto reconfigure them in new combinations
p160
aVto produce a solution that is new and useful.
p161
aVWhen you look at innovative organizations, they never go along to get along.
p162
aVThey don't compromise.
p163
aVThey don't let one group or one individual dominate,
p164
aVeven if it's the boss, even if it's the expert.
p165
aVInstead, they have developed
p166
aVa rather patient and more inclusive decision making process
p167
aVthat allows for both/and solutions to arise
p168
aVand not simply either/or solutions.
p169
aVThese three capabilities are why we see
p170
aVthat Pixar is able to do what it does.
p171
aa(lp172
VLet me give you another example,
p173
aVand that example is the infrastructure group of Google.
p174
aVThe infrastructure group of Google is the group
p175
aVthat has to keep the website up and running 24/7.
p176
aVSo when Google was about to introduce Gmail and YouTube,
p177
aVthey knew that their data storage system wasn't adequate.
p178
aVThe head of the engineering group and the infrastructure group at that time
p179
aVwas a man named Bill Coughran.
p180
aVBill and his leadership team, who he referred to as his brain trust,
p181
aVhad to figure out what to do about this situation.
p182
aVThey thought about it for a while.
p183
aVInstead of creating a group to tackle this task,
p184
aVthey decided to allow groups to emerge spontaneously
p185
aVaround different alternatives.
p186
aa(lp187
VTwo groups coalesced.
p188
aVOne became known as Big Table,
p189
aVthe other became known as Build It From Scratch.
p190
aVBig Table proposed that they build on the current system.
p191
aVBuild It From Scratch proposed that it was time for a whole new system.
p192
aVSeparately, these two teams were allowed to work full-time
p193
aVon their particular approach.
p194
aVIn engineering reviews, Bill described his role as,
p195
aV"Injecting honesty into the process by driving debate."
p196
aa(lp197
VEarly on, the teams were encouraged to build prototypes so that they could
p198
aV"bump them up against reality and discover for themselves
p199
aVthe strengths and weaknesses of their particular approach."
p200
aVWhen Build It From Scratch shared their prototype with the group
p201
aVwhose beepers would have to go off in the middle of the night
p202
aVif something went wrong with the website,
p203
aVthey heard loud and clear about the limitations of their particular design.
p204
aVAs the need for a solution became more urgent
p205
aVand as the data, or the evidence, began to come in,
p206
aVit became pretty clear that the Big Table solution
p207
aVwas the right one for the moment.
p208
aVSo they selected that one.
p209
aa(lp210
VBut to make sure that they did not lose the learning
p211
aVof the Build it From Scratch team,
p212
aVBill asked two members of that team to join a new team that was emerging
p213
aVto work on the next-generation system.
p214
aVThis whole process took nearly two years,
p215
aVbut I was told that they were all working at breakneck speed.
p216
aa(lp217
VEarly in that process, one of the engineers had gone to Bill and said,
p218
aV"We're all too busy for this inefficient system
p219
aVof running parallel experiments."
p220
aVBut as the process unfolded, he began to understand
p221
aVthe wisdom of allowing talented people to play out their passions.
p222
aVHe admitted, "If you had forced us to all be on one team,
p223
aVwe might have focused on proving who was right, and winning,
p224
aVand not on learning and discovering what was the best answer for Google."
p225
aa(lp226
VWhy is it that Pixar and Google are able to innovate time and again?
p227
aVIt's because they've mastered the capabilities required for that.
p228
aVThey know how to do collaborative problem solving,
p229
aVthey know how to do discovery-driven learning
p230
aVand they know how to do integrated decision making.
p231
aa(lp232
VSome of you may be sitting there and saying to yourselves right now,
p233
aV"We don't know how to do those things in my organization.
p234
aVSo why do they know how to do those things at Pixar,
p235
aVand why do they know how to do those things at Google?"
p236
aVWhen many of the people that worked for Bill told us,
p237
aVin their opinion, that Bill was one of the finest leaders in Silicon Valley,
p238
aVwe completely agreed; the man is a genius.
p239
aa(lp240
VLeadership is the secret sauce.
p241
aVBut it's a different kind of leadership,
p242
aVnot the kind many of us think about when we think about great leadership.
p243
aVOne of the leaders I met with early on said to me,
p244
aV"Linda, I don't read books on leadership.
p245
aVAll they do is make me feel bad." (Laughter)
p246
aV"In the first chapter they say I'm supposed to create a vision.
p247
aVBut if I'm trying to do something that's truly new, I have no answers.
p248
aVI don't know what direction we're going in
p249
aVand I'm not even sure I know how to figure out how to get there."
p250
aVFor sure, there are times when visionary leadership
p251
aVis exactly what is needed.
p252
aa(lp253
VBut if we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again,
p254
aVwe must recast our understanding of what leadership is about.
p255
aVLeading innovation is about creating the space
p256
aVwhere people are willing and able to do the hard work
p257
aVof innovative problem solving.
p258
aa(lp259
VAt this point, some of you may be wondering,
p260
aV"What does that leadership really look like?"
p261
aVAt Pixar, they understand that innovation takes a village.
p262
aVThe leaders focus on building a sense of community
p263
aVand building those three capabilities.
p264
aVHow do they define leadership?
p265
aVThey say leadership is about creating a world
p266
aVto which people want to belong.
p267
aVWhat kind of world do people want to belong in at Pixar?
p268
aVA world where you're living at the frontier.
p269
aVWhat do they focus their time on?
p270
aVNot on creating a vision.
p271
aVInstead they spend their time thinking about,
p272
aV"How do we design a studio that has the sensibility of a public square
p273
aVso that people will interact?
p274
aVLet's put in a policy that anyone, no matter what their level or role,
p275
aVis allowed to give notes to the director
p276
aVabout how they feel about a particular film.
p277
aVWhat can we do to make sure
p278
aVthat all the disruptors, all the minority voices in this organization,
p279
aVspeak up and are heard?
p280
aVAnd, finally, let's bestow credit in a very generous way."
p281
aVI don't know if you've ever looked at the credits of a Pixar movie,
p282
aVbut the babies born during a production are listed there.
p283
aV(Laughter)
p284
aa(lp285
VHow did Bill think about what his role was?
p286
aVBill said, "I lead a volunteer organization.
p287
aVTalented people don't want to follow me anywhere.
p288
aVThey want to cocreate with me the future.
p289
aVMy job is to nurture the bottom-up
p290
aVand not let it degenerate into chaos."
p291
aVHow did he see his role?
p292
aV"I'm a role model, I'm a human glue,
p293
aVI'm a connector, I'm an aggregator of viewpoints.
p294
aVI'm never a dictator of viewpoints."
p295
aVAdvice about how you exercise the role?
p296
aVHire people who argue with you.
p297
aVAnd, guess what?
p298
aVSometimes it's best to be deliberately fuzzy and vague.
p299
aa(lp300
VSome of you may be wondering now,
p301
aVwhat are these people thinking?
p302
aVThey're thinking,
p303
aV"I'm not the visionary, I'm the social architect.
p304
aVI'm creating the space where people are willing and able
p305
aVto share and combine their talents and passions."
p306
aVIf some of you are worrying now that you don't work at a Pixar,
p307
aVor you don't work at a Google,
p308
aVI want to tell you there's still hope.
p309
aVWe've studied many organizations
p310
aVthat were really not organizations you'd think of
p311
aVas ones where a lot of innovation happens.
p312
aa(lp313
VWe studied a general counsel in a pharmaceutical company
p314
aVwho had to figure out how to get the outside lawyers,
p315
aV19 competitors, to collaborate and innovate.
p316
aVWe studied the head of marketing at a German automaker
p317
aVwhere, fundamentally, they believed that it was the design engineers,
p318
aVnot the marketeers, who were allowed to be innovative.
p319
aVWe also studied Vineet Nayar at HCL Technologies,
p320
aVan Indian outsourcing company.
p321
aVWhen we met Vineet,
p322
aVhis company was about, in his words, to become irrelevant.
p323
aVWe watched as he turned that company into a global dynamo of I.T. innovation.
p324
aVAt HCL technologies, like at many companies,
p325
aVthe leaders had learned to see their role as setting direction
p326
aVand making sure that no one deviated from it.
p327
aVWhat he did is tell them it was time for them
p328
aVto think about rethinking what they were supposed to do.
p329
aVBecause what was happening is that everybody was looking up
p330
aVand you weren't seeing the kind of bottom-up innovation
p331
aVwe saw at Pixar or Google.
p332
aVSo they began to work on that.
p333
aa(lp334
VThey stopped giving answers, they stopped trying to provide solutions.
p335
aVInstead, what they did is they began to see
p336
aVthe people at the bottom of the pyramid, the young sparks,
p337
aVthe people who were closest to the customers,
p338
aVas the source of innovation.
p339
aVThey began to transfer the organization's growth
p340
aVto that level.
p341
aVIn Vineet's language, this was about inverting the pyramid
p342
aVso that you could unleash the power of the many
p343
aVby loosening the stranglehold of the few,
p344
aVand increase the quality and the speed of innovation
p345
aVthat was happening every day.
p346
aa(lp347
VFor sure, Vineet and all the other leaders that we studied
p348
aVwere in fact visionaries.
p349
aVFor sure, they understood that that was not their role.
p350
aVSo I don't think it is accidental that many of you did not recognize Ed.
p351
aVBecause Ed, like Vineet, understands that our role as leaders
p352
aVis to set the stage, not perform on it.
p353
aVIf we want to invent a better future,
p354
aVand I suspect that's why many of us are here,
p355
aVthen we need to reimagine our task.
p356
aVOur task is to create the space
p357
aVwhere everybody's slices of genius
p358
aVcan be unleashed and harnessed,
p359
aVand turned into works of collective genius.
p360
aa(lp361
VThank you.

VI've always wanted to be a cyborg.
p5
aVOne of my favorite shows as a kid was "The Six Million Dollar Man,"
p6
aVand this is a little bit closer to the 240-dollar man or so, but \u2014
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VAt any rate, I would normally feel very self-conscious and geeky
p11
aVwearing this around,
p12
aVbut a few days ago I saw one world-renowned statistician
p13
aVswallowing swords on stage here,
p14
aVso I figure it's OK amongst this group.
p15
aVBut that's not what I want to talk about today.
p16
aVI want to talk about toys, and the power that I see inherent in them.
p17
aa(lp18
VWhen I was a kid, I attended Montessori school
p19
aVup to sixth grade in Atlanta, Georgia.
p20
aVAnd at the time I didn't think much about it,
p21
aVbut then later, I realized that that was the high point of my education.
p22
aVFrom that point on, everything else was pretty much downhill.
p23
aVAnd it wasn't until later, as I started making games, that \u2014
p24
aVI really actually think of them more as toys.
p25
aVPeople call me a game designer,
p26
aVbut I really think of these things more as toys.
p27
aVI started getting very interested in Maria Montessori and her methods,
p28
aVand the way she went about things,
p29
aVand the way she thought it very valuable for kids
p30
aVto discover things on their own
p31
aVrather than being taught these things overtly.
p32
aVAnd she would design these toys, where kids in playing with the toys
p33
aVwould come to understand these deep principles
p34
aVof life and nature through play.
p35
aVAnd since they discovered this, it stuck with them so much more,
p36
aVand also they would experience their own failures.
p37
aVThere was a failure-based aspect to learning there. It was very important.
p38
aVAnd so, the games that I do,
p39
aVI think of really more as modern Montessori toys.
p40
aVAnd I really kind of want them to be presented in a way
p41
aVto where kids can kind of explore and discover their own principles.
p42
aVSo a few years ago,
p43
aa(lp44
VI started getting very interested in the SETI program.
p45
aVAnd that's the way I work.
p46
aVI get interested in different subjects, I dive in, research them,
p47
aVand then try to figure out how to craft a toy around that,
p48
aVso that other people can experience the same sense of discovery
p49
aVthat I did as I was learning that subject.
p50
aVAnd it led me to astrobiology,
p51
aVthe study of possible life in the universe.
p52
aVAnd then Drake's equation,
p53
aVlooking at the probability of life arising on planets,
p54
aVhow long it might last, how many planets are out there.
p55
aVAnd I started looking at how interesting Drake's equation was,
p56
aVbecause it spanned all these different subjects \u2014
p57
aVphysics, chemistry, sociology, economics, astronomy.
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd another thing that really impressed me a long time ago
p60
aVwas "Powers of Ten," Charles and Ray Eames' film.
p61
aVAnd I started putting those two together and wondering, could I build a toy
p62
aVwhere kids would trip across all these interesting principles of life,
p63
aVas it exists and as it might go in the future.
p64
aVThings where you might trip across things
p65
aVlike the Copernican principle, the Fermi paradox,
p66
aVthe anthropic principle, the origin of life.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd so I'm going to show you a toy today that I've been working on,
p69
aVthat I think of more as kind of a philosophy toy.
p70
aVPlaying this toy will bring up philosophical questions in you.
p71
aa(lp72
VThe game is "Spore." I've been working on it for several years.
p73
aVIt's getting pretty close to finished now.
p74
aVIt occurs at all these different scales, from very small to very large.
p75
aVI'm going to pop in at the start of the game.
p76
aVAnd you actually start this game in a drop of water,
p77
aVas a very, very small single-cell creature,
p78
aVand right off the bat you basically just have to live, survive, reproduce.
p79
aVSo here we are, at a very microscopic scale,
p80
aVswimming around.
p81
aVAnd I actually realize that cells don't have eyes,
p82
aVbut it helps to make it cute.
p83
aa(lp84
VThe players are going to play through every generation of this species,
p85
aVand as you play the game,
p86
aVthe creature is actually growing bit by bit.
p87
aVAnd as we start growing,
p88
aVthe camera will actually start zooming out,
p89
aVand things that you see in the background there
p90
aVwill start slowly pulling into the foreground,
p91
aVshowing you a little bit of what you'll be interacting with as you grow.
p92
aVSo as we eat, the camera starts pulling out,
p93
aVand then we start interacting with larger and larger organisms.
p94
aa(lp95
VWe actually play through many generations here,
p96
aVat the cellular scale.
p97
aVI'm going to skip ahead here.
p98
aVAt some point we get larger,
p99
aVand we actually get to a macroevolution scale.
p100
aVNow, at this point we're leaving the water,
p101
aVand one thing that's kind of important about this game is that, at every level,
p102
aVthe player is designing their creature,
p103
aVand that's a fundamental aspect of this.
p104
aa(lp105
VNow, in the evolution game here, the creature scale,
p106
aVbasically you have to eat, survive, and then reproduce.
p107
aVYou know, very Darwinian.
p108
aVOne thing we noticed with "The Sims," a game I did earlier,
p109
aVis that players love making stuff.
p110
aVWhen they were able to make stuff in the game,
p111
aVthey had a lot of empathy in connection to it.
p112
aVEven if it wasn't as pretty
p113
aVas a professional artist would make for games,
p114
aVit really stuck with them
p115
aVand they really cared about what would happen to it.
p116
aa(lp117
VAt this point, we've left the water, and now with this little creature \u2014
p118
aVwe could bring up the volume a little bit \u2014
p119
aVand now we might try to eat.
p120
aVWe might sneak up on this little guy over here maybe,
p121
aVand try and eat him.
p122
aVOK, well, we fight.
p123
aa(lp124
V(Creatures grunting)
p125
aa(lp126
VOK, we got him.
p127
aVNow we get a meal.
p128
aVSo really, at this part of the game,
p129
aVwhat we're doing is we're running around and surviving,
p130
aVand also getting to the next generation,
p131
aVbecause we're going to play through every generation of this creature.
p132
aVWe can mate, so I'm going to see
p133
aVif one of these creatures wants to mate with me. Yeah.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Creatures grunting)
p136
aa(lp137
VWe didn't want to replay actual evolution with humans and all that,
p138
aVbecause it's almost more interesting
p139
aVto look at alternate possibilities in evolution.
p140
aVEvolution is usually presented as this one path that we took through,
p141
aVbut really it represents this huge set of possibilities.
p142
aVNow, once we mate, we click on the egg.
p143
aVAnd this is where the game starts getting interesting,
p144
aVbecause one of the things we really focused on here
p145
aVwas giving the players very high-leverage tools,
p146
aVso that for very little effort, the player can make something very cool.
p147
aVAnd it involves a lot of intelligence on the tool side.
p148
aa(lp149
VBut basically, this is the editor
p150
aVwhere we're going to design the next generation.
p151
aVSo it has a little spine. I can move around, I can extend.
p152
aVI can also inflate or deflate it with the mouse wheel,
p153
aVso you sculpt it like clay.
p154
aVWe have parts here that I can put on or pull off.
p155
aVThe idea is that the player can basically design
p156
aVanything they can think of in this editor,
p157
aVand we'll basically bring it to life.
p158
aVSo I might put some limbs on the character here.
p159
aVI'll inflate them kind of large.
p160
aVAnd in this case I might decide I'm going to put \u2014
p161
aVI'll put mouths on the limbs.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo pretty much players are encouraged to be very creative in the game.
p164
aVHere, I'll give it one eye in the middle, maybe scale it up a bit. Point it down.
p165
aVAnd I'll also give it a few legs.
p166
aVSo in some sense
p167
aVwe want this to feel like an amplifier for the player's imagination,
p168
aVso that with a very small number of clicks a player can create something
p169
aVthat they didn't really think was possible before.
p170
aVThis is almost like designing something like Maya \u2014
p171
aVthat an eight-year-old can use.
p172
aVBut really the goal here was,
p173
aVwithin about a minute, I wanted somebody to replicate
p174
aVwhat typically takes a pictorial artist several weeks to create.
p175
aVOK, now I'll put some hands on it.
p176
aVOK, so here I've basically thrown together a little creature.
p177
aVLet me give it a little weapon on the tail here, so it can fight.
p178
aVOK, so that's the complete model.
p179
aVNow we can actually go to the painting phase.
p180
aa(lp181
VAt this phase, the program has some understanding
p182
aVof the topology of this creature.
p183
aVIt knows where the backbone is, where the spine, the limbs are,
p184
aVhow stripes should run, how it should be shaded.
p185
aVAnd so we're procedurally generating the texture map,
p186
aVsomething a texture artist would take many days to work on.
p187
aVAnd then we can test it out, and see how it would move around.
p188
aVAnd so at this point the computer is procedurally animating this creature.
p189
aVIt's looking at whatever I've designed. It will actually bring it to life.
p190
aVAnd I can see how it might dance.
p191
aa(lp192
V(Laughter)
p193
aa(lp194
VHow it might show emotions, how it might fight.
p195
aVSo it's acting with its two mouths there.
p196
aVI can even have it pose for a photo.
p197
aVSnap a little photo of it.
p198
aa(lp199
V(Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
VSo then I bring this back into the game.
p202
aVIt's born, and I play the next generation of my creature through evolution.
p203
aVNow again, the empathy that the players have
p204
aVwhen they create the content is tremendous.
p205
aVWhen players create content in this game, it's automatically sent up to a server
p206
aVand then redistributed to all the other players transparently.
p207
aVSo in fact, as I'm interacting in this world with other creatures,
p208
aVthese creatures are transparently coming from other players as they play.
p209
aVSo the process of playing the game
p210
aVis a process of building up this huge database of content.
p211
aVAnd pretty much everything you're going to see in this game,
p212
aVthere's an editor for that the player can create,
p213
aVup through civilization.
p214
aVThis is my baby. When I eat, I'll actually start growing.
p215
aa(lp216
VThis is the next generation. But I'm going to skip ahead here.
p217
aVNormally what would happen is these creatures would work their way up,
p218
aVeventually become intelligent.
p219
aVI'd start dealing with tribes, cities and civilizations of them over time.
p220
aVI'm going to skip way ahead to the space phase.
p221
aVEventually they would go out into space,
p222
aVand start colonizing and exploring the universe.
p223
aVNow, really, in some sense,
p224
aVI want the players to be building this world in their imagination,
p225
aVand then extracting it from them with the least amount of pain.
p226
aa(lp227
VSo that's kind of what these tools are about.
p228
aVHow do we make the gameplay,
p229
aVyou know, basically the player's imagination amplifier?
p230
aVAnd how do we make these tools, these editors,
p231
aVsomething that are just as fun as the game itself?
p232
aVSo this is the planet that we've been playing on
p233
aVup to this point in the game.
p234
aVSo far the entire game has been played on the surface of this little world here.
p235
aa(lp236
VAt this point we're actually dealing with a very little toy planet.
p237
aVAlmost, again, like the Montessori toy idea.
p238
aVWhat happens if you give somebody a toy planet,
p239
aVand let them play with a lot of dynamics on it?
p240
aVWhat could they discover? What might they learn on this?
p241
aVThis world was actually extracted from the player's imagination.
p242
aVSo, this is the planet that the player evolved on.
p243
aVThings like the buildings, the vehicles, the architecture, civilizations
p244
aVwere all designed by the player up to this point.
p245
aVSo here's a little city with some of our guys walking around in it.
p246
aVAnd most games put the player in the role of Luke Skywalker,
p247
aVthis protagonist playing through this story.
p248
aVThis is more about putting the player in the role of George Lucas.
p249
aVI want them, after they've played this game,
p250
aVto have extracted an entire world that they're now interacting with.
p251
aa(lp252
VAs we pull down here,
p253
aVwe still have a whole set of creatures living on the surface of the planet.
p254
aVAll these different dynamics going on here.
p255
aVI can look over here, and this is a little simplified food web
p256
aVthat's going on with the creatures.
p257
aVI can open this up and then scan what exists on the surface.
p258
aa(lp259
VYou get some sense of the diversity of creatures that were brought in.
p260
aVSome of these were created by the player,
p261
aVothers by other players, automatically sent over here.
p262
aVBut there's a very simple calculation of what's required,
p263
aVhow many plants are required for the herbivores to live,
p264
aVhow many herbivores for the carnivores to eat, etc.,
p265
aVthat you have to balance actively.
p266
aVAlso with this phase,
p267
aVwe're getting more and more God-like powers for the player,
p268
aVand you can experiment with this planet as a toy.
p269
aVSo I can come in and I can do things,
p270
aVand just treat this planet as a lump of clay.
p271
aVWe have very simple weather systems, simple geology.
p272
aVFor instance, I could open one of my tools here and then carve out rivers.
p273
aVSo this whole thing is kind of like a big lump of clay, a sculpture.
p274
aVI can also play with the dynamics in this world over time.
p275
aa(lp276
VSo one of the things I can do
p277
aVis start pumping more CO2 gases into the atmosphere,
p278
aVand so that's what I'm doing here.
p279
aVThere's actually a little readout down there
p280
aVof our planetary atmosphere, pressure and temperature.
p281
aVSo as I start pumping in more atmosphere,
p282
aVwe're going to start pushing up the greenhouse gases here
p283
aVand if you'll start noticing,
p284
aVwe start seeing the ocean levels rise over time.
p285
aVAnd our cities are going to be at risk too,
p286
aVbecause a lot of these are coastal cities.
p287
aVYou can see the ocean levels are rising now
p288
aVand as they encroach upon the cities, I'll start losing cities here.
p289
aa(lp290
VSo basically, I want the players to be able to experiment and explore
p291
aVa huge amount of failure space.
p292
aVSo there goes one city.
p293
aVNow, over time, this is going to heat up the planet.
p294
aVSo at first what we're going to see
p295
aVis a global ocean rise here on this little toy planet,
p296
aVbut then over time \u2014 I can speed it up \u2014
p297
aVwe'll see the heat impact of that as well.
p298
aa(lp299
VNot only will it get hotter,
p300
aVbut at some point it's going to get so hot the oceans will evaporate.
p301
aVThey'll go up, and then they'll evaporate, and that'll be my planet.
p302
aVSo basically, what we're getting here
p303
aVis the sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth," in about two minutes,
p304
aVand that actually brings up an interesting point about games.
p305
aVNow here, our entire oceans are evaporating off the surface,
p306
aVand as it keeps getting hotter,
p307
aVat some point the entire planet is going to melt down. Here it goes.
p308
aa(lp309
VSo we're not only simulating biological dynamics \u2014
p310
aVfood webs and all that \u2014
p311
aVbut also geologic, you know, on a very simple core scale.
p312
aVAnd what's interesting to me about games
p313
aVis that I think we can take a lot of long-term dynamics
p314
aVand compress them into very short-term experiences.
p315
aVBecause it's so hard for people to think 50 or 100 years out,
p316
aVbut when you can give them a toy,
p317
aVand they can experience these long-term dynamics in just a few minutes,
p318
aVI think it's an entirely different point of view,
p319
aVwhere we're actually using the game to remap our intuition.
p320
aVIt's almost in the same way
p321
aVthat a telescope or microscope recalibrates your eyesight;
p322
aVI think computer simulations can recalibrate your instinct
p323
aVacross vast scales of both space and time.
p324
aa(lp325
VSo here's our little solar system,
p326
aVas we pull away from our melted planet here.
p327
aVWe actually have a couple of other planets in this solar system.
p328
aVLet's fly to another one.
p329
aVWe're going to have this unlimited number of worlds you can explore here.
p330
aVAs we move into the future,
p331
aVand we start going out into space and doing stuff,
p332
aVwe're drawing a lot from things like science fiction.
p333
aVAnd all my favorite science fiction movies
p334
aVI want to play out here as different dynamics.
p335
aa(lp336
VThis planet actually has some life on it.
p337
aVHere it is, some indigenous life down here.
p338
aVOne of the tools I can eventually earn for my UFO
p339
aVis a monolith that I can drop down.
p340
aa(lp341
V(Laughter)
p342
aa(lp343
VNow, as you can see,
p344
aVthese guys are actually starting to go up and bow to it,
p345
aVand over time, once they touch it, they will become intelligent.
p346
aVSo I can actually pick a species on a planet
p347
aVand then make them sentient.
p348
aVNow they've actually gone to tribal dynamics.
p349
aVAnd now, because I'm actually the one here,
p350
aVI can get out of the UFO and walk up,
p351
aVand they should be worshipping me at this point as a god.
p352
aVAt first they're a little freaked out.
p353
aVOK, well maybe they're not worshipping me.
p354
aa(lp355
V(Laughter)
p356
aa(lp357
VI think I'll leave before they get hostile.
p358
aa(lp359
VBut we basically want a diversity of activities
p360
aVthe players can play through this.
p361
aVI want to be able to play
p362
aV"The Day the Earth Stood Still," "2001: A Space Odyssey,"
p363
aV"Star Trek," "War Of the Worlds."
p364
aVNow, as we pull away from this world \u2014
p365
aVwe're going to keep pulling away from the star now.
p366
aVOne of the things that always frustrated me about astronomy
p367
aVwhen I was a kid
p368
aVis how it was always presented so two-dimensionally and so static.
p369
aVAs we pull away from the star here,
p370
aVwe're actually going now out into interstellar space,
p371
aVand we're getting a sense of the space around our home star.
p372
aa(lp373
VWhat I really wanted to do is to present this, basically,
p374
aVas wonderfully 3D as it is actually is.
p375
aVAnd also show the dynamics,
p376
aVand a lot of the interesting objects that you might find, like, in the Hubble,
p377
aVat pretty much realistic frequencies and scales.
p378
aVSo most people have no idea of the difference
p379
aVbetween an emission nebula and a planetary nebula.
p380
aVBut these are the things
p381
aVthat we can put in this little galaxy here.
p382
aVSo we're flying over here to what looks like a black hole.
p383
aVI want to basically have the entire zoo of Hubble objects
p384
aVthat people can interact with and play with, again, as toys.
p385
aa(lp386
VSo here's a little black hole
p387
aVthat we probably don't want to get too close to.
p388
aVBut we also have stars and things as well.
p389
aVIf we pull all the way back, we start seeing the entire galaxy here,
p390
aVkind of slowly in motion.
p391
aVTypically, when people present galaxies,
p392
aVit's always beautiful photos, but they're always static.
p393
aVAnd when you bring it forward in time and start animating it,
p394
aVit's amazing what a galaxy would look like fast forwarded.
p395
aa(lp396
VThis would be about a million years a second,
p397
aVbecause you have about one supernova every century.
p398
aVAnd so you'd have this wonderful sparkling thing,
p399
aVwith the disk slowly rotating,
p400
aVand this is roughly what it would look like.
p401
aVPart of this is about bringing the beauty of the natural world
p402
aVto somebody in a very imaginative way,
p403
aVso that they can start calibrating their instinct
p404
aVacross these vast scales of space and time.
p405
aa(lp406
VChris was wondering what kind of gods the players would become.
p407
aVBecause if you think about it,
p408
aVyou're going to have 15-year-olds, 20-year-olds flying around this universe.
p409
aVThey might be a nurturing god.
p410
aVThey might be bootstrapping life on planets,
p411
aVtrying to terraform and spread civilization.
p412
aVYou might be a vengeful god, conquesting,
p413
aVbecause you actually can do that, you can attack other intelligent races.
p414
aVYou might be a networking god, building alliances,
p415
aVor just curious, going around and wanting to explore as much as you possibly can.
p416
aa(lp417
VBut basically, the reason why I make toys like this
p418
aVis because I think if there's one difference
p419
aVI could possibly make in the world,
p420
aVthat I would choose to make,
p421
aVit's that I would like to somehow give people
p422
aVjust a little bit better calibration on long-term thinking.
p423
aVBecause I think most of the problems that our world is facing right now
p424
aVare the result of short-term thinking,
p425
aVand the fact that it is so hard for us to think 50, 100, or 1,000 years out.
p426
aVAnd I think by giving kids toys like this and letting them replay dynamics,
p427

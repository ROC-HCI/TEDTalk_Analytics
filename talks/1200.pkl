VWe are losing our listening.
p5
aVWe spend roughly 60 percent of our communication time listening,
p6
aVbut we're not very good at it.
p7
aVWe retain just 25 percent of what we hear.
p8
aVNow \u2014 not you, not this talk,
p9
aVbut that is generally true.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VLet's define listening as making meaning from sound.
p14
aVIt's a mental process,
p15
aVand it's a process of extraction.
p16
aa(lp17
VWe use some pretty cool techniques to do this.
p18
aVOne of them is pattern recognition.
p19
aV(Crowd noises) So in a cocktail party like this,
p20
aVif I say, "David, Sara, pay attention" \u2014 some of you just sat up.
p21
aVWe recognize patterns to distinguish noise from signal,
p22
aVand especially our name.
p23
aVDifferencing is another technique we use.
p24
aVIf I left this pink noise on for more than a couple of minutes,
p25
aV(Pink noise) you would literally cease to hear it.
p26
aVWe listen to differences; we discount sounds that remain the same.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd then there is a whole range of filters.
p29
aVThese filters take us from all sound
p30
aVdown to what we pay attention to.
p31
aVMost people are entirely unconscious of these filters.
p32
aVBut they actually create our reality in a way,
p33
aVbecause they tell us what we're paying attention to right now.
p34
aVI'll give you one example of that.
p35
aVIntention is very important in sound, in listening.
p36
aVWhen I married my wife,
p37
aVI promised her I would listen to her every day
p38
aVas if for the first time.
p39
aVNow that's something I fall short of on a daily basis.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VBut it's a great intention to have in a relationship.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VBut that's not all.
p48
aVSound places us in space and in time.
p49
aVIf you close your eyes right now in this room,
p50
aVyou're aware of the size of the room
p51
aVfrom the reverberation and the bouncing of the sound off the surfaces;
p52
aVyou're aware of how many people are around you,
p53
aVbecause of the micro-noises you're receiving.
p54
aVAnd sound places us in time as well,
p55
aVbecause sound always has time embedded in it.
p56
aVIn fact, I would suggest that our listening is the main way
p57
aVthat we experience the flow of time
p58
aVfrom past to future.
p59
aVSo, "Sonority is time and meaning" \u2014 a great quote.
p60
aa(lp61
VI said at the beginning, we're losing our listening.
p62
aVWhy did I say that?
p63
aVWell, there are a lot of reasons for this.
p64
aVFirst of all, we invented ways of recording \u2014
p65
aVfirst writing, then audio recording and now video recording as well.
p66
aVThe premium on accurate and careful listening has simply disappeared.
p67
aVSecondly, the world is now so noisy,
p68
aV(Noise) with this cacophony going on visually and auditorily,
p69
aVit's just hard to listen;
p70
aVit's tiring to listen.
p71
aVMany people take refuge in headphones,
p72
aVbut they turn big, public spaces like this,
p73
aVshared soundscapes,
p74
aVinto millions of tiny, little personal sound bubbles.
p75
aVIn this scenario, nobody's listening to anybody.
p76
aa(lp77
VWe're becoming impatient.
p78
aVWe don't want oratory anymore; we want sound bites.
p79
aVAnd the art of conversation is being replaced \u2014 dangerously, I think \u2014
p80
aVby personal broadcasting.
p81
aVI don't know how much listening there is in this conversation,
p82
aVwhich is sadly very common, especially in the UK.
p83
aVWe're becoming desensitized.
p84
aVOur media have to scream at us with these kinds of headlines
p85
aVin order to get our attention.
p86
aVAnd that means it's harder for us to pay attention
p87
aVto the quiet, the subtle, the understated.
p88
aa(lp89
VThis is a serious problem that we're losing our listening.
p90
aVThis is not trivial,
p91
aVbecause listening is our access to understanding.
p92
aVConscious listening always creates understanding,
p93
aVand only without conscious listening
p94
aVcan these things happen.
p95
aVA world where we don't listen to each other at all
p96
aVis a very scary place indeed.
p97
aVSo I'd like to share with you five simple exercises,
p98
aVtools you can take away with you,
p99
aVto improve your own conscious listening.
p100
aVWould you like that?
p101
aa(lp102
VAudience: Yes!
p103
aa(lp104
VGood. The first one is silence.
p105
aVJust three minutes a day of silence is a wonderful exercise
p106
aVto reset your ears and to recalibrate,
p107
aVso that you can hear the quiet again.
p108
aVIf you can't get absolute silence,
p109
aVgo for quiet, that's absolutely fine.
p110
aa(lp111
VSecond, I call this "the mixer."
p112
aV(Noise) So even if you're in a noisy environment like this \u2014
p113
aVand we all spend a lot of time in places like this \u2014
p114
aVlisten in the coffee bar to how many channels of sound can I hear?
p115
aVHow many individual channels in that mix am I listening to?
p116
aVYou can do it in a beautiful place as well, like in a lake.
p117
aVHow many birds am I hearing?
p118
aVWhere are they? Where are those ripples?
p119
aVIt's a great exercise for improving the quality of your listening.
p120
aa(lp121
VThird, this exercise I call "savoring," and this is a beautiful exercise.
p122
aVIt's about enjoying mundane sounds.
p123
aVThis, for example, is my tumble dryer.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Dryer)
p126
aa(lp127
VIt's a waltz \u2014 one, two, three; one, two, three; one, two, three.
p128
aVI love it!
p129
aVOr just try this one on for size.
p130
aa(lp131
V(Coffee grinder)
p132
aa(lp133
VWow!
p134
aVSo, mundane sounds can be really interesting \u2014
p135
aVif you pay attention.
p136
aVI call that the "hidden choir" \u2014 it's around us all the time.
p137
aa(lp138
VThe next exercise is probably the most important of all of these,
p139
aVif you just take one thing away.
p140
aVThis is listening positions \u2014
p141
aVthe idea that you can move your listening position
p142
aVto what's appropriate to what you're listening to.
p143
aVThis is playing with those filters.
p144
aVRemember I gave you those filters?
p145
aVIt's starting to play with them as levers,
p146
aVto get conscious about them and to move to different places.
p147
aVThese are just some of the listening positions,
p148
aVor scales of listening positions, that you can use.
p149
aVThere are many.
p150
aVHave fun with that. It's very exciting.
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd finally, an acronym.
p153
aVYou can use this in listening, in communication.
p154
aVIf you're in any one of those roles \u2014
p155
aVand I think that probably is everybody who's listening to this talk \u2014
p156
aVthe acronym is RASA,
p157
aVwhich is the Sanskrit word for "juice" or "essence."
p158
aVAnd RASA stands for "Receive," which means pay attention to the person;
p159
aV"Appreciate," making little noises like "hmm," "oh," "OK";
p160
aV"Summarize" \u2014 the word "so" is very important in communication;
p161
aVand "Ask," ask questions afterwards.
p162
aa(lp163
VNow sound is my passion, it's my life.
p164
aVI wrote a whole book about it. So I live to listen.
p165
aVThat's too much to ask for most people.
p166
aVBut I believe that every human being needs to listen consciously
p167
aVin order to live fully \u2014
p168
aVconnected in space and in time to the physical world around us,
p169
aVconnected in understanding to each other,
p170
aVnot to mention spiritually connected,
p171
aVbecause every spiritual path I know of has listening and contemplation
p172
aVat its heart.
p173
aa(lp174
VThat's why we need to teach listening in our schools as a skill.
p175
aVWhy is it not taught? It's crazy.
p176
aVAnd if we can teach listening in our schools,
p177
aVwe can take our listening off that slippery slope
p178
aVto that dangerous, scary world that I talked about,
p179
aVand move it to a place where everybody is consciously listening all the time,
p180
aVor at least capable of doing it.
p181
aa(lp182
VNow, I don't know how to do that,
p183
aVbut this is TED,
p184
aVand I think the TED community is capable of anything.
p185
aVSo I invite you to connect with me, connect with each other,
p186
aVtake this mission out.
p187
aVAnd let's get listening taught in schools,
p188
aVand transform the world in one generation
p189
aVto a conscious, listening world \u2014 a world of connection,
p190
aVa world of understanding
p191
aVand a world of peace.
p192
aa(lp193
VThank you for listening to me today.

aa(lp195
V(Applause)

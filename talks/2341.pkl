VRaise your hand if you've ever been asked the question
p5
aV"What do you want to be when you grow up?"
p6
aa(lp7
VNow if you had to guess,
p8
aVhow old would you say you were when you were first asked this question?
p9
aVYou can just hold up fingers.
p10
aVThree. Five. Three. Five. Five. OK.
p11
aVNow, raise your hand if the question
p12
aV"What do you want to be when you grow up?"
p13
aVhas ever caused you any anxiety.
p14
aa(lp15
V(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VAny anxiety at all.
p18
aa(lp19
VI'm someone who's never been able to answer the question
p20
aV"What do you want to be when you grow up?"
p21
aa(lp22
VSee, the problem wasn't that I didn't have any interests \u2014
p23
aVit's that I had too many.
p24
aVIn high school, I liked English and math and art and I built websites
p25
aVand I played guitar in a punk band called Frustrated Telephone Operator.
p26
aVMaybe you've heard of us.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VThis continued after high school,
p31
aVand at a certain point, I began to notice this pattern in myself
p32
aVwhere I would become interested in an area
p33
aVand I would dive in, become all-consumed,
p34
aVand I'd get to be pretty good at whatever it was,
p35
aVand then I would hit this point where I'd start to get bored.
p36
aVAnd usually I would try and persist anyway,
p37
aVbecause I had already devoted so much time and energy
p38
aVand sometimes money into this field.
p39
aVBut eventually this sense of boredom,
p40
aVthis feeling of, like, yeah, I got this, this isn't challenging anymore \u2014
p41
aVit would get to be too much.
p42
aVAnd I would have to let it go.
p43
aa(lp44
VBut then I would become interested in something else,
p45
aVsomething totally unrelated, and I would dive into that,
p46
aVand become all-consumed, and I'd be like, "Yes! I found my thing,"
p47
aVand then I would hit this point again where I'd start to get bored.
p48
aVAnd eventually, I would let it go.
p49
aVBut then I would discover something new and totally different,
p50
aVand I would dive into that.
p51
aa(lp52
VThis pattern caused me a lot of anxiety,
p53
aVfor two reasons.
p54
aVThe first was that I wasn't sure
p55
aVhow I was going to turn any of this into a career.
p56
aVI thought that I would eventually have to pick one thing,
p57
aVdeny all of my other passions,
p58
aVand just resign myself to being bored.
p59
aVThe other reason it caused me so much anxiety
p60
aVwas a little bit more personal.
p61
aVI worried that there was something wrong with this,
p62
aVand something wrong with me for being unable to stick with anything.
p63
aVI worried that I was afraid of commitment,
p64
aVor that I was scattered, or that I was self-sabotaging,
p65
aVafraid of my own success.
p66
aa(lp67
VIf you can relate to my story and to these feelings,
p68
aVI'd like you to ask yourself a question
p69
aVthat I wish I had asked myself back then.
p70
aVAsk yourself where you learned to assign the meaning of wrong or abnormal
p71
aVto doing many things.
p72
aVI'll tell you where you learned it:
p73
aVyou learned it from the culture.
p74
aa(lp75
VWe are first asked the question "What do you want to be when you grow up?"
p76
aVwhen we're about five years old.
p77
aVAnd the truth is that no one really cares what you say when you're that age.
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VIt's considered an innocuous question,
p82
aVposed to little kids to elicit cute replies,
p83
aVlike, "I want to be an astronaut," or "I want to be a ballerina,"
p84
aVor "I want to be a pirate."
p85
aVInsert Halloween costume here.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VBut this question gets asked of us again and again as we get older
p90
aVin various forms \u2014 for instance, high school students might get asked
p91
aVwhat major they're going to pick in college.
p92
aVAnd at some point,
p93
aV"What do you want to be when you grow up?"
p94
aVgoes from being the cute exercise it once was
p95
aVto the thing that keeps us up at night.
p96
aVWhy?
p97
aa(lp98
VSee, while this question inspires kids to dream about what they could be,
p99
aVit does not inspire them to dream about all that they could be.
p100
aVIn fact, it does just the opposite,
p101
aVbecause when someone asks you what you want to be,
p102
aVyou can't reply with 20 different things,
p103
aVthough well-meaning adults will likely chuckle and be like,
p104
aV"Oh, how cute, but you can't be a violin maker and a psychologist.
p105
aVYou have to choose."
p106
aa(lp107
VThis is Dr. Bob Childs \u2014
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
Vand he's a luthier and psychotherapist.
p112
aVAnd this is Amy Ng, a magazine editor turned illustrator, entrepreneur,
p113
aVteacher and creative director.
p114
aVBut most kids don't hear about people like this.
p115
aVAll they hear
p116
aVis that they're going to have to choose.
p117
aVBut it's more than that.
p118
aVThe notion of the narrowly focused life
p119
aVis highly romanticized in our culture.
p120
aVIt's this idea of destiny or the one true calling,
p121
aVthe idea that we each have one great thing
p122
aVwe are meant to do during our time on this earth,
p123
aVand you need to figure out what that thing is
p124
aVand devote your life to it.
p125
aa(lp126
VBut what if you're someone who isn't wired this way?
p127
aVWhat if there are a lot of different subjects that you're curious about,
p128
aVand many different things you want to do?
p129
aVWell, there is no room for someone like you in this framework.
p130
aVAnd so you might feel alone.
p131
aVYou might feel like you don't have a purpose.
p132
aVAnd you might feel like there's something wrong with you.
p133
aVThere's nothing wrong with you.
p134
aVWhat you are is a multipotentialite.
p135
aa(lp136
V(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
V(Applause)
p139
aa(lp140
VA multipotentialite is someone with many interests and creative pursuits.
p141
aVIt's a mouthful to say.
p142
aVIt might help if you break it up into three parts:
p143
aVmulti, potential, and ite.
p144
aVYou can also use one of the other terms that connote the same idea,
p145
aVsuch as polymath, the Renaissance person.
p146
aVActually, during the Renaissance period,
p147
aVit was considered the ideal to be well-versed in multiple disciplines.
p148
aVBarbara Sher refers to us as "scanners."
p149
aVUse whichever term you like, or invent your own.
p150
aVI have to say I find it sort of fitting that as a community,
p151
aVwe cannot agree on a single identity.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VIt's easy to see your multipotentiality
p156
aVas a limitation or an affliction that you need to overcome.
p157
aVBut what I've learned through speaking with people
p158
aVand writing about these ideas on my website,
p159
aVis that there are some tremendous strengths to being this way.
p160
aVHere are three
p161
aVmultipotentialite super powers.
p162
aa(lp163
VOne: idea synthesis.
p164
aVThat is, combining two or more fields
p165
aVand creating something new at the intersection.
p166
aVSha Hwang and Rachel Binx drew from their shared interests
p167
aVin cartography, data visualization, travel, mathematics and design,
p168
aVwhen they founded Meshu.
p169
aVMeshu is a company that creates custom geographically-inspired jewelry.
p170
aVSha and Rachel came up with this unique idea
p171
aVnot despite, but because of their eclectic mix of skills and experiences.
p172
aVInnovation happens at the intersections.
p173
aVThat's where the new ideas come from.
p174
aVAnd multipotentialites, with all of their backgrounds,
p175
aVare able to access a lot of these points of intersection.
p176
aa(lp177
VThe second multipotentialite superpower
p178
aVis rapid learning.
p179
aVWhen multipotentialites become interested in something,
p180
aVwe go hard.
p181
aVWe observe everything we can get our hands on.
p182
aVWe're also used to being beginners,
p183
aVbecause we've been beginners so many times in the past,
p184
aVand this means that we're less afraid of trying new things
p185
aVand stepping out of our comfort zones.
p186
aVWhat's more, many skills are transferable across disciplines,
p187
aVand we bring everything we've learned to every new area we pursue,
p188
aVso we're rarely starting from scratch.
p189
aa(lp190
VNora Dunn is a full-time traveler and freelance writer.
p191
aVAs a child concert pianist, she honed an incredible ability
p192
aVto develop muscle memory.
p193
aVNow, she's the fastest typist she knows.
p194
aa(lp195
V(Laughter)
p196
aa(lp197
VBefore becoming a writer, Nora was a financial planner.
p198
aVShe had to learn the finer mechanics of sales
p199
aVwhen she was starting her practice,
p200
aVand this skill now helps her write compelling pitches to editors.
p201
aVIt is rarely a waste of time to pursue something you're drawn to,
p202
aVeven if you end up quitting.
p203
aVYou might apply that knowledge in a different field entirely,
p204
aVin a way that you couldn't have anticipated.
p205
aa(lp206
VThe third multipotentialite superpower
p207
aVis adaptability;
p208
aVthat is, the ability to morph into whatever you need to be
p209
aVin a given situation.
p210
aVAbe Cajudo is sometimes a video director, sometimes a web designer,
p211
aVsometimes a Kickstarter consultant, sometimes a teacher,
p212
aVand sometimes, apparently, James Bond.
p213
aa(lp214
V(Laughter)
p215
aa(lp216
VHe's valuable because he does good work.
p217
aVHe's even more valuable because he can take on various roles,
p218
aVdepending on his clients' needs.
p219
aVFast Company magazine identified adaptability
p220
aVas the single most important skill to develop in order to thrive
p221
aVin the 21st century.
p222
aVThe economic world is changing so quickly and unpredictably
p223
aVthat it is the individuals and organizations that can pivot
p224
aVin order to meet the needs of the market that are really going to thrive.
p225
aa(lp226
VIdea synthesis, rapid learning and adaptability:
p227
aVthree skills that multipotentialites are very adept at,
p228
aVand three skills that they might lose if pressured to narrow their focus.
p229
aVAs a society, we have a vested interest in encouraging multipotentialites
p230
aVto be themselves.
p231
aVWe have a lot of complex, multidimensional problems in the world right now,
p232
aVand we need creative, out-of-the-box thinkers to tackle them.
p233
aa(lp234
VNow, let's say that you are, in your heart, a specialist.
p235
aVYou came out of the womb knowing you wanted to be a pediatric neurosurgeon.
p236
aVDon't worry \u2014 there's nothing wrong with you, either.
p237
aa(lp238
V(Laughter)
p239
aa(lp240
VIn fact, some of the best teams are comprised of a specialist
p241
aVand multipotentialite paired together.
p242
aVThe specialist can dive in deep and implement ideas,
p243
aVwhile the multipotentialite brings a breadth of knowledge to the project.
p244
aVIt's a beautiful partnership.
p245
aVBut we should all be designing lives and careers
p246
aVthat are aligned with how we're wired.
p247
aVAnd sadly, multipotentialites are largely being encouraged
p248
aVsimply to be more like their specialist peers.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo with that said,
p251
aVif there is one thing you take away from this talk,
p252
aVI hope that it is this:
p253
aVembrace your inner wiring, whatever that may be.
p254
aVIf you're a specialist at heart,
p255
aVthen by all means, specialize.
p256
aVThat is where you'll do your best work.
p257
aVBut to the multipotentialites in the room,
p258
aVincluding those of you who may have just realized
p259
aVin the last 12 minutes that you are one \u2014
p260
aa(lp261
V(Laughter)
p262
aa(lp263
Vto you I say:
p264
aVembrace your many passions.
p265
aVFollow your curiosity down those rabbit holes.
p266
aVExplore your intersections.
p267
aVEmbracing our inner wiring leads to a happier, more authentic life.
p268
aVAnd perhaps more importantly \u2014
p269
aVmultipotentialites, the world needs us.
p270
aa(lp271
VThank you.
p272
aa(lp273
V(Applause)

VIn the last 50 years,
p5
aVwe've been building the suburbs
p6
aVwith a lot of unintended consequences.
p7
aVAnd I'm going to talk about some of those consequences
p8
aVand just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects
p9
aVthat I think give us tremendous reasons
p10
aVto be really optimistic
p11
aVthat the big design and development project of the next 50 years
p12
aVis going to be retrofitting suburbia.
p13
aVSo whether it's redeveloping dying malls
p14
aVor re-inhabiting dead big-box stores
p15
aVor reconstructing wetlands
p16
aVout of parking lots,
p17
aVI think the fact is
p18
aVthe growing number
p19
aVof empty and under-performing,
p20
aVespecially retail, sites
p21
aVthroughout suburbia
p22
aVgives us actually a tremendous opportunity
p23
aVto take our least-sustainable
p24
aVlandscapes right now
p25
aVand convert them into
p26
aVmore sustainable places.
p27
aVAnd in the process, what that allows us to do
p28
aVis to redirect a lot more of our growth
p29
aVback into existing communities
p30
aVthat could use a boost,
p31
aVand have the infrastructure in place,
p32
aVinstead of continuing
p33
aVto tear down trees
p34
aVand to tear up the green space out at the edges.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo why is this important?
p37
aVI think there are any number of reasons,
p38
aVand I'm just going to not get into detail but mention a few.
p39
aVJust from the perspective of climate change,
p40
aVthe average urban dweller in the U.S.
p41
aVhas about one-third the carbon footprint
p42
aVof the average suburban dweller,
p43
aVmostly because suburbanites drive a lot more,
p44
aVand living in detached buildings,
p45
aVyou have that much more exterior surface
p46
aVto leak energy out of.
p47
aVSo strictly from
p48
aVa climate change perspective,
p49
aVthe cities are already
p50
aVrelatively green.
p51
aVThe big opportunity
p52
aVto reduce greenhouse gas emissions
p53
aVis actually in urbanizing
p54
aVthe suburbs.
p55
aVAll that driving that we've been doing out in the suburbs,
p56
aVwe have doubled the amount of miles we drive.
p57
aVIt's increased our dependence
p58
aVon foreign oil
p59
aVdespite the gains in fuel efficiency.
p60
aVWe're just driving so much more;
p61
aVwe haven't been able to keep up technologically.
p62
aa(lp63
VPublic health is another reason
p64
aVto consider retrofitting.
p65
aVResearchers at the CDC and other places
p66
aVhave increasingly been linking
p67
aVsuburban development patterns
p68
aVwith sedentary lifestyles.
p69
aVAnd those have been linked then
p70
aVwith the rather alarming,
p71
aVgrowing rates of obesity,
p72
aVshown in these maps here,
p73
aVand that obesity has also been triggering
p74
aVgreat increases in heart disease
p75
aVand diabetes
p76
aVto the point where a child born today
p77
aVhas a one-in-three chance
p78
aVof developing diabetes.
p79
aVAnd that rate has been escalating at the same rate
p80
aVas children not walking
p81
aVto school anymore,
p82
aVagain, because of our development patterns.
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd then there's finally \u2014 there's the affordability question.
p85
aVI mean, how affordable is it
p86
aVto continue to live in suburbia
p87
aVwith rising gas prices?
p88
aVSuburban expansion to cheap land,
p89
aVfor the last 50 years \u2014
p90
aVyou know the cheap land out on the edge \u2014
p91
aVhas helped generations of families
p92
aVenjoy the American dream.
p93
aVBut increasingly,
p94
aVthe savings promised
p95
aVby drive-till-you-qualify affordability \u2014
p96
aVwhich is basically our model \u2014
p97
aVthose savings are wiped out
p98
aVwhen you consider the transportation costs.
p99
aVFor instance, here in Atlanta,
p100
aVabout half of households
p101
aVmake between $20,000 and $50,000 a year,
p102
aVand they are spending 29 percent of their income
p103
aVon housing
p104
aVand 32 percent
p105
aVon transportation.
p106
aVI mean, that's 2005 figures.
p107
aVThat's before we got up to the four bucks a gallon.
p108
aVYou know, none of us
p109
aVreally tend to do the math on our transportation costs,
p110
aVand they're not going down
p111
aVany time soon.
p112
aa(lp113
VWhether you love suburbia's leafy privacy
p114
aVor you hate its soulless commercial strips,
p115
aVthere are reasons why it's important to retrofit.
p116
aVBut is it practical?
p117
aVI think it is.
p118
aVJune Williamson and I have been researching this topic
p119
aVfor over a decade,
p120
aVand we've found over 80
p121
aVvaried projects.
p122
aVBut that they're really all market driven,
p123
aVand what's driving the market in particular \u2014
p124
aVnumber one \u2014 is major demographic shifts.
p125
aVWe all tend to think of suburbia
p126
aVas this very family-focused place,
p127
aVbut that's really not the case anymore.
p128
aVSince 2000,
p129
aValready two-thirds of households in suburbia
p130
aVdid not have kids in them.
p131
aVWe just haven't caught up with the actual realities of this.
p132
aVThe reasons for this have a lot to with
p133
aVthe dominance of the two big
p134
aVdemographic groups right now:
p135
aVthe Baby Boomers retiring \u2014
p136
aVand then there's a gap,
p137
aVGeneration X, which is a small generation.
p138
aVThey're still having kids \u2014
p139
aVbut Generation Y hasn't even started
p140
aVhitting child-rearing age.
p141
aVThey're the other big generation.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo as a result of that,
p144
aVdemographers predict
p145
aVthat through 2025,
p146
aV75 to 85 percent of new households
p147
aVwill not have kids in them.
p148
aVAnd the market research, consumer research,
p149
aVasking the Boomers and Gen Y
p150
aVwhat it is they would like,
p151
aVwhat they would like to live in,
p152
aVtells us there is going to be a huge demand \u2014
p153
aVand we're already seeing it \u2014
p154
aVfor more urban lifestyles
p155
aVwithin suburbia.
p156
aVThat basically, the Boomers want to be able to age in place,
p157
aVand Gen Y would like to live
p158
aVan urban lifestyle,
p159
aVbut most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia.
p160
aa(lp161
VThe other big dynamic of change
p162
aVis the sheer performance of
p163
aVunderperforming asphalt.
p164
aVNow I keep thinking this would be a great name
p165
aVfor an indie rock band,
p166
aVbut developers generally use it
p167
aVto refer to underused parking lots \u2014
p168
aVand suburbia is full of them.
p169
aVWhen the postwar suburbs were first built
p170
aVout on the cheap land
p171
aVaway from downtown,
p172
aVit made sense to just build
p173
aVsurface parking lots.
p174
aVBut those sites have now been leapfrogged
p175
aVand leapfrogged again,
p176
aVas we've just continued to sprawl,
p177
aVand they now have
p178
aVa relatively central location.
p179
aVIt no longer just makes sense.
p180
aVThat land is more valuable than just surface parking lots.
p181
aVIt now makes sense to go back in,
p182
aVbuild a deck and build up
p183
aVon those sites.
p184
aVSo what do you do
p185
aVwith a dead mall,
p186
aVdead office park?
p187
aVIt turns out, all sorts of things.
p188
aVIn a slow economy like ours,
p189
aVre-inhabitation is
p190
aVone of the more popular strategies.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo this happens to be
p193
aVa dead mall in St. Louis
p194
aVthat's been re-inhabited as art-space.
p195
aVIt's now home to artist studios,
p196
aVtheater groups, dance troupes.
p197
aVIt's not pulling in as much tax revenue
p198
aVas it once was,
p199
aVbut it's serving its community.
p200
aVIt's keeping the lights on.
p201
aVIt's becoming, I think, a really great institution.
p202
aVOther malls have been re-inhabited
p203
aVas nursing homes,
p204
aVas universities,
p205
aVand as all variety of office space.
p206
aVWe also found a lot of examples
p207
aVof dead big-box stores
p208
aVthat have been converted into
p209
aVall sorts of community-serving uses as well \u2014
p210
aVlots of schools, lots of churches
p211
aVand lots of libraries like this one.
p212
aa(lp213
VThis was a little grocery store, a Food Lion grocery store,
p214
aVthat is now a public library.
p215
aVIn addition to, I think, doing a beautiful adaptive reuse,
p216
aVthey tore up some of the parking spaces,
p217
aVput in bioswales to collect and clean the runoff,
p218
aVput in a lot more sidewalks
p219
aVto connect to the neighborhoods.
p220
aVAnd they've made this,
p221
aVwhat was just a store along a commercial strip,
p222
aVinto a community gathering space.
p223
aVThis one is a little L-shaped strip shopping center
p224
aVin Phoenix, Arizona.
p225
aVReally all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint,
p226
aVa gourmet grocery,
p227
aVand they put up a restaurant in the old post office.
p228
aVNever underestimate the power of food
p229
aVto turn a place around
p230
aVand make it a destination.
p231
aVIt's been so successful, they've now taken over the strip across the street.
p232
aVThe real estate ads in the neighborhood
p233
aVall very proudly proclaim,
p234
aV"Walking distance to Le Grande Orange,"
p235
aVbecause it provided its neighborhood
p236
aVwith what sociologists like to call
p237
aV"a third place."
p238
aVIf home is the first place
p239
aVand work is the second place,
p240
aVthe third place is where you go to hang out
p241
aVand build community.
p242
aVAnd especially as suburbia is becoming
p243
aVless centered on the family,
p244
aVthe family households,
p245
aVthere's a real hunger
p246
aVfor more third places.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo the most dramatic retrofits
p249
aVare really those in the next category,
p250
aVthe next strategy: redevelopment.
p251
aVNow, during the boom, there were several
p252
aVreally dramatic redevelopment projects
p253
aVwhere the original building
p254
aVwas scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt
p255
aVat significantly greater density,
p256
aVa sort of compact, walkable urban neighborhoods.
p257
aVBut some of them have been much more incremental.
p258
aVThis is Mashpee Commons,
p259
aVthe oldest retrofit that we've found.
p260
aVAnd it's just incrementally, over the last 20 years,
p261
aVbuilt urbanism
p262
aVon top of its parking lots.
p263
aVSo the black and white photo shows
p264
aVthe simple 60's strip shopping center.
p265
aVAnd then the maps above that
p266
aVshow its gradual transformation
p267
aVinto a compact,
p268
aVmixed-use New England village,
p269
aVand it has plans now that have been approved
p270
aVfor it to connect
p271
aVto new residential neighborhoods
p272
aVacross the arterials
p273
aVand over to the other side.
p274
aVSo, you know, sometimes it's incremental.
p275
aVSometimes, it's all at once.
p276
aa(lp277
VThis is another infill project on the parking lots,
p278
aVthis one of an office park outside of Washington D.C.
p279
aVWhen Metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs
p280
aVand opened a station nearby to this site,
p281
aVthe owners decided
p282
aVto build a new parking deck
p283
aVand then insert on top of their surface lots
p284
aVa new Main Street, several apartments
p285
aVand condo buildings,
p286
aVwhile keeping the existing office buildings.
p287
aVHere is the site in 1940:
p288
aVIt was just a little farm
p289
aVin the village of Hyattsville.
p290
aVBy 1980, it had been subdivided
p291
aVinto a big mall on one side
p292
aVand the office park on the other
p293
aVand then some buffer sites for a library
p294
aVand a church to the far right.
p295
aVToday, the transit,
p296
aVthe Main Street and the new housing
p297
aVhave all been built.
p298
aVEventually, I expect that the streets
p299
aVwill probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall.
p300
aVPlans have already been announced
p301
aVfor a lot of those garden apartments
p302
aVabove the mall to be redeveloped.
p303
aVTransit is a big driver of retrofits.
p304
aVSo here's what it looks like.
p305
aVYou can sort of see the funky new condo buildings
p306
aVin between the office buildings
p307
aVand the public space and the new Main Street.
p308
aa(lp309
VThis one is one of my favorites, Belmar.
p310
aVI think they really built an attractive place here
p311
aVand have just employed all-green construction.
p312
aVThere's massive P.V. arrays on the roofs
p313
aVas well as wind turbines.
p314
aVThis was a very large mall
p315
aVon a hundred-acre superblock.
p316
aVIt's now 22
p317
aVwalkable urban blocks
p318
aVwith public streets,
p319
aVtwo public parks, eight bus lines
p320
aVand a range of housing types,
p321
aVand so it's really given Lakewood, Colorado
p322
aVthe downtown
p323
aVthat this particular suburb never had.
p324
aVHere was the mall in its heyday.
p325
aVThey had their prom in the mall. They loved their mall.
p326
aVSo here's the site in 1975
p327
aVwith the mall.
p328
aVBy 1995, the mall has died.
p329
aVThe department store has been kept \u2014
p330
aVand we found this was true in many cases.
p331
aVThe department stores are multistory; they're better built.
p332
aVThey're easy to be re-adapted.
p333
aVBut the one story stuff ...
p334
aVthat's really history.
p335
aa(lp336
VSo here it is at projected build-out.
p337
aVThis project, I think, has great connectivity
p338
aVto the existing neighborhoods.
p339
aVIt's providing 1,500 households with the option
p340
aVof a more urban lifestyle.
p341
aVIt's about two-thirds built out right now.
p342
aVHere's what the new Main Street looks like.
p343
aVIt's very successful,
p344
aVand it's helped to prompt \u2014
p345
aVeight of the 13
p346
aVregional malls in Denver
p347
aVhave now, or have announced plans to
p348
aVbe, retrofitted.
p349
aVBut it's important to note that all of this retrofitting
p350
aVis not occurring \u2014
p351
aVjust bulldozers are coming and just plowing down the whole city.
p352
aVNo, it's pockets of walkability
p353
aVon the sites of
p354
aVunder-performing properties.
p355
aVAnd so it's giving people more choices,
p356
aVbut it's not taking away choices.
p357
aa(lp358
VBut it's also not really enough
p359
aVto just create pockets of walkability.
p360
aVYou want to also try to get more systemic transformation.
p361
aVWe need to also retrofit the corridors themselves.
p362
aVSo this is one that has been
p363
aVretrofitted in California.
p364
aVThey took the commercial strip
p365
aVshown on the black-and-white images below,
p366
aVand they built a boulevard
p367
aVthat has become the Main Street for their town.
p368
aVAnd it's transformed from being
p369
aVan ugly, unsafe,
p370
aVundesirable address,
p371
aVto becoming a beautiful,
p372
aVattractive, dignified sort of good address.
p373
aVI mean now we're hoping we start to see it;
p374
aVthey've already built City Hall, attracted two hotels.
p375
aVI could imagine beautiful housing going up along there
p376
aVwithout tearing down another tree.
p377
aVSo there's a lot of great things,
p378
aVbut I'd love to see more corridors getting retrofitting.
p379
aa(lp380
VBut densification
p381
aVis not going to work everywhere.
p382
aVSometimes re-greening
p383
aVis really the better answer.
p384
aVThere's a lot to learn from successful
p385
aVlandbanking programs
p386
aVin cities like Flint, Michigan.
p387
aVThere's also a burgeoning suburban farming movement \u2014
p388
aVsort of victory gardens meets the Internet.
p389
aVBut perhaps one of the most important re-greening aspects
p390
aVis the opportunity to restore
p391
aVthe local ecology,
p392
aVas in this example outside of Minneapolis.
p393
aVWhen the shopping center died,
p394
aVthe city restored the site's
p395
aVoriginal wetlands,
p396
aVcreating lakefront property,
p397
aVwhich then attracted private investment,
p398
aVthe first private investment to this very low-income neighborhood
p399
aVin over 40 years.
p400
aVSo they've managed to both restore the local ecology
p401
aVand the local economy at the same time.
p402
aVThis is another re-greening example.
p403
aVIt also makes sense in very strong markets.
p404
aVThis one in Seattle
p405
aVis on the site of a mall parking lot
p406
aVadjacent to a new transit stop.
p407
aVAnd the wavy line
p408
aVis a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit.
p409
aVThe creek had been culverted under the parking lot.
p410
aVBut daylighting our creeks
p411
aVreally improves their water quality
p412
aVand contributions to habitat.
p413
aa(lp414
VSo I've shown you some of
p415
aVthe first generation of retrofits.
p416
aVWhat's next?
p417
aVI think we have three challenges for the future.
p418
aVThe first is to plan retrofitting
p419
aVmuch more systemically
p420
aVat the metropolitan scale.
p421
aVWe need to be able to target
p422
aVwhich areas really should be re-greened.
p423
aVWhere should we be redeveloping?
p424
aVAnd where should we be encouraging re-inhabitation?
p425
aVThese slides just show two images
p426
aVfrom a larger project
p427
aVthat looked at trying to do that for Atlanta.
p428
aVI led a team that was asked to imagine
p429
aVAtlanta 100 years from now.
p430
aVAnd we chose to try to reverse sprawl
p431
aVthrough three simple moves \u2014 expensive, but simple.
p432
aVOne, in a hundred years,
p433
aVtransit on all major
p434
aVrail and road corridors.
p435
aVTwo, in a hundred years,
p436
aVthousand foot buffers
p437
aVon all stream corridors.
p438
aVIt's a little extreme, but we've got a little water problem.
p439
aVIn a hundred years,
p440
aVsubdivisions that simply end up too close to water
p441
aVor too far from transit won't be viable.
p442
aVAnd so we've created the eco-acre
p443
aVtransfer-to-transfer development rights
p444
aVto the transit corridors
p445
aVand allow the re-greening
p446
aVof those former subdivisions
p447
aVfor food and energy production.
p448
aa(lp449
VSo the second challenge
p450
aVis to improve the architectural design quality
p451
aVof the retrofits.
p452
aVAnd I close with this image
p453
aVof democracy in action:
p454
aVThis is a protest that's happening
p455
aVon a retrofit in Silver Spring, Maryland
p456
aVon an Astroturf town green.
p457
aVNow, retrofits are often accused
p458
aVof being examples of faux downtowns
p459
aVand instant urbanism,
p460
aVand not without reason; you don't get much more phony
p461
aVthan an Astroturf town green.
p462
aVI have to say, these are very hybrid places.
p463
aVThey are new but trying to look old.
p464
aVThey have urban streetscapes,
p465
aVbut suburban parking ratios.
p466
aVTheir populations are
p467
aVmore diverse than typical suburbia,
p468
aVbut they're less diverse than cities.
p469
aVAnd they are
p470
aVpublic places,
p471
aVbut that are managed by private companies.
p472
aVAnd just the surface appearance
p473
aVare often \u2014 like the Astroturf here \u2014
p474
aVthey make me wince.
p475
aVSo, you know, I mean I'm glad that
p476
aVthe urbanism is doing its job.
p477
aVThe fact that a protest is happening
p478
aVreally does mean
p479
aVthat the layout of the blocks, the streets and blocks, the putting in of public space,
p480
aVcompromised as it may be,
p481
aVis still a really great thing.
p482
aVBut we've got to get the architecture better.
p483
aa(lp484
VThe final challenge is for all of you.
p485
aVI want you to join the protest
p486
aVand start demanding
p487
aVmore sustainable suburban places \u2014
p488
aVmore sustainable places, period.
p489
aVBut culturally,
p490
aVwe tend to think that downtowns
p491

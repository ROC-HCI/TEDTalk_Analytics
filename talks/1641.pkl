VSo I'd like to start by focusing on
p5
aVthe world's most dangerous animal.
p6
aa(lp7
VNow, when you talk about dangerous animals,
p8
aVmost people might think of lions or tigers or sharks.
p9
aVBut of course the most dangerous animal
p10
aVis the mosquito.
p11
aVThe mosquito has killed more humans
p12
aVthan any other creature in human history.
p13
aVIn fact, probably adding them all together,
p14
aVthe mosquito has killed more humans.
p15
aVAnd the mosquito has killed more humans than wars
p16
aVand plague.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd you would think, would you not,
p19
aVthat with all our science, with all our advances in society,
p20
aVwith better towns, better civilizations, better sanitation,
p21
aVwealth, that we would get better at controlling mosquitos,
p22
aVand hence reduce this disease.
p23
aVAnd that's not really the case.
p24
aVIf it was the case, we wouldn't have
p25
aVbetween 200 and 300 million cases of malaria every year,
p26
aVand we wouldn't have
p27
aVa million and a half deaths from malaria,
p28
aVand we wouldn't have a disease
p29
aVthat was relatively unknown 50 years ago
p30
aVnow suddenly turned into
p31
aVthe largest mosquito-borne virus threat that we have,
p32
aVand that's called dengue fever.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo 50 years ago, pretty much no one had heard of it,
p35
aVno one certainly in the European environment.
p36
aVBut dengue fever now, according to the World Health Organization,
p37
aVinfects between 50 and 100 million people every year,
p38
aVso that's equivalent to the whole of the population
p39
aVof the U.K. being infected every year.
p40
aVOther estimates put that number at roughly double
p41
aVthat number of infections.
p42
aVAnd dengue fever has grown in speed quite phenomenally.
p43
aVIn the last 50 years, the incidence of dengue
p44
aVhas grown thirtyfold.
p45
aa(lp46
VNow let me tell you a little bit about what dengue fever is,
p47
aVfor those who don't know.
p48
aVNow let's assume you go on holiday.
p49
aVLet's assume you go to the Caribbean,
p50
aVor you might go to Mexico. You might go to Latin America,
p51
aVAsia, Africa, anywhere in Saudi Arabia.
p52
aVYou might go to India, the Far East.
p53
aVIt doesn't really matter. It's the same mosquito,
p54
aVand it's the same disease. You're at risk.
p55
aVAnd let's assume you're bitten by a mosquito
p56
aVthat's carrying that virus.
p57
aVWell, you could develop flu-like symptoms.
p58
aVThey could be quite mild.
p59
aVYou could develop nausea, headache,
p60
aVyour muscles could feel like they're contracting,
p61
aVand you could actually feel like your bones are breaking.
p62
aVAnd that's the nickname given to this disease.
p63
aVIt's called breakbone fever,
p64
aVbecause that's how you can feel.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow the odd thing is, is that once you've been bitten
p67
aVby this mosquito, and you've had this disease,
p68
aVyour body develops antibodies,
p69
aVso if you're bitten again with that strain,
p70
aVit doesn't affect you.
p71
aVBut it's not one virus, it's four,
p72
aVand the same protection that gives you the antibodies
p73
aVand protects you from the same virus that you had before
p74
aVactually makes you much more susceptible to the other three.
p75
aVSo the next time you get dengue fever,
p76
aVif it's a different strain, you're more susceptible,
p77
aVyou're likely to get worse symptoms,
p78
aVand you're more likely to get the more severe forms,
p79
aVhemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome.
p80
aVSo you don't want dengue once,
p81
aVand you certainly don't want it again.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo why is it spreading so fast?
p84
aVAnd the answer is this thing.
p85
aVThis is Aedes aegypti.
p86
aVNow this is a mosquito that came, like its name suggests,
p87
aVout of North Africa, and it's spread round the world.
p88
aVNow, in fact, a single mosquito will only travel
p89
aVabout 200 yards in its entire life. They don't travel very far.
p90
aVWhat they're very good at doing is hitchhiking,
p91
aVparticularly the eggs.
p92
aVThey will lay their eggs in clear water, any pool, any puddle,
p93
aVany birdbath, any flower pot,
p94
aVanywhere there's clear water, they'll lay their eggs,
p95
aVand if that clear water is near freight, it's near a port,
p96
aVif it's anywhere near transport,
p97
aVthose eggs will then get transported around the world.
p98
aVAnd that's what's happened. Mankind has transported
p99
aVthese eggs all the way around the world,
p100
aVand these insects have infested over 100 countries,
p101
aVand there's now 2.5 billion people living in countries
p102
aVwhere this mosquito resides.
p103
aa(lp104
VTo give you just a couple of examples
p105
aVhow fast this has happened,
p106
aVin the mid-'70s, Brazil declared, "We have no Aedes aegypti,"
p107
aVand currently they spend about a billion dollars now
p108
aVa year trying to get rid of it, trying to control it,
p109
aVjust one species of mosquito.
p110
aVTwo days ago, or yesterday, I can't remember which,
p111
aVI saw a Reuters report that said
p112
aVMadeira had had their first cases of dengue,
p113
aVabout 52 cases, with about 400 probable cases.
p114
aVThat's two days ago.
p115
aVInterestingly, Madeira first got the insect in 2005,
p116
aVand here we are, a few years later,
p117
aVfirst cases of dengue.
p118
aVSo the one thing you'll find is that where the mosquito goes,
p119
aVdengue will follow.
p120
aVOnce you've got the mosquito in your area,
p121
aVanyone coming into that area with dengue,
p122
aVmosquito will bite them, mosquito will bite somewhere else,
p123
aVsomewhere else, somewhere else,
p124
aVand you'll get an epidemic.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo we must be good at killing mosquitos.
p127
aVI mean, that can't be very difficult.
p128
aVWell, there's two principle ways.
p129
aVThe first way is that you use larvicides.
p130
aVYou use chemicals. You put them into water where they breed.
p131
aVNow in an urban environment, that's extraordinarily difficult.
p132
aVYou've got to get your chemical into every puddle,
p133
aVevery birdbath, every tree trunk.
p134
aVIt's just not practical.
p135
aVThe second way you can do it
p136
aVis actually trying to kill the insects as they fly around.
p137
aVThis is a picture of fogging.
p138
aVHere what someone is doing
p139
aVis mixing up chemical in a smoke
p140
aVand basically spreading that through the environment.
p141
aVYou could do the same with a space spray.
p142
aVThis is really unpleasant stuff,
p143
aVand if it was any good, we wouldn't have this massive increase
p144
aVin mosquitos and we wouldn't have this massive increase in dengue fever.
p145
aVSo it's not very effective, but it's probably
p146
aVthe best thing we've got at the moment.
p147
aVHaving said that, actually, your best form of protection
p148
aVand my best form of protection is a long-sleeve shirt
p149
aVand a little bit of DEET to go with it.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo let's start again. Let's design a product,
p152
aVright from the word go, and decide what we want.
p153
aVWell we clearly need something that is effective
p154
aVat reducing the mosquito population.
p155
aVThere's no point in just killing the odd mosquito here and there.
p156
aVWe want something that gets that population right the way down
p157
aVso it can't get the disease transmission.
p158
aVClearly the product you've got has got to be safe to humans.
p159
aVWe are going to use it in and around humans.
p160
aVIt has to be safe.
p161
aVWe don't want to have a lasting impact on the environment.
p162
aVWe don't want to do anything that you can't undo.
p163
aVMaybe a better product comes along in 20, 30 years.
p164
aVFine. We don't want a lasting environmental impact.
p165
aVWe want something that's relatively cheap, or cost-effective,
p166
aVbecause there's an awful lot of countries involved,
p167
aVand some of them are emerging markets,
p168
aVsome of them emerging countries, low-income.
p169
aVAnd finally, you want something that's species-specific.
p170
aVYou want to get rid of this mosquito that spreads dengue,
p171
aVbut you don't really want to get all the other insects.
p172
aVSome are quite beneficial. Some are important to your ecosystem.
p173
aVThis one's not. It's invaded you.
p174
aVBut you don't want to get all of the insects.
p175
aVYou just want to get this one.
p176
aVAnd most of the time, you'll find this insect
p177
aVlives in and around your home,
p178
aVso this \u2014 whatever we do has got to get to that insect.
p179
aVIt's got to get into people's houses, into the bedrooms,
p180
aVinto the kitchens.
p181
aa(lp182
VNow there are two features of mosquito biology
p183
aVthat really help us in this project,
p184
aVand that is, firstly, males don't bite.
p185
aVIt's only the female mosquito that will actually bite you.
p186
aVThe male can't bite you, won't bite you,
p187
aVdoesn't have the mouth parts to bite you.
p188
aVIt's just the female.
p189
aVAnd the second is a phenomenon
p190
aVthat males are very, very good at finding females.
p191
aVIf there's a male mosquito that you release,
p192
aVand if there's a female around, that male will find the female.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo basically, we've used those two factors.
p195
aVSo here's a typical situation,
p196
aVmale meets female, lots of offspring.
p197
aVA single female will lay about
p198
aVup to 100 eggs at a time,
p199
aVup to about 500 in her lifetime.
p200
aVNow if that male is carrying a gene
p201
aVwhich causes the death of the offspring,
p202
aVthen the offspring don't survive,
p203
aVand instead of having 500 mosquitos running around,
p204
aVyou have none.
p205
aVAnd if you can put more, I'll call them sterile,
p206
aVthat the offspring will actually die at different stages,
p207
aVbut I'll call them sterile for now.
p208
aVIf you put more sterile males out into the environment,
p209
aVthen the females are more likely to find a sterile male
p210
aVthan a fertile one, and you will bring that population down.
p211
aVSo the males will go out, they'll look for females,
p212
aVthey'll mate. If they mate successfully, then no offspring.
p213
aVIf they don't find a female, then they'll die anyway.
p214
aVThey only live a few days.
p215
aa(lp216
VAnd that's exactly where we are.
p217
aVSo this is technology that was developed
p218
aVin Oxford University a few years ago.
p219
aVThe company itself, Oxitec, we've been working
p220
aVfor the last 10 years, very much on a sort of similar
p221
aVdevelopment pathway that you'd get with a pharmaceutical company.
p222
aVSo about 10 years of internal evaluation, testing,
p223
aVto get this to a state where we think it's actually ready.
p224
aVAnd then we've gone out into the big outdoors,
p225
aValways with local community consent,
p226
aValways with the necessary permits.
p227
aVSo we've done field trials now in the Cayman Islands,
p228
aVa small one in Malaysia,
p229
aVand two more now in Brazil.
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd what's the result?
p232
aVWell, the result has been very good.
p233
aVIn about four months of release,
p234
aVwe've brought that population of mosquitos
p235
aV\u2014 in most cases we're dealing with villages here
p236
aVof about 2,000, 3,000 people, that sort of size,
p237
aVstarting small \u2014
p238
aVwe've taken that mosquito population down
p239
aVby about 85 percent in about four months.
p240
aVAnd in fact, the numbers after that get,
p241
aVthose get very difficult to count, because there just aren't any left.
p242
aVSo that's been what we've seen in Cayman,
p243
aVit's been what we've seen in Brazil
p244
aVin those trials.
p245
aa(lp246
VAnd now what we're doing is we're going through a process
p247
aVto scale up to a town of about 50,000,
p248
aVso we can see this work at big scale.
p249
aVAnd we've got a production unit in Oxford,
p250
aVor just south of Oxford, where we actually produce these mosquitos.
p251
aVWe can produce them,
p252
aVin a space a bit more than this red carpet,
p253
aVI can produce about 20 million a week.
p254
aVWe can transport them around the world.
p255
aVIt's not very expensive, because it's a coffee cup \u2014
p256
aVsomething the size of a coffee cup
p257
aVwill hold about three million eggs.
p258
aVSo freight costs aren't our biggest problem. (Laughter)
p259
aVSo we've got that. You could call it a mosquito factory.
p260
aVAnd for Brazil, where we've been doing some trials,
p261
aVthe Brazilian government themselves have now built
p262
aVtheir own mosquito factory, far bigger than ours,
p263
aVand we'll use that for scaling up in Brazil.
p264
aa(lp265
VThere you are. We've sent mosquito eggs.
p266
aVWe've separated the males from the females.
p267
aVThe males have been put in little pots
p268
aVand the truck is going down the road
p269
aVand they are releasing males as they go.
p270
aVIt's actually a little bit more precise than that.
p271
aVYou want to release them so that
p272
aVyou get good coverage of your area.
p273
aVSo you take a Google Map, you divide it up,
p274
aVwork out how far they can fly,
p275
aVand make sure you're releasing such that you get
p276
aVcoverage of the area, and then you go back,
p277
aVand within a very short space of time,
p278
aVyou're bringing that population right the way down.
p279
aa(lp280
VWe've also done this in agriculture.
p281
aVWe've got several different species of agriculture coming along,
p282
aVand I'm hoping that soon
p283
aVwe'll be able to get some funding together so we can get back
p284
aVand start looking at malaria.
p285
aa(lp286
VSo that's where we stand at the moment,
p287
aVand I've just got a few final thoughts,
p288
aVwhich is that this is another way in which biology
p289
aVis now coming in to supplement chemistry
p290
aVin some of our societal advances in this area,
p291
aVand these biological approaches are coming in
p292
aVin very different forms,
p293
aVand when you think about genetic engineering,
p294
aVwe've now got enzymes for industrial processing,
p295
aVenzymes, genetically engineered enzymes in food.
p296
aVWe have G.M. crops, we have pharmaceuticals,
p297
aVwe have new vaccines,
p298
aVall using roughly the same technology, but with very different outcomes.
p299
aVAnd I'm in favor, actually. Of course I am.
p300
aVI'm in favor of particularly where the older technologies
p301
aVdon't work well or have become unacceptable.
p302
aVAnd although the techniques are similar,
p303
aVthe outcomes are very, very different,
p304
aVand if you take our approach, for example,
p305
aVand you compare it to, say, G.M. crops,
p306
aVboth techniques are trying to produce a massive benefit.
p307
aVBoth have a side benefit,
p308
aVwhich is that we reduce pesticide use tremendously.
p309
aVBut whereas a G.M. crop is trying to protect the plant,
p310
aVfor example, and give it an advantage,
p311
aVwhat we're actually doing is taking the mosquito
p312
aVand giving it the biggest disadvantage it can possibly have,
p313
aVrendering it unable to reproduce effectively.
p314
aVSo for the mosquito, it's a dead end.
p315
aa(lp316
VThank you very much. (Applause)

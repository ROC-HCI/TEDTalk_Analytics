VI think the beautiful Malin [Akerman] put it perfectly.
p5
aVEvery man deserves the opportunity
p6
aVto grow a little bit of luxury.
p7
aa(lp8
VLadies and gentlemen, and more importantly,
p9
aVMo Bros and Mo Sistas \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p10
aVfor the next 17 minutes, I'm going to share with you
p11
aVmy Movember journey, and how, through that journey,
p12
aVwe've redefined charity, we're redefining the way
p13
aVprostate cancer researchers are working together
p14
aVthroughout the world, and I hope, through that process,
p15
aVthat I inspire you to create something significant
p16
aVin your life, something significant that will go on
p17
aVand make this world a better place.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo the most common question I get asked,
p20
aVand I'm going to answer it now so I don't have to do it
p21
aVover drinks tonight, is how did this come about?
p22
aVHow did Movember start?
p23
aVWell, normally, a charity starts with the cause, and someone
p24
aVthat is directly affected by a cause.
p25
aVThey then go on to create an event, and beyond that,
p26
aVa foundation to support that.
p27
aVPretty much in every case, that's how a charity starts.
p28
aVNot so with Movember. Movember started in a very
p29
aVtraditional Australian way. It was on a Sunday afternoon.
p30
aVI was with my brother and a mate having a few beers,
p31
aVand I was watching the world go by,
p32
aVhad a few more beers, and the conversation turned
p33
aVto '70s fashion \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p34
aVand how everything manages to come back into style.
p35
aVAnd a few more beers, I said, "There has to be some stuff
p36
aVthat hasn't come back." (Laughter)
p37
aVThen one more beer and it was, whatever happened to the mustache?
p38
aVWhy hasn't that made a comeback? (Laughter)
p39
aVSo then there was a lot more beers, and then the day ended
p40
aVwith a challenge to bring the mustache back. (Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VSo in Australia, "mo" is slang for mustache,
p43
aVso we renamed the month of November "Movember"
p44
aVand created some pretty basic rules, which still stand today.
p45
aVAnd they are: start the month clean-shaven,
p46
aVrock a mustache \u2014 not a beard, not a goatee, a mustache \u2014
p47
aVfor the 30 days of November, and then we agreed
p48
aVthat we would come together at the end of the month,
p49
aVhave a mustache-themed party, and award a prize
p50
aVfor the best, and of course, the worst mustache. (Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VNow trust me, when you're growing a mustache
p53
aVback in 2003, and there were 30 of us back then,
p54
aVand this was before the ironic hipster mustache movement
p55
aV\u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p56
aVit created a lot of controversy. (Laughter)
p57
aVSo my boss wouldn't let me go and see clients.
p58
aVMy girlfriend at the time, who's no longer my girlfriend \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 hated it.
p59
aVParents would shuffle kids away from us. (Laughter)
p60
aVBut we came together at the end of the month and
p61
aVwe celebrated our journey, and it was a real journey.
p62
aVAnd we had a lot of fun, and in 2004, I said to the guys,
p63
aV"That was so much fun. We need to legitimize this
p64
aVso we can get away with it year on year." (Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VSo we started thinking about that, and we were inspired
p67
aVby the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer.
p68
aVAnd we thought, you know what, there's nothing for men's health.
p69
aVWhy is that? Why can't we combine growing a mustache
p70
aVand doing something for men's health?
p71
aVAnd I started to research that topic, and discovered
p72
aVprostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer
p73
aVin terms of the number of men that die from it and are diagnosed with it.
p74
aa(lp75
VBut there was nothing for this cause,
p76
aVso we married growing a mustache with prostate cancer,
p77
aVand then we created our tagline, which is,
p78
aV"Changing the face of men's health."
p79
aVAnd that eloquently describes the challenge,
p80
aVchanging your appearance for the 30 days,
p81
aVand also the outcome that we're trying to achieve:
p82
aVgetting men engaged in their health, having them have
p83
aVa better understanding about the health risks that they face.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo with that model, I then
p86
aVcold-called the CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation.
p87
aVI said to him, "I've got the most amazing idea
p88
aVthat's going to transform your organization." (Laughter)
p89
aVAnd I didn't want to share with him the idea over the phone,
p90
aVso I convinced him to meet with me for coffee in Melbourne
p91
aVin 2004.
p92
aVAnd we sat down, and I shared with him my vision
p93
aVof getting men growing mustaches across Australia,
p94
aVraising awareness for this cause,
p95
aVand funds for his organization. And I needed a partnership
p96
aVto legitimately do that.
p97
aVAnd I said, "We're going to come together at the end,
p98
aVwe're going to have a mustache-themed party, we're going to have DJs,
p99
aVwe're going to celebrate life, and we're going to change the face of men's health."
p100
aVAnd he just looked at me and laughed, and he said,
p101
aVhe said, "Adam, that's a really novel idea,
p102
aVbut we're an ultraconservative organization.
p103
aVWe can't have anything to do with you." (Laughter)
p104
aVSo I paid for coffee that day \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p105
aVand his parting comment as we shook hands was,
p106
aV"Listen, if you happen to raise any money out of this,
p107
aVwe'll gladly take it." (Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VSo my lesson that year was persistence.
p110
aVAnd we persisted, and we got 450 guys
p111
aVgrowing mustaches, and together we raised 54,000 dollars,
p112
aVand we donated every cent of that to the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia,
p113
aVand that represented at the time the single biggest donation
p114
aVthey'd ever received.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo from that day forward, my life has become about a mustache.
p117
aVEvery day \u2014 this morning, I wake up and go, my life
p118
aVis about a mustache. (Laughter)
p119
aVEssentially, I'm a mustache farmer. (Laughter)
p120
aVAnd my season is November. (Applause)
p121
aV(Applause)
p122
aa(lp123
VSo in 2005, the campaign got more momentum,
p124
aVwas more successful in Australia and then New Zealand,
p125
aVand then in 2006 we came to a pivotal point.
p126
aVIt was consuming so much of our time after hours
p127
aVon weekends that we thought, we either need
p128
aVto close this down or figure a way to fund Movember
p129
aVso that I could quit my job and go and spend more time
p130
aVin the organization and take it to the next level.
p131
aa(lp132
VIt's really interesting when you try and figure a way
p133
aVto fund a fundraising organization
p134
aVbuilt off growing mustaches. (Laughter)
p135
aVLet me tell you that there's not too many people interested
p136
aVin investing in that, not even the Prostate Cancer Foundation,
p137
aVwho we'd raised about 1.2 million dollars for at that stage.
p138
aVSo again we persisted, and Foster's Brewing came to the party
p139
aVand gave us our first ever sponsorship,
p140
aVand that was enough for me to quit my job, I did consulting on the side.
p141
aVAnd leading into Movember 2006,
p142
aVwe'd run through all the money from Foster's,
p143
aVwe'd run through all the money I had, and essentially
p144
aVwe had no money left, and we'd convinced all our suppliers \u2014
p145
aVcreative agencies, web development agencies,
p146
aVhosting companies, whatnot \u2014 to delay their billing until December.
p147
aVSo we'd racked up at this stage about 600,000 dollars
p148
aVworth of debt. So if Movember 2006 didn't happen,
p149
aVthe four founders, well, we would've been broke,
p150
aVwe would've been homeless, sitting on the street
p151
aVwith mustaches. (Laughter)
p152
aVBut we thought, you know what, if that's the worst thing
p153
aVthat happens, so what?
p154
aVWe're going to have a lot of fun doing it, and it taught us
p155
aVthe importance of taking risks and really smart risks.
p156
aa(lp157
VThen in early 2007, a really interesting thing happened.
p158
aVWe had Mo Bros from Canada, from the U.S.,
p159
aVand from the U.K. emailing us and calling us and saying,
p160
aVhey, there's nothing for prostate cancer.
p161
aVBring this campaign to these countries.
p162
aVSo we thought, why not? Let's do it.
p163
aVSo I cold-called the CEO of Prostate Cancer Canada,
p164
aVand I said to him, "I have this most amazing concept."
p165
aV(Laughter)
p166
aV"It's going to transform your organization. I don't want
p167
aVto tell you about it now, but will you meet with me
p168
aVif I fly all the way to Toronto?" So I flew here,
p169
aVmet down on Front Street East, and we sat in the boardroom,
p170
aVand I said, "Right, here's my vision of getting men growing mustaches
p171
aVall across Canada raising awareness and funds for your organization."
p172
aVAnd he looked at me and laughed and said,
p173
aV"Adam, sounds like a really novel idea, but we're
p174
aVan ultraconservative organization." (Laughter)
p175
aVI've heard this before. I know how it goes.
p176
aVBut he said, "We will partner with you,
p177
aVbut we're not going to invest in it. You need to figure
p178
aVa way to bring this campaign across here and make it work."
p179
aa(lp180
VSo what we did was, we took some of the money that
p181
aVwe raised in Australia to bring the campaign across
p182
aVto this country, the U.S, and the U.K., and we did that
p183
aVbecause we knew, if this was successful,
p184
aVwe could raise infinitely more money globally
p185
aVthan we could just in Australia. And that money
p186
aVfuels research, and that research will get us to a cure.
p187
aVAnd we're not about finding an Australian cure
p188
aVor a Canadian cure, we're about finding the cure.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo in 2007, we brought the campaign across here,
p191
aVand it was, it set the stage for the campaign.
p192
aVIt wasn't as successful as we thought it would be.
p193
aVWe were sort of very gung ho with our success in Australia
p194
aVand New Zealand at that stage.
p195
aVSo that year really taught us the importance of being patient
p196
aVand really understanding the local market before you
p197
aVbecome so bold as to set lofty targets.
p198
aa(lp199
VBut what I'm really pleased to say is, in 2010,
p200
aVMovember became a truly global movement.
p201
aVCanada was just pipped to the post in terms of
p202
aVthe number one fundraising campaign in the world.
p203
aVLast year we had 450,000 Mo Bros spread across the world
p204
aVand together we raised 77 million dollars.
p205
aV(Applause)
p206
aVAnd that makes Movember now the biggest funder
p207
aVof prostate cancer research and support programs in the world.
p208
aVAnd that is an amazing achievement when you think about
p209
aVus growing mustaches. (Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
VAnd for us, we have redefined charity.
p212
aVOur ribbon is a hairy ribbon. (Laughter)
p213
aVOur ambassadors are the Mo Bros and the Mo Sistas,
p214
aVand I think that's been fundamental to our success.
p215
aVWe hand across our brand and our campaign to those people.
p216
aVWe let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo now I live in Los Angeles, because
p219
aVthe Prostate Cancer Foundation of the U.S. is based there,
p220
aVand I always get asked by the media down there,
p221
aVbecause it's so celebrity-driven,
p222
aV"Who are your celebrity ambassadors?"
p223
aVAnd I say to them, "Last year we were fortunate enough
p224
aVto have 450,000 celebrity ambassadors."
p225
aVAnd they go, "What, what do you mean?"
p226
aVAnd it's like, everything single person, every single Mo Bro
p227
aVand Mo Sista that participates in Movember
p228
aVis our celebrity ambassador, and that is so, so important
p229
aVand fundamental to our success.
p230
aa(lp231
VNow what I want to share with you is
p232
aVone of my most touching Movember moments,
p233
aVand it happened here in Toronto last year,
p234
aVat the end of the campaign.
p235
aVI was out with a team. It was the end of Movember.
p236
aVWe'd had a great campaign, and to be honest, we'd had
p237
aVour fair share of beer that night, but I said,
p238
aV"You know what, I think we've got one more bar left in us." (Laughter)
p239
aVSo we piled into a taxi, and this is our taxi driver,
p240
aVand I was sitting in the back seat, and he turned around
p241
aVand said, "Where are you going?"
p242
aVAnd I said, "Hang on, that is an amazing mustache."
p243
aV(Laughter)
p244
aVAnd he said, "I'm doing it for Movember." And I said,
p245
aV"So am I." And I said, "Tell me your Movember story."
p246
aVAnd he goes, "Listen, I know it's about men's health,
p247
aVI know it's about prostate cancer, but this is for breast cancer."
p248
aVAnd I said, "Okay, that's interesting."
p249
aVAnd he goes, "Last year, my mom passed away from breast cancer in Sri Lanka,
p250
aVbecause we couldn't afford proper treatment for her,"
p251
aVand he said, "This mustache is my tribute to my mom."
p252
aVAnd we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi,
p253
aVand I didn't tell him who I was, because I didn't think it was appropriate,
p254
aVand I just shook his hand and I said, "Thank you so much.
p255
aVYour mom would be so proud."
p256
aVAnd from that moment I realized that Movember
p257
aVis so much more than a mustache, having a joke.
p258
aVIt's about each person coming to this platform,
p259
aVembracing it in their own way,
p260
aVand being significant in their own life.
p261
aa(lp262
VFor us now at Movember, we really focus on
p263
aVthree program areas, and having a true impact:
p264
aVawareness and education,
p265
aVsurvivor support programs, and research.
p266
aVNow we always focus, naturally, on how much we raise,
p267
aVbecause it's a very tangible outcome, but for me,
p268
aVawareness and education is more important than the funds we raise,
p269
aVbecause I know that is changing and saving lives today,
p270
aVand it's probably best exampled by
p271
aVa young guy that I met at South by Southwest
p272
aVin Austin, Texas, at the start of the year.
p273
aVHe came up to me and said, "Thank you for starting Movember."
p274
aVAnd I said, "Thank you for doing Movember."
p275
aVAnd I looked at him, and I was like, "I'm pretty sure you can't grow a mustache." (Laughter)
p276
aVAnd I said, "What's your Movember story?"
p277
aVAnd he said, "I grew the worst mustache ever." (Laughter)
p278
aV"But I went home for Thanksgiving dinner, and pretty quickly
p279
aVthe conversation around the table turned to
p280
aVwhat the hell was going on." (Laughter)
p281
aV"And we talked \u2014 I talked to them about Movember,
p282
aVand then after that, my dad came up to me, and at the age
p283
aVof 26, for the first time ever, I had a conversation with my dad
p284
aVone on one about men's health. I had a conversation
p285
aVwith my dad about prostate cancer, and I learned
p286
aVthat my grandfather had prostate cancer
p287
aVand I was able to share with my dad that he was
p288
aVtwice as likely to get that disease, and he didn't know that,
p289
aVand he hadn't been getting screened for it."
p290
aVSo now, that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer.
p291
aa(lp292
VSo those conversations, getting men engaged in this,
p293
aVat whatever age, is so critically important,
p294
aVand in my view so much more important
p295
aVthan the funds we raise.
p296
aa(lp297
VNow to the funds we raise, and research,
p298
aVand how we're redefining research.
p299
aVWe fund prostate cancer foundations now in 13 countries.
p300
aVWe literally fund hundreds if not thousands of institutions
p301
aVand researchers around the world, and when we looked
p302
aVat this more recently, we realized there's a real lack
p303
aVof collaboration going on even within institutions,
p304
aVlet alone nationally, let alone globally, and this is not unique
p305
aVto prostate cancer. This is cancer research the world over.
p306
aVAnd so we said, right, we'd redefined charity. We need
p307
aVto redefine the way these guys operate. How do we do that?
p308
aVSo what we did was, we created a global action plan,
p309
aVand we're taking 10 percent of what's raised in each country
p310
aVnow and putting it into a global fund, and we've got
p311
aVthe best prostate cancer scientific minds in the world
p312
aVthat look after that fund,
p313
aVand they come together each year and identify
p314
aVthe number one priority,
p315
aVand that, last year, was getting a better screening test.
p316
aVSo they identified that as a priority, and then
p317
aVthey've got and recruited now 300 researchers
p318
aVfrom around the world that are studying that topic,
p319
aVessentially the same topic.
p320
aVSo now we're funding them to the tune of about
p321
aVfive or six million dollars to collaborate
p322
aVand bringing them together, and that's a unique thing
p323
aVin the cancer world, and we know, through that collaboration,
p324
aVit will accelerate outcomes.
p325
aVAnd that's how we're redefining the research world.
p326
aa(lp327
VSo, what I know about my Movember journey is that,
p328
aVwith a really creative idea,
p329
aVwith passion, with persistence, and a lot of patience,
p330
aVfour mates, four mustaches,
p331
aVcan inspire a room full of people,
p332
aVand that room full of people can go on and inspire a city,
p333
aVand that city is Melbourne, my home.
p334
aVAnd that city can go on and inspire a state, and that state
p335
aVcan go on and inspire a nation, and beyond that,
p336
aVyou can create a global movement
p337
aVthat is changing the face of men's health.
p338
aa(lp339
VMy name is Adam Garone, and that's my story.
p340
aVThank you. (Applause)

The two wondered if they could bring the moustache back in vogue and, in the process, raise awareness for men&#39;s health along with money for prostate cancer research. Thus began the&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://movember.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Movember</a> movement.

VI was walking in the market one day with my wife,
p5
aVand somebody stuck a cage in my face.
p6
aVAnd in between those slits
p7
aVwere the saddest eyes I've ever seen.
p8
aVThere was a very sick orangutan baby, my first encounter.
p9
aVThat evening I came back to the market in the dark
p10
aVand I heard "uhh, uhh,"
p11
aVand sure enough I found a dying orangutan baby on a garbage heap.
p12
aVOf course, the cage was salvaged.
p13
aVI took up the little baby,
p14
aVmassaged her, forced her to drink
p15
aVuntil she finally started breathing normally.
p16
aa(lp17
VThis is Uce.
p18
aVShe's now living in the jungle of Sungai Wain,
p19
aVand this is Matahari, her second son,
p20
aVwhich, by the way, is also the son of the second orangutan I rescued, Dodoy.
p21
aVThat changed my life quite dramatically,
p22
aVand as of today, I have almost 1,000 babies in my two centers.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Applause)
p25
aa(lp26
VNo. No. No. Wrong.
p27
aVIt's horrible. It's a proof of our failing to save them in the wild.
p28
aVIt's not good.
p29
aVThis is merely proof of everyone failing to do the right thing.
p30
aVHaving more than all the orangutans in all the zoos in the world together,
p31
aVjust now like victims for every baby,
p32
aVsix have disappeared from the forest.
p33
aa(lp34
VThe deforestation, especially for oil palm,
p35
aVto provide biofuel for Western countries
p36
aVis what's causing these problems.
p37
aVAnd those are the peat swamp forests on 20 meters of peat,
p38
aVthe largest accumulation of organic material in the world.
p39
aVWhen you open this for growing oil palms
p40
aVyou're creating CO2 volcanoes
p41
aVthat are emitting so much CO2
p42
aVthat my country is now the third largest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the world,
p43
aVafter China and the United States.
p44
aVAnd we don't have any industry at all \u2014
p45
aVit's only because of this deforestation.
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd these are horrible images.
p48
aVI'm not going to talk too long about it,
p49
aVbut there are so many of the family of Uce,
p50
aVwhich are not so fortunate to live out there in the forest,
p51
aVthat still have to go through that process.
p52
aVAnd I don't know anymore where to put them.
p53
aVSo I decided that I had to come up with a solution for her
p54
aVbut also a solution
p55
aVthat will benefit the people that are trying to exploit those forests,
p56
aVto get their hands on the last timber
p57
aVand that are causing, in that way,
p58
aVthe loss of habitat and all those victims.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo I created the place Samboja Lestari,
p61
aVand the idea was,
p62
aVif I can do this on the worst possible place that I can think of
p63
aVwhere there is really nothing left,
p64
aVno one will have an excuse to say, "Yeah, but ..."
p65
aVNo. Everyone should be able to follow this.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo we're in East Borneo. This is the place where I started.
p68
aVAs you can see there's only yellow terrain.
p69
aVThere's nothing left \u2014 just a bit of grass there.
p70
aVIn 2002 we had about 50 percent of the people jobless there.
p71
aVThere was a huge amount of crime.
p72
aVPeople spent so much of their money on health issues and drinking water.
p73
aVThere was no agricultural productivity left.
p74
aVThis was the poorest district in the whole province
p75
aVand it was a total extinction of wildlife.
p76
aVThis was like a biological desert.
p77
aVWhen I stood there in the grass, it's hot \u2014 not even the sound of insects \u2014
p78
aVjust this waving grass.
p79
aa(lp80
VStill, four years later we have created jobs for about 3,000 people.
p81
aVThe climate has changed. I will show you:
p82
aVno more flooding, no more fires.
p83
aVIt's no longer the poorest district,
p84
aVand there is a huge development of biodiversity.
p85
aVWe've got over 1,000 species. We have 137 bird species as of today.
p86
aVWe have 30 species of reptiles.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo what happened here? We created a huge economic failure in this forest.
p89
aVSo basically the whole process of destruction
p90
aVhad gone a bit slower than what is happening now with the oil palm.
p91
aVBut we saw the same thing.
p92
aVWe had slash and burn agriculture;
p93
aVpeople cannot afford the fertilizer,
p94
aVso they burn the trees and have the minerals available there;
p95
aVthe fires become more frequent,
p96
aVand after a while you're stuck with an area of land
p97
aVwhere there is no fertility left.
p98
aVThere are no trees left.
p99
aVStill, in this place, in this grassland
p100
aVwhere you can see our very first office there on that hill,
p101
aVfour years later, there is this one green blop on the Earth's surface ...
p102
aa(lp103
V(Applause)
p104
aa(lp105
VAnd there are all these animals, and all these people happy,
p106
aVand there's this economic value.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo how's this possible?
p109
aVIt was quite simple. If you'll look at the steps:
p110
aVwe bought the land, we dealt with the fire,
p111
aVand then only, we started doing the reforestation
p112
aVby combining agriculture with forestry.
p113
aVOnly then we set up the infrastructure and management and the monetary.
p114
aVBut we made sure that in every step of the way
p115
aVthe local people were going to be fully involved
p116
aVso that no outside forces would be able to interfere with that.
p117
aVThe people would become the defenders of that forest.
p118
aVSo we do the "people, profit, planet" principles,
p119
aVbut we do it in addition
p120
aVto a sure legal status \u2014
p121
aVbecause if the forest belongs to the state,
p122
aVpeople say, "It belongs to me, it belongs to everyone."
p123
aVAnd then we apply all these other principles
p124
aVlike transparency, professional management, measurable results,
p125
aVscalability, [unclear], etc.
p126
aa(lp127
VWhat we did was we formulated recipes \u2014
p128
aVhow to go from a starting situation where you have nothing
p129
aVto a target situation.
p130
aVYou formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control,
p131
aVwhether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the plant choice.
p132
aVAnd then you look at the outputs and you start measuring what comes out.
p133
aVNow in this recipe you also have the cost.
p134
aVYou also know how much labor is needed.
p135
aVIf you can drop this recipe on the map
p136
aVon a sandy soil, on a clay soil,
p137
aVon a steep slope, on flat soil,
p138
aVyou put those different recipes; if you combine them,
p139
aVout of that comes a business plan,
p140
aVcomes a work plan, and you can optimize it
p141
aVfor the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have,
p142
aVand you can do it.
p143
aa(lp144
VThis is how it looks like in practice. We have this grass we want to get rid of.
p145
aVIt exudes [unclear]-like compounds from the roots.
p146
aVThe acacia trees are of a very low value
p147
aVbut we need them to restore the micro-climate, to protect the soil
p148
aVand to shake out the grasses.
p149
aVAnd after eight years they might actually yield some timber \u2014
p150
aVthat is, if you can preserve it in the right way,
p151
aVwhich we can do with bamboo peels.
p152
aVIt's an old temple-building technique from Japan
p153
aVbut bamboo is very fire-susceptible.
p154
aVSo if we would plant that in the beginning
p155
aVwe would have a very high risk of losing everything again.
p156
aVSo we plant it later, along the waterways
p157
aVto filter the water, provide the raw products
p158
aVjust in time for when the timber becomes available.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo the idea is: how to integrate these flows
p161
aVin space, over time and with the limited means you have.
p162
aVSo we plant the trees, we plant these pineapples
p163
aVand beans and ginger in between, to reduce the competition for the trees,
p164
aVthe crop fertilizer. Organic material is useful for the agricultural crops,
p165
aVfor the people, but also helps the trees. The farmers have free land,
p166
aVthe system yields early income, the orangutans get healthy food
p167
aVand we can speed up ecosystem regeneration
p168
aVwhile even saving some money.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo beautiful. What a theory.
p171
aa(lp172
VBut is it really that easy?
p173
aVNot really, because if you looked at what happened in 1998,
p174
aVthe fire started.
p175
aVThis is an area of about 50 million hectares.
p176
aVJanuary.
p177
aVFebruary.
p178
aVMarch.
p179
aVApril.
p180
aVMay.
p181
aVWe lost 5.5 million hectares in just a matter of a few months.
p182
aVThis is because we have 10,000 of those underground fires
p183
aVthat you also have in Pennsylvania here in the United States.
p184
aVAnd once the soil gets dried, you're in a dry season \u2014 you get cracks,
p185
aVoxygen goes in, flames come out and the problem starts all over again.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo how to break that cycle?
p188
aVFire is the biggest problem.
p189
aVThis is what it looked like for three months.
p190
aVFor three months, the automatic lights outside did not go off
p191
aVbecause it was that dark.
p192
aVWe lost all the crops. No children gained weight for over a year;
p193
aVthey lost 12 IQ points. It was a disaster
p194
aVfor orangutans and people.
p195
aVSo these fires are really the first things to work on.
p196
aVThat was why I put it as a single point up there.
p197
aVAnd you need the local people for that because these grasslands,
p198
aVonce they start burning ... It goes through it like a windstorm
p199
aVand you lose again the last bit of ash and nutrients
p200
aVto the first rainfall \u2014 going to the sea
p201
aVkilling off the coral reefs there.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo you have to do it with the local people.
p204
aVThat is the short-term solution but you also need a long-term solution.
p205
aVSo what we did is, we created
p206
aVa ring of sugar palms around the area.
p207
aVThese sugar palms turn out to be fire-resistant \u2014
p208
aValso flood-resistant, by the way \u2014
p209
aVand they provide a lot of income for local people.
p210
aa(lp211
VThis is what it looks like:
p212
aVthe people have to tap them twice a day \u2014 just a millimeter slice \u2014
p213
aVand the only thing you harvest is sugar water,
p214
aVcarbon dioxide, rain fall and a little bit of sunshine.
p215
aVIn principle, you make those trees into
p216
aVbiological photovoltaic cells.
p217
aVAnd you can create so much energy from this \u2014
p218
aVthey produce three times more energy per hectare per year,
p219
aVbecause you can tap them on a daily basis.
p220
aVYou don't need to harvest [unclear]
p221
aVor any other of the crops.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo this is the combination where we have all this genetic potential in the tropics,
p224
aVwhich is still unexploited, and doing it in combination with technology.
p225
aVBut also your legal side needs to be in very good order.
p226
aVSo we bought that land,
p227
aVand here is where we started our project \u2014
p228
aVin the middle of nowhere.
p229
aVAnd if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area
p230
aVis divided into strips that go over different types of soil,
p231
aVand we were actually monitoring,
p232
aVmeasuring every single tree in these 2,000 hectares, 5,000 acres.
p233
aVAnd this forest is quite different.
p234
aa(lp235
VWhat I really did was I just followed nature,
p236
aVand nature doesn't know monocultures,
p237
aVbut a natural forest is multilayered.
p238
aVThat means that both in the ground and above the ground
p239
aVit can make better use of the available light,
p240
aVit can store more carbon in the system, it can provide more functions.
p241
aVBut, it's more complicated. It's not that simple, and you have to work with the people.
p242
aa(lp243
VSo, just like nature,
p244
aVwe also grow fast planting trees and underneath that,
p245
aVwe grow the slower growing, primary-grain forest trees of a very high diversity
p246
aVthat can optimally use that light. Then,
p247
aVwhat is just as important: get the right fungi in there
p248
aVthat will grow into those leaves, bring back the nutrients
p249
aVto the roots of the trees that have just dropped that leaf within 24 hours.
p250
aVAnd they become like nutrient pumps.
p251
aVYou need the bacteria to fix nitrogen,
p252
aVand without those microorganisms, you won't have any performance at all.
p253
aa(lp254
VAnd then we started planting \u2014 only 1,000 trees a day.
p255
aVWe could have planted many, many more, but we didn't want to
p256
aVbecause we wanted to keep the number of jobs stable.
p257
aVWe didn't want to lose the people
p258
aVthat are going to work in that plantation.
p259
aVAnd we do a lot of work here.
p260
aVWe use indicator plants to look at what soil types,
p261
aVor what vegetables will grow, or what trees will grow here.
p262
aVAnd we have monitored every single one of those trees from space.
p263
aa(lp264
VThis is what it looks like in reality;
p265
aVyou have this irregular ring around it,
p266
aVwith strips of 100 meters wide, with sugar palms
p267
aVthat can provide income for 648 families.
p268
aVIt's only a small part of the area.
p269
aa(lp270
VThe nursery, in here, is quite different.
p271
aVIf you look at the number of tree species we have in Europe, for instance,
p272
aVfrom the Urals up to England, you know how many?
p273
aV165.
p274
aVIn this nursery, we're going to grow 10 times more than the number of species.
p275
aVCan you imagine?
p276
aVYou do need to know what you are working with,
p277
aVbut it's that diversity which makes it work.
p278
aVThat you can go from this zero situation,
p279
aVby planting the vegetables and the trees, or directly, the trees
p280
aVin the lines in that grass there,
p281
aVputting up the buffer zone, producing your compost,
p282
aVand then making sure that at every stage of that up growing forest
p283
aVthere are crops that can be used.
p284
aVIn the beginning, maybe pineapples and beans and corn;
p285
aVin the second phase, there will be bananas and papayas;
p286
aVlater on, there will be chocolate and chilies.
p287
aVAnd then slowly, the trees start taking over,
p288
aVbringing in produce from the fruits, from the timber, from the fuel wood.
p289
aVAnd finally, the sugar palm forest takes over
p290
aVand provides the people with permanent income.
p291
aa(lp292
VOn the top left, underneath those green stripes,
p293
aVyou see some white dots \u2014 those are actually individual pineapple plants
p294
aVthat you can see from space.
p295
aVAnd in that area we started growing some acacia trees
p296
aVthat you just saw before.
p297
aVSo this is after one year.
p298
aVAnd this is after two years.
p299
aVAnd that's green. If you look from the tower \u2014
p300
aVthis is when we start attacking the grass.
p301
aVWe plant in the seedlings
p302
aVmixed with the bananas, the papayas, all the crops for the local people,
p303
aVbut the trees are growing up fast in between as well.
p304
aVAnd three years later, 137 species of birds are living here.
p305
aa(lp306
V(Applause)
p307
aa(lp308
VSo we lowered air temperature three to five degrees Celsius.
p309
aVAir humidity is up 10 percent.
p310
aVCloud cover \u2014 I'm going to show it to you \u2014 is up.
p311
aVRainfall is up.
p312
aVAnd all these species and income.
p313
aa(lp314
VThis ecolodge that I built here,
p315
aVthree years before, was an empty, yellow field.
p316
aVThis transponder that we operate with the European Space Agency \u2014
p317
aVit gives us the benefit that every satellite that comes over to calibrate itself
p318
aVis taking a picture.
p319
aVThose pictures we use to analyze how much carbon, how the forest is developing,
p320
aVand we can monitor every tree using satellite images through our cooperation.
p321
aVWe can use these data now
p322
aVto provide other regions with recipes and the same technology.
p323
aVWe actually have it already with Google Earth.
p324
aVIf you would use a little bit of your technology to put tracking devices in trucks,
p325
aVand use Google Earth in combination with that,
p326
aVyou could directly tell what palm oil has been sustainably produced,
p327
aVwhich company is stealing the timber,
p328
aVand you could save so much more carbon
p329
aVthan with any measure of saving energy here.
p330
aa(lp331
VSo this is the Samboja Lestari area.
p332
aVYou measure how the trees grow back,
p333
aVbut you can also measure the biodiversity coming back.
p334
aVAnd biodiversity is an indicator of how much water can be balanced,
p335
aVhow many medicines can be kept here.
p336
aVAnd finally I made it into the rain machine
p337
aVbecause this forest is now creating its own rain.
p338
aVThis nearby city of Balikpapan has a big problem with water;
p339
aVit's 80 percent surrounded by seawater,
p340
aVand we have now a lot of intrusion there.
p341
aVNow we looked at the clouds above this forest;
p342
aVwe looked at the reforestation area, the semi-open area and the open area.
p343
aa(lp344
VAnd look at these images.
p345
aVI'll just run them very quickly through.
p346
aVIn the tropics, raindrops are not formed from ice crystals,
p347
aVwhich is the case in the temperate zones,
p348
aVyou need the trees with [unclear], chemicals that come out of the leaves of the trees
p349
aVthat initiate the raindrops.
p350
aVSo you create a cool place where clouds can accumulate,
p351
aVand you have the trees to initiate the rain.
p352
aVAnd look, there's now 11.2 percent more clouds \u2014
p353
aValready, after three years.
p354
aVIf you look at rainfall, it was already up 20 percent at that time.
p355
aVLet's look at the next year,
p356
aVand you can see that that trend is continuing.
p357
aVWhere at first we had a small cap of higher rainfall,
p358
aVthat cap is now widening and getting higher.
p359
aVAnd if we look at the rainfall pattern
p360
aVabove Samboja Lestari, it used to be the driest place,
p361
aVbut now you see consistently see a peak of rain forming there.
p362
aVSo you can actually change the climate.
p363
aVWhen there are trade winds of course the effect disappears,
p364
aVbut afterwards, as soon as the wind stabilizes,
p365
aVyou see again that the rainfall peaks come back above this area.
p366
aa(lp367
VSo to say it is hopeless is not the right thing to do,
p368
aVbecause we actually can make that difference
p369
aVif you integrate the various technologies.
p370
aVAnd it's nice to have the science, but it still depends mostly upon the people,
p371
aVon your education.
p372
aVWe have our farmer schools.
p373
aVBut the real success of course, is our band \u2014
p374
aVbecause if a baby is born, we will play, so everyone's our family
p375
aVand you don't make trouble with your family.
p376
aa(lp377
VThis is how it looks.
p378
aVWe have this road going around the area,
p379
aVwhich brings the people electricity and water from our own area.
p380
aVWe have the zone with the sugar palms,
p381
aVand then we have this fence with very thorny palms
p382
aVto keep the orangutans \u2014 that we provide with a place to live in the middle \u2014
p383
aVand the people apart.
p384
aVAnd inside, we have this area for reforestation
p385
aVas a gene bank to keep all that material alive,
p386
aVbecause for the last 12 years
p387
aVnot a single seedling of the tropical hardwood trees has grown up
p388
aVbecause the climatic triggers have disappeared.
p389
aVAll the seeds get eaten.
p390
aa(lp391
VSo now we do the monitoring on the inside \u2014
p392
aVfrom towers, satellites, ultralights.
p393
aVEach of the families that have sold their land now get a piece of land back.
p394
aVAnd it has two nice fences of tropical hardwood trees \u2014
p395
aVyou have the shade trees planted in year one,
p396
aVthen you underplanted with the sugar palms,
p397
aVand you plant this thorny fence.
p398
aVAnd after a few years, you can remove some of those shade trees.
p399
aVThe people get that acacia timber which we have preserved with the bamboo peel,
p400
aVand they can build a house, they have some fuel wood to cook with.
p401
aVAnd they can start producing from the trees as many as they like.
p402
aVThey have enough income for three families.
p403
aVBut whatever you do in that program, it has to be fully supported by the people,
p404
aVmeaning that you also have to adjust it to the local, cultural values.
p405
aVThere is no simple one recipe for one place.
p406
aa(lp407
VYou also have to make sure that it is very difficult to corrupt \u2014
p408
aVthat it's transparent.
p409
aVLike here, in Samboja Lestari,
p410
aVwe divide that ring in groups of 20 families.
p411
aVIf one member trespasses the agreement,
p412
aVand does cut down trees,
p413
aVthe other 19 members have to decide what's going to happen to him.
p414
aVIf the group doesn't take action,
p415
aVthe other 33 groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group
p416
aVthat doesn't comply with those great deals that we are offering them.
p417
aa(lp418
VIn North Sulawesi it is the cooperative \u2014
p419
aVthey have a democratic culture there,
p420
aVso there you can use the local justice system to protect your system.
p421
aVIn summary, if you look at it, in year one the people can sell their land
p422
aVto get income, but they get jobs back in the construction and the reforestation,
p423
aVthe working with the orangutans, and they can use the waste wood to make handicraft.
p424

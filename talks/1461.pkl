VThe great texts of the ancient world
p5
aVdon't survive to us in their original form.
p6
aVThey survive because medieval scribes copied them
p7
aVand copied them and copied them.
p8
aVAnd so it is with Archimedes,
p9
aVthe great Greek mathematician.
p10
aa(lp11
VEverything we know about Archimedes as a mathematician
p12
aVwe know about because of just three books,
p13
aVand they're called A, B and C.
p14
aVAnd A was lost by an Italian humanist in 1564.
p15
aVAnd B was last heard of in the Pope's Library
p16
aVabout a hundred miles north of Rome in Viterbo in 1311.
p17
aVNow Codex C was only discovered in 1906,
p18
aVand it landed on my desk in Baltimore
p19
aVon the 19th of January, 1999.
p20
aVAnd this is Codex C here.
p21
aa(lp22
VNow Codex C is actually buried in this book.
p23
aVIt's buried treasure.
p24
aVBecause this book is actually a prayer book.
p25
aVIt was finished by a guy called Johannes Myrones
p26
aVon the 14th of April, 1229.
p27
aVAnd to make his prayer book he used parchment.
p28
aVBut he didn't use new parchment,
p29
aVhe used parchment recycled from earlier manuscripts,
p30
aVand there were seven of them.
p31
aVAnd Archimedes Codex C was just one of those seven.
p32
aVHe took apart the Archimedes manuscript and the other seven manuscripts.
p33
aVHe erased all of their texts,
p34
aVand then he cut the sheets down in the middle,
p35
aVhe shuffled them up,
p36
aVand he rotated them 90 degrees,
p37
aVand he wrote prayers on top of these books.
p38
aVAnd essentially these seven manuscripts
p39
aVdisappeared for 700 years, and we have a prayer book.
p40
aa(lp41
VThe prayer book was discovered by this guy,
p42
aVJohan Ludvig Heiberg, in 1906.
p43
aVAnd with just a magnifying glass,
p44
aVhe transcribed as much of the text as he could.
p45
aVAnd the thing is that he found two texts in this manuscript
p46
aVthat were unique texts.
p47
aVThey weren't in A and B at all;
p48
aVthey were completely new texts by Archimedes,
p49
aVand they were called "The Method" and "The Stomachion."
p50
aVAnd it became a world famous manuscript.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow it should be clear by now
p53
aVthat this book is in bad condition.
p54
aVIt got in worse condition in the 20th century
p55
aVafter Heiberg saw it.
p56
aVForgeries were painted over it,
p57
aVand it suffered very badly from mold.
p58
aVThis book is the definition of a write-off.
p59
aVIt's the sort of book
p60
aVthat you thought would be in an institution.
p61
aVBut it's not in an institution,
p62
aVit was bought by a private owner in 1998.
p63
aa(lp64
VWhy did he buy this book?
p65
aVBecause he wanted to make that which was fragile safe.
p66
aVHe wanted to make that which was unique ubiquitous.
p67
aVHe wanted to make that which was expensive free.
p68
aVAnd he wanted to do this as a matter of principle.
p69
aVBecause not many people are really going to read Archimedes in ancient Greek,
p70
aVbut they should have the chance to do it.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo he gathered around himself the friends of Archimedes,
p73
aVand he promised to pay for all the work.
p74
aVAnd it was an expensive job,
p75
aVbut actually it wouldn't be as much as you think
p76
aVbecause these people, they didn't come from money,
p77
aVthey came from Archimedes.
p78
aVAnd they came from all sorts of different backgrounds.
p79
aVThey came from particle physics,
p80
aVthey came from classical philology,
p81
aVthey came from book conservation,
p82
aVthey came from ancient mathematics,
p83
aVthey came from data management,
p84
aVthey came from scientific imaging and program management.
p85
aVAnd they got together to work on this manuscript.
p86
aa(lp87
VThe first problem was a conservation problem.
p88
aVAnd this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with:
p89
aVThere was glue on the spine of the book.
p90
aVAnd if you look at this photograph carefully,
p91
aVthe bottom half of this is rather brown.
p92
aVAnd that glue is hide glue.
p93
aVNow if you're a conservator,
p94
aVyou can take off this glue reasonably easily.
p95
aVThe top half is Elmer's wood glue.
p96
aVIt's polyvinyl acetate emulsion
p97
aVthat doesn't dissolve in water once it's dry.
p98
aVAnd it's much tougher than the parchment that it was written on.
p99
aVAnd so before we could start imaging Archimedes,
p100
aVwe had to take this book apart.
p101
aVSo it took four years to take apart.
p102
aVAnd this is a rare action shot, ladies and gentlemen.
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VAnother thing is that we had to get rid of all the wax,
p107
aVbecause this was used in the liturgical services
p108
aVof the Greek Orthodox Church
p109
aVand they'd used candle wax.
p110
aVAnd the candle wax was dirty,
p111
aVand we couldn't image through the wax.
p112
aVSo very carefully we had to mechanically scrape off all the wax.
p113
aa(lp114
VIt's hard to tell you exactly
p115
aVhow bad this condition of this book is,
p116
aVbut it came out in little bits very often.
p117
aVAnd normally in a book, you wouldn't worry about the little bits,
p118
aVbut these little bits might contain unique Archimedes text.
p119
aVSo, tiny fragments
p120
aVwe actually managed to put back in the right place.
p121
aa(lp122
VThen, having done that, we started to image the manuscript.
p123
aVAnd we imaged the manuscript
p124
aVin 14 different wavebands of light.
p125
aVBecause if you look at something in different wavebands of light,
p126
aVyou see different things.
p127
aVAnd here is an image of a page
p128
aVimaged in 14 different wavebands of light.
p129
aa(lp130
VBut none of them worked.
p131
aVSo what we did was we processed the images together,
p132
aVand we put two images into one blank screen.
p133
aVAnd here are two different images of the Archimedes manuscript.
p134
aVAnd the image on the left
p135
aVis the normal red image.
p136
aVAnd the image on the right is an ultraviolet image.
p137
aVAnd in the image on the right
p138
aVyou might be able to see some of the Archimedes writing.
p139
aVIf you merge them together into one digital canvas,
p140
aVthe parchment is bright in both images
p141
aVand it comes out bright.
p142
aVThe prayer book is dark in both images
p143
aVand it comes out dark.
p144
aVThe Archimedes text is dark in one image and bright in another.
p145
aVAnd it'll come out dark but red,
p146
aVand then you can start to read it rather clearly.
p147
aVAnd that's what it looks like.
p148
aa(lp149
VNow that's a before and after image,
p150
aVbut you don't read the image on the screen like that.
p151
aVYou zoom in and you zoom in
p152
aVand you zoom in and you zoom in,
p153
aVand you can just read it now.
p154
aa(lp155
V(Applause)
p156
aa(lp157
VIf you process the same two images in a different way,
p158
aVyou can actually get rid of the prayer book text.
p159
aVAnd this is terribly important,
p160
aVbecause the diagrams in the manuscript
p161
aVare the unique source for the diagrams
p162
aVthat Archimedes drew in the sand in the fourth century B.C.
p163
aVAnd there we are, I can give them to you.
p164
aa(lp165
VWith this kind of imaging \u2014
p166
aVthis kind of infrared, ultraviolet, invisible light imaging \u2014
p167
aVwe were never going to image through the gold ground forgeries.
p168
aVHow were we going to do that?
p169
aVWell we took the manuscript,
p170
aVand we decided to image it in X-ray fluorescence imaging.
p171
aVSo an X-ray comes in in the diagram on the left
p172
aVand it knocks out an electron from the inner shell of an atom.
p173
aVAnd that electron disappears.
p174
aVAnd as it disappears, an electron from a shell farther out
p175
aVjumps in and takes its place.
p176
aVAnd when it takes its place,
p177
aVit sheds electromagnetic radiation.
p178
aVIt sheds an X-ray.
p179
aVAnd this X-ray is specific in its wavelength
p180
aVto the atom that it hits.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd what we wanted to get
p183
aVwas the iron.
p184
aVBecause the ink was written in iron.
p185
aVAnd if we can map
p186
aVwhere this X-ray that comes out, where it comes from,
p187
aVwe can map all the iron on the page,
p188
aVthen theoretically we can read the image.
p189
aa(lp190
VThe thing is that you need a very powerful light source to do this.
p191
aVSo we took it to the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory
p192
aVin California,
p193
aVwhich is a particle accelerator.
p194
aVElectrons go around one way,
p195
aVpositrons go around the other.
p196
aVThey meet in the middle,
p197
aVand they create subatomic particles
p198
aVlike the charm quark and the tau lepton.
p199
aVNow we weren't actually going to put Archimedes in that beam.
p200
aVBut as the electrons go round at the speed of light,
p201
aVthey shed X-rays.
p202
aVAnd this is the most powerful light source in the solar system.
p203
aVThis is called synchrotron radiation,
p204
aVand it's normally used to look at things
p205
aVlike proteins and that sort of thing.
p206
aVBut we wanted it to look at atoms, at iron atoms,
p207
aVso that we could read the page from before and after.
p208
aVAnd lo and behold, we found that we could do it.
p209
aVIt took about 17 minutes to do a single page.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo what did we discover?
p212
aVWell one of the unique texts in Archimedes
p213
aVis called "The Stomachion."
p214
aVAnd this didn't exist in Codices A and B.
p215
aVAnd we knew that it involved this square.
p216
aVAnd this is a perfect square,
p217
aVand it's divided into 14 bits.
p218
aVBut no one knew what Archimedes was doing with these 14 bits.
p219
aVAnd now we think we know.
p220
aVHe was trying to work out
p221
aVhow many ways you can recombine those 14 bits
p222
aVand still make a perfect square.
p223
aVAnyone want to guess the answer?
p224
aVIt's 17,152 divided into 536 families.
p225
aVAnd the important point about this
p226
aVis that it's the earliest study in combinatorics in mathematics.
p227
aVAnd combinatorics is a wonderful and interesting branch of mathematics.
p228
aa(lp229
VThe really astonishing thing though about this manuscript
p230
aVis that we looked at the other manuscripts
p231
aVthat the palimpsester had made,
p232
aVthe scribe had made his book out of,
p233
aVand one of them was a manuscript containing text by Hyperides.
p234
aVNow Hyperides was an Athenian orator from the fourth century B.C.
p235
aVHe was an exact contemporary of Demosthenes.
p236
aVAnd in 338 B.C. he and Demosthenes together
p237
aVdecided that they wanted to stand up
p238
aVto the military might of Philip of Macedon.
p239
aVSo Athens and Thebes went out to fight Philip of Macedon.
p240
aVThis was a bad idea,
p241
aVbecause Philip of Macedon had a son called Alexander the Great,
p242
aVand they lost the battle of Chaeronea.
p243
aa(lp244
VAlexander the Great went on to conquer the known world;
p245
aVHyperides found himself on trial for treason.
p246
aVAnd this is the speech that he gave when he was on trial \u2014
p247
aVand it's a great speech:
p248
aV"Best of all," he says, "is to win.
p249
aVBut if you can't win,
p250
aVthen you should fight for a noble cause,
p251
aVbecause then you'll be remembered.
p252
aVConsider the Spartans.
p253
aVThey won enumerable victories,
p254
aVbut no one remembers what they are
p255
aVbecause they were all fought for selfish ends.
p256
aVThe one battle that the Spartans fought that everybody remembers
p257
aVis the the battle of Thermopylae
p258
aVwhere they were butchered to a man,
p259
aVbut fought for the freedom of Greece."
p260
aVIt was such a great speech
p261
aVthat the Athenian law courts let him off.
p262
aVHe lived for another 10 years,
p263
aVthen the Macedonian faction caught up with him.
p264
aVThey cut out his tongue in mockery of his oratory,
p265
aVand no one knows what they did with his body.
p266
aVSo this is the discovery of a lost voice from antiquity,
p267
aVspeaking to us, not from the grave,
p268
aVbecause his grave doesn't exist,
p269
aVbut from the Athenian law courts.
p270
aa(lp271
VNow I should say at this point
p272
aVthat normally when you're looking
p273
aVat medieval manuscripts that have been scraped off,
p274
aVyou don't find unique texts.
p275
aVAnd to find two in one manuscript is really something.
p276
aVTo find three is completely weird.
p277
aVAnd we found three.
p278
aa(lp279
VAristotle's "Categories"
p280
aVis one of the foundational texts of Western philosophy.
p281
aVAnd we found a third century A.D. commentary on it,
p282
aVpossibly by Galen and probably by Porphyry.
p283
aa(lp284
VNow all this data that we collected,
p285
aVall the images, all the raw images,
p286
aVall the transcriptions that we made and that sort of thing
p287
aVhave been put online under a Creative Commons license
p288
aVfor anyone to use for any commercial purpose.
p289
aa(lp290
V(Applause)
p291
aa(lp292
VWhy did the owner of the manuscript do this?
p293
aVHe did this because he understands data as well as books.
p294
aVNow the thing to do with books,
p295
aVif you want to ensure their long-term utility,
p296
aVis to hide them away in closets
p297
aVand let very few people look at them.
p298
aVThe thing to do with data, if you want it to survive,
p299
aVis to let it out and have everybody have it
p300
aVwith as little control on that data as possible.
p301
aVAnd that's what he did.
p302
aa(lp303
VAnd institutions can learn from this.
p304
aVBecause institutions at the moment
p305
aVconfine their data with copyright restrictions and that sort of thing.
p306
aVAnd if you want to look at medieval manuscripts on the Web,
p307
aVat the moment you have to go to the National Library of Y's site
p308
aVor the University Library of X's site,
p309
aVwhich is about the most boring way
p310
aVin which you can deal with digital data.
p311
aVWhat you want to do is to aggregate it all together.
p312
aa(lp313
VBecause the Web of the ancient manuscripts of the future
p314
aVisn't going to be built by institutions.
p315
aVIt's going to be built by users,
p316
aVby people who get this data together,
p317
aVby people who want to aggregate all sorts of maps
p318
aVfrom wherever they come from,
p319
aVall sorts of medieval romances
p320
aVfrom wherever they come from,
p321
aVpeople who just want to curate their own glorious selection
p322
aVof beautiful things.
p323
aVAnd that is the future of the Web.
p324
aVAnd it's an attractive and beautiful future,
p325
aVif only we can make it happen.
p326
aa(lp327
VNow we at the Walters Art Museum have followed this example,
p328
aVand we have put up all our manuscripts on the Web
p329
aVfor people to enjoy \u2014
p330
aVall the raw data, all the descriptions, all the metadata.
p331
aVunder a Creative Commons license.
p332
aVNow the Walters Art Museum is a small museum
p333
aVand it has beautiful manuscripts,
p334
aVbut the data is fantastic.
p335
aVAnd the result of this
p336
aVis that if you do a Google search on images right now
p337
aVand you type in "Illuminated manuscript Koran" for example,
p338
aV24 of the 28 images you'll find come from my institution.
p339
aa(lp340
V(Applause)
p341
aa(lp342
VNow, let's think about this for a minute.
p343
aVWhat's in it for the institution?
p344
aVThere are all sorts of things that are in it for the institution.
p345
aVYou can talk about the Humanities and that sort of thing,
p346
aVbut let's talk about selfish things.
p347
aVBecause what's really in it for the institution is this:
p348
aVNow why do people go to the Louvre?
p349
aVThey go to see the Mona Lisa.
p350
aVWhy do they go to see the Mona Lisa?
p351
aVBecause they already know what she looks like.
p352
aVAnd they know what she looks like
p353
aVbecause they've seen pictures of her absolutely everywhere.
p354
aa(lp355
VNow, there is no need
p356
aVfor these restrictions at all.
p357
aVAnd I think that institutions should stand up
p358
aVand release all their data under unrestricted licenses,
p359
aVand it would be a great benefit to everybody.
p360
aVWhy don't we just let everybody have access to this data
p361
aVand curate their own collection
p362
aVof ancient knowledge and wonderful and beautiful things
p363
aVand increase the beauty and the cultural significance
p364
aVof the Internet.
p365
aa(lp366
VThank you very much indeed.

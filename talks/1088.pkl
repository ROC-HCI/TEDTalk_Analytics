VThere's actually a major health crisis today
p5
aVin terms of the shortage of organs.
p6
aVThe fact is that we're living longer.
p7
aVMedicine has done a much better job
p8
aVof making us live longer,
p9
aVand the problem is, as we age,
p10
aVour organs tend to fail more,
p11
aVand so currently
p12
aVthere are not enough organs to go around.
p13
aVIn fact, in the last 10 years,
p14
aVthe number of patients requiring an organ has doubled,
p15
aVwhile in the same time,
p16
aVthe actual number of transplants has barely gone up.
p17
aVSo this is now a public health crisis.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo that's where this field comes in
p20
aVthat we call the field of regenerative medicine.
p21
aVIt really involves many different areas.
p22
aVYou can use, actually, scaffolds,
p23
aVbiomaterials \u2014
p24
aVthey're like the piece of your blouse or your shirt \u2014
p25
aVbut specific materials you can actually implant in patients
p26
aVand they will do well and help you regenerate.
p27
aVOr we can use cells alone,
p28
aVeither your very own cells
p29
aVor different stem cell populations.
p30
aVOr we can use both.
p31
aVWe can use, actually, biomaterials
p32
aVand the cells together.
p33
aVAnd that's where the field is today.
p34
aa(lp35
VBut it's actually not a new field.
p36
aVInterestingly, this is a book
p37
aVthat was published back in 1938.
p38
aVIt's titled "The Culture of Organs."
p39
aVThe first author, Alexis Carrel, a Nobel Prize winner.
p40
aVHe actually devised some of the same technologies
p41
aVused today for suturing blood vessels,
p42
aVand some of the blood vessel grafts we use today
p43
aVwere actually designed by Alexis.
p44
aVBut I want you to note his co-author:
p45
aVCharles Lindbergh.
p46
aVThat's the same Charles Lindbergh
p47
aVwho actually spent the rest of his life
p48
aVworking with Alexis
p49
aVat the Rockefeller Institute in New York
p50
aVin the area of the culture of organs.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo if the field's been around for so long,
p53
aVwhy so few clinical advances?
p54
aVAnd that really has to do to many different challenges.
p55
aVBut if I were to point to three challenges,
p56
aVthe first one is actually the design of materials
p57
aVthat could go in your body
p58
aVand do well over time.
p59
aVAnd many advances now,
p60
aVwe can do that fairly readily.
p61
aVThe second challenge was cells.
p62
aVWe could not get enough of your cells to grow outside of your body.
p63
aVOver the last 20 years, we've basically tackled that.
p64
aVMany scientists can now grow many different types of cells.
p65
aVPlus we have stem cells.
p66
aVBut even now, 2011,
p67
aVthere's still certain cells that we just can't grow from the patient.
p68
aVLiver cells, nerve cells, pancreatic cells \u2014
p69
aVwe still can't grow them even today.
p70
aVAnd the third challenge is vascularity,
p71
aVthe actual supply of blood
p72
aVto allow those organs or tissues to survive
p73
aVonce we regenerate them.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo we can actually use biomaterials now.
p76
aVThis is actually a biomaterial.
p77
aVWe can weave them, knit them, or we can make them like you see here.
p78
aVThis is actually like a cotton candy machine.
p79
aVYou saw the spray going in.
p80
aVThat was like the fibers of the cotton candy
p81
aVcreating this structure, this tubularized structure,
p82
aVwhich is a biomaterial
p83
aVthat we can then use
p84
aVto help your body regenerate
p85
aVusing your very own cells to do so.
p86
aVAnd that's exactly what we did here.
p87
aa(lp88
VThis is actually a patient
p89
aVwho [was] presented with a deceased organ,
p90
aVand we then created one of these smart biomaterials,
p91
aVand then we then used that smart biomaterial
p92
aVto replace and repair
p93
aVthat patient's structure.
p94
aVWhat we did was we actually
p95
aVused the biomaterial as a bridge
p96
aVso that the cells in the organ
p97
aVcould walk on that bridge, if you will,
p98
aVand help to bridge the gap
p99
aVto regenerate that tissue.
p100
aVAnd you see that patient now six months after
p101
aVwith an X-ray showing you the regenerated tissue,
p102
aVwhich is fully regenerated
p103
aVwhen you analyze it under the microscope.
p104
aVWe can also use cells alone.
p105
aVThese are actually cells that we obtained.
p106
aVThese are stem cells that we create from specific sources,
p107
aVand we can drive them to become heart cells,
p108
aVand they start beating in culture.
p109
aVSo they know what to do.
p110
aVThe cells genetically know what to do,
p111
aVand they start beating together.
p112
aVNow today, many clinical trials
p113
aVare using different kinds of stem cells
p114
aVfor heart disease.
p115
aVSo that's actually now in patients.
p116
aa(lp117
VOr if we're going to use larger structures
p118
aVto replace larger structures,
p119
aVwe can then use the patient's own cells,
p120
aVor some cell population,
p121
aVand the biomaterials,
p122
aVthe scaffolds, together.
p123
aVSo the concept here:
p124
aVso if you do have a deceased or injured organ,
p125
aVwe take a very small piece of that tissue,
p126
aVless than half the size of a postage stamp.
p127
aVWe then tease the cells apart,
p128
aVwe grow the cells outside the body.
p129
aVWe then take a scaffold, a biomaterial \u2014
p130
aVagain, looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt \u2014
p131
aVwe then shape that material,
p132
aVand we then use those cells to coat that material
p133
aVone layer at a time \u2014
p134
aVvery much like baking a layer cake, if you will.
p135
aVWe then place it in an oven-like device,
p136
aVand we're able to create that structure
p137
aVand bring it out.
p138
aVThis is actually a heart valve
p139
aVthat we've engineered,
p140
aVand you can see here, we have the structure of the heart valve
p141
aVand we've seeded that with cells,
p142
aVand then we exercise it.
p143
aVSo you see the leaflets opening and closing \u2014
p144
aVof this heart valve
p145
aVthat's currently being used experimentally
p146
aVto try to get it to further studies.
p147
aa(lp148
VAnother technology
p149
aVthat we have used in patients
p150
aVactually involves bladders.
p151
aVWe actually take a very small piece of the bladder from the patient \u2014
p152
aVless than half the size of a postage stamp.
p153
aVWe then grow the cells outside the body,
p154
aVtake the scaffold, coat the scaffold with the cells \u2014
p155
aVthe patient's own cells, two different cell types.
p156
aVWe then put it in this oven-like device.
p157
aVIt has the same conditions as the human body \u2014
p158
aV37 degrees centigrade, 95 percent oxygen.
p159
aVA few weeks later, you have your engineered organ
p160
aVthat we're able to implant back into the patient.
p161
aVFor these specific patients, we actually just suture these materials.
p162
aVWe use three-dimensional imagining analysis,
p163
aVbut we actually created these biomaterials by hand.
p164
aa(lp165
VBut we now have better ways
p166
aVto create these structures with the cells.
p167
aVWe use now some type of technologies,
p168
aVwhere for solid organs, for example,
p169
aVlike the liver,
p170
aVwhat we do is we take discard livers.
p171
aVAs you know, a lot of organs are actually discarded, not used.
p172
aVSo we can take these liver structures,
p173
aVwhich are not going to be used,
p174
aVand we then put them in a washing machine-like structure
p175
aVthat will allow the cells to be washed away.
p176
aVTwo weeks later,
p177
aVyou have something that looks like a liver.
p178
aVYou can hold it like a liver,
p179
aVbut it has no cells; it's just a skeleton of the liver.
p180
aVAnd we then can re-perfuse the liver with cells,
p181
aVpreserving the blood vessel tree.
p182
aVSo we actually perfuse first the blood vessel tree
p183
aVwith the patient's own blood vessel cells,
p184
aVand we then infiltrate the parenchyma with the liver cells.
p185
aVAnd we now have been able just to show
p186
aVthe creation of human liver tissue
p187
aVjust this past month
p188
aVusing this technology.
p189
aa(lp190
VAnother technology that we've used
p191
aVis actually that of printing.
p192
aVThis is actually a desktop inkjet printer,
p193
aVbut instead of using ink,
p194
aVwe're using cells.
p195
aVAnd you can actually see here the printhead
p196
aVgoing through and printing this structure,
p197
aVand it takes about 40 minutes to print this structure.
p198
aVAnd there's a 3D elevator
p199
aVthat then actually goes down one layer at a time
p200
aVeach time the printhead goes through.
p201
aVAnd then finally you're able to get that structure out.
p202
aVYou can pop that structure out of the printer and implant it.
p203
aVAnd this is actually a piece of bone
p204
aVthat I'm going to show you in this slide
p205
aVthat was actually created with this desktop printer
p206
aVand implanted as you see here.
p207
aVThat was all new bone that was implanted
p208
aVusing these techniques.
p209
aa(lp210
VAnother more advanced technology we're looking at right now,
p211
aVour next generation of technologies,
p212
aVare more sophisticated printers.
p213
aVThis particular printer we're designing now
p214
aVis actually one where we print right on the patient.
p215
aVSo what you see here \u2014
p216
aVI know it sounds funny,
p217
aVbut that's the way it works.
p218
aVBecause in reality, what you want to do
p219
aVis you actually want to have the patient on the bed with the wound,
p220
aVand you have a scanner,
p221
aVbasically like a flatbed scanner.
p222
aVThat's what you see here on the right side.
p223
aVYou see a scanner technology
p224
aVthat first scans the wound on the patient
p225
aVand then it comes back with the printheads
p226
aVactually printing the layers that you require
p227
aVon the patients themselves.
p228
aa(lp229
VThis is how it actually works.
p230
aVHere's the scanner going through,
p231
aVscanning the wound.
p232
aVOnce it's scanned,
p233
aVit sends information in the correct layers of cells
p234
aVwhere they need to be.
p235
aVAnd now you're going to see here
p236
aVa demo of this actually being done
p237
aVin a representative wound.
p238
aVAnd we actually do this with a gel so that you can lift the gel material.
p239
aVSo once those cells are on the patient
p240
aVthey will stick where they need to be.
p241
aVAnd this is actually new technology
p242
aVstill under development.
p243
aa(lp244
VWe're also working on more sophisticated printers.
p245
aVBecause in reality, our biggest challenge
p246
aVare the solid organs.
p247
aVI don't know if you realize this,
p248
aVbut 90 percent of the patients on the transplant list
p249
aVare actually waiting for a kidney.
p250
aVPatients are dying every day
p251
aVbecause we don't have enough of those organs to go around.
p252
aVSo this is more challenging \u2014
p253
aVlarge organ, vascular,
p254
aVa lot of blood vessel supply,
p255
aVa lot of cells present.
p256
aVSo the strategy here is \u2014
p257
aVthis is actually a CT scan, an X-ray \u2014
p258
aVand we go layer by layer,
p259
aVusing computerized morphometric imaging analysis
p260
aVand 3D reconstruction
p261
aVto get right down to those patient's own kidneys.
p262
aVWe then are able to actually image those,
p263
aVdo 360 degree rotation
p264
aVto analyze the kidney
p265
aVin its full volumetric characteristics,
p266
aVand we then are able
p267
aVto actually take this information
p268
aVand then scan this
p269
aVin a printing computerized form.
p270
aVSo we go layer by layer through the organ,
p271
aVanalyzing each layer as we go through the organ,
p272
aVand we then are able to send that information, as you see here,
p273
aVthrough the computer
p274
aVand actually design the organ
p275
aVfor the patient.
p276
aVThis actually shows the actual printer.
p277
aVAnd this actually shows that printing.
p278
aa(lp279
VIn fact, we actually have the printer right here.
p280
aVSo while we've been talking today,
p281
aVyou can actually see the printer
p282
aVback here in the back stage.
p283
aVThat's actually the actual printer right now,
p284
aVand that's been printing this kidney structure
p285
aVthat you see here.
p286
aVIt takes about seven hours to print a kidney,
p287
aVso this is about three hours into it now.
p288
aVAnd Dr. Kang's going to walk onstage right now,
p289
aVand we're actually going to show you one of these kidneys
p290
aVthat we printed a little bit earlier today.
p291
aVPut a pair of gloves here.
p292
aVThank you.
p293
aVGo backwards.
p294
aVSo, these gloves are a little bit small on me, but here it is.
p295
aVYou can actually see that kidney
p296
aVas it was printed earlier today.
p297
aa(lp298
V(Applause)
p299
aa(lp300
VHas a little bit of consistency to it.
p301
aVThis is Dr. Kang who's been working with us on this project,
p302
aVand part of our team.
p303
aVThank you, Dr. Kang. I appreciate it.
p304
aa(lp305
V(Applause)
p306
aa(lp307
VSo this is actually a new generation.
p308
aVThis is actually the printer that you see here onstage.
p309
aVAnd this is actually a new technology we're working on now.
p310
aVIn reality, we now have a long history of doing this.
p311
aVI'm going to share with you a clip
p312
aVin terms of technology we have had in patients now for a while.
p313
aa(lp314
VAnd this is actually a very brief clip \u2014
p315
aVonly about 30 seconds \u2014
p316
aVof a patient who actually received an organ.
p317
aa(lp318
V(Video) Luke Massella: I was really sick. I could barely get out of bed.
p319
aVI was missing school. It was pretty much miserable.
p320
aVI couldn't go out
p321
aVand play basketball at recess
p322
aVwithout feeling like I was going to pass out
p323
aVwhen I got back inside.
p324
aVI felt so sick.
p325
aVI was facing basically a lifetime of dialysis,
p326
aVand I don't even like to think about what my life would be like
p327
aVif I was on that.
p328
aVSo after the surgery,
p329
aVlife got a lot better for me.
p330
aVI was able to do more things.
p331
aVI was able to wrestle in high school.
p332
aVI became the captain of the team, and that was great.
p333
aVI was able to be a normal kid with my friends.
p334
aVAnd because they used my own cells to build this bladder,
p335
aVit's going to be with me.
p336
aVI've got it for life, so I'm all set.
p337
aa(lp338
V(Applause)
p339
aa(lp340
VJuan Enriquez: These experiments sometimes work,
p341
aVand it's very cool when they do.
p342
aVLuke, come up please.
p343
aa(lp344
V(Applause)
p345
aa(lp346
VSo Luke, before last night,
p347
aVwhen's the last time you saw Tony?
p348
aa(lp349
VLM: Ten years ago, when I had my surgery \u2014
p350
aVand it's really great to see him.
p351
aa(lp352
V(Laughter)
p353
aa(lp354
V(Applause)
p355
aa(lp356
VJE: And tell us a little bit about what you're doing.
p357
aa(lp358
VLM: Well right now I'm in college at the University of Connecticut.
p359
aVI'm a sophomore and studying communications, TV and mass media,
p360
aVand basically trying to live life like a normal kid,
p361
aVwhich I always wanted growing up.
p362
aVBut it was hard to do that when I was born with spina bifida
p363
aVand my kidneys and bladder weren't working.
p364
aVI went through about 16 surgeries,
p365
aVand it seemed impossible to do that
p366
aVwhen I was in kidney failure when I was 10.
p367
aVAnd this surgery came along
p368
aVand basically made me who I am today
p369
aVand saved my life.
p370
aa(lp371
V(Applause)
p372
aa(lp373
VJE: And Tony's done hundreds of these?
p374
aa(lp375
VLM: What I know from, he's working really hard in his lab
p376
aVand coming up with crazy stuff.
p377
aVI know I was one of the first 10 people to have this surgery.
p378
aVAnd when I was 10, I didn't realize how amazing it was.
p379
aVI was a little kid, and I was like,
p380
aV"Yeah. I'll have that. I'll have that surgery."
p381
aV(Laughter)
p382
aVAll I wanted to do was to get better,
p383
aVand I didn't realize how amazing it really was until now that I'm older
p384
aVand I see the amazing things that he's doing.
p385
aa(lp386
VJE: When you got this call out of the blue \u2014
p387
aVTony's really shy,
p388
aVand it took a lot of convincing
p389
aVto get somebody as modest as Tony
p390
aVto allow us to bring Luke.
p391
aVSo Luke, you go to your communications professors \u2014
p392
aVyou're majoring in communications \u2014
p393
aVand you ask them for permission to come to TED,
p394
aVwhich might have a little bit to do with communications,
p395
aVand what was their reaction?
p396
aa(lp397
VLM: Most of my professors were all for it,
p398
aVand they said, "Bring pictures
p399
aVand show me the clips online," and "I'm happy for you."
p400
aVThere were a couple that were a little stubborn,
p401
aVbut I had to talk to them.
p402
aVI pulled them aside.
p403
aa(lp404
VJE: Well, it's an honor and a privilege to meet you.
p405
aVThank you so much. (LM: Thank you so much.)
p406
aa(lp407
VJE: Thank you, Tony.

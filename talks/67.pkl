VAs other speakers have said, it's a rather daunting experience \u2014
p5
aVa particularly daunting experience \u2014 to be speaking in front of this audience.
p6
aVBut unlike the other speakers, I'm not going to tell you about
p7
aVthe mysteries of the universe, or the wonders of evolution,
p8
aVor the really clever, innovative ways people are attacking
p9
aVthe major inequalities in our world.
p10
aVOr even the challenges of nation-states in the modern global economy.
p11
aVMy brief, as you've just heard, is to tell you about statistics \u2014
p12
aVand, to be more precise, to tell you some exciting things about statistics.
p13
aVAnd that's \u2014
p14
aV(Laughter)
p15
aV\u2014 that's rather more challenging
p16
aVthan all the speakers before me and all the ones coming after me.
p17
aV(Laughter)
p18
aVOne of my senior colleagues told me, when I was a youngster in this profession,
p19
aVrather proudly, that statisticians were people who liked figures
p20
aVbut didn't have the personality skills to become accountants.
p21
aV(Laughter)
p22
aVAnd there's another in-joke among statisticians, and that's,
p23
aV"How do you tell the introverted statistician from the extroverted statistician?"
p24
aVTo which the answer is,
p25
aV"The extroverted statistician's the one who looks at the other person's shoes."
p26
aV(Laughter)
p27
aVBut I want to tell you something useful \u2014 and here it is, so concentrate now.
p28
aVThis evening, there's a reception in the University's Museum of Natural History.
p29
aVAnd it's a wonderful setting, as I hope you'll find,
p30
aVand a great icon to the best of the Victorian tradition.
p31
aVIt's very unlikely \u2014 in this special setting, and this collection of people \u2014
p32
aVbut you might just find yourself talking to someone you'd rather wish that you weren't.
p33
aVSo here's what you do.
p34
aVWhen they say to you, "What do you do?" \u2014 you say, "I'm a statistician."
p35
aV(Laughter)
p36
aVWell, except they've been pre-warned now, and they'll know you're making it up.
p37
aVAnd then one of two things will happen.
p38
aVThey'll either discover their long-lost cousin in the other corner of the room
p39
aVand run over and talk to them.
p40
aVOr they'll suddenly become parched and/or hungry \u2014 and often both \u2014
p41
aVand sprint off for a drink and some food.
p42
aVAnd you'll be left in peace to talk to the person you really want to talk to.
p43
aa(lp44
VIt's one of the challenges in our profession to try and explain what we do.
p45
aVWe're not top on people's lists for dinner party guests and conversations and so on.
p46
aVAnd it's something I've never really found a good way of doing.
p47
aVBut my wife \u2014 who was then my girlfriend \u2014
p48
aVmanaged it much better than I've ever been able to.
p49
aVMany years ago, when we first started going out, she was working for the BBC in Britain,
p50
aVand I was, at that stage, working in America.
p51
aVI was coming back to visit her.
p52
aVShe told this to one of her colleagues, who said, "Well, what does your boyfriend do?"
p53
aVSarah thought quite hard about the things I'd explained \u2014
p54
aVand she concentrated, in those days, on listening.
p55
aV(Laughter)
p56
aVDon't tell her I said that.
p57
aVAnd she was thinking about the work I did developing mathematical models
p58
aVfor understanding evolution and modern genetics.
p59
aVSo when her colleague said, "What does he do?"
p60
aVShe paused and said, "He models things."
p61
aV(Laughter)
p62
aVWell, her colleague suddenly got much more interested than I had any right to expect
p63
aVand went on and said, "What does he model?"
p64
aVWell, Sarah thought a little bit more about my work and said, "Genes."
p65
aV(Laughter)
p66
aV"He models genes."
p67
aa(lp68
VThat is my first love, and that's what I'll tell you a little bit about.
p69
aVWhat I want to do more generally is to get you thinking about
p70
aVthe place of uncertainty and randomness and chance in our world,
p71
aVand how we react to that, and how well we do or don't think about it.
p72
aVSo you've had a pretty easy time up till now \u2014
p73
aVa few laughs, and all that kind of thing \u2014 in the talks to date.
p74
aVYou've got to think, and I'm going to ask you some questions.
p75
aVSo here's the scene for the first question I'm going to ask you.
p76
aVCan you imagine tossing a coin successively?
p77
aVAnd for some reason \u2014 which shall remain rather vague \u2014
p78
aVwe're interested in a particular pattern.
p79
aVHere's one \u2014 a head, followed by a tail, followed by a tail.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo suppose we toss a coin repeatedly.
p82
aVThen the pattern, head-tail-tail, that we've suddenly become fixated with happens here.
p83
aVAnd you can count: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 \u2014
p84
aVit happens after the 10th toss.
p85
aVSo you might think there are more interesting things to do, but humor me for the moment.
p86
aVImagine this half of the audience each get out coins, and they toss them
p87
aVuntil they first see the pattern head-tail-tail.
p88
aVThe first time they do it, maybe it happens after the 10th toss, as here.
p89
aVThe second time, maybe it's after the fourth toss.
p90
aVThe next time, after the 15th toss.
p91
aVSo you do that lots and lots of times, and you average those numbers.
p92
aVThat's what I want this side to think about.
p93
aa(lp94
VThe other half of the audience doesn't like head-tail-tail \u2014
p95
aVthey think, for deep cultural reasons, that's boring \u2014
p96
aVand they're much more interested in a different pattern \u2014 head-tail-head.
p97
aVSo, on this side, you get out your coins, and you toss and toss and toss.
p98
aVAnd you count the number of times until the pattern head-tail-head appears
p99
aVand you average them. OK?
p100
aVSo on this side, you've got a number \u2014
p101
aVyou've done it lots of times, so you get it accurately \u2014
p102
aVwhich is the average number of tosses until head-tail-tail.
p103
aVOn this side, you've got a number \u2014 the average number of tosses until head-tail-head.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo here's a deep mathematical fact \u2014
p106
aVif you've got two numbers, one of three things must be true.
p107
aVEither they're the same, or this one's bigger than this one,
p108
aVor this one's bigger than that one.
p109
aVSo what's going on here?
p110
aVSo you've all got to think about this, and you've all got to vote \u2014
p111
aVand we're not moving on.
p112
aVAnd I don't want to end up in the two-minute silence
p113
aVto give you more time to think about it, until everyone's expressed a view. OK.
p114
aVSo what you want to do is compare the average number of tosses until we first see
p115
aVhead-tail-head with the average number of tosses until we first see head-tail-tail.
p116
aa(lp117
VWho thinks that A is true \u2014
p118
aVthat, on average, it'll take longer to see head-tail-head than head-tail-tail?
p119
aVWho thinks that B is true \u2014 that on average, they're the same?
p120
aVWho thinks that C is true \u2014 that, on average, it'll take less time
p121
aVto see head-tail-head than head-tail-tail?
p122
aVOK, who hasn't voted yet? Because that's really naughty \u2014 I said you had to.
p123
aV(Laughter)
p124
aVOK. So most people think B is true.
p125
aVAnd you might be relieved to know even rather distinguished mathematicians think that.
p126
aVIt's not. A is true here.
p127
aVIt takes longer, on average.
p128
aVIn fact, the average number of tosses till head-tail-head is 10
p129
aVand the average number of tosses until head-tail-tail is eight.
p130
aVHow could that be?
p131
aVAnything different about the two patterns?
p132
aVThere is. Head-tail-head overlaps itself.
p133
aVIf you went head-tail-head-tail-head, you can cunningly get two occurrences
p134
aVof the pattern in only five tosses.
p135
aVYou can't do that with head-tail-tail.
p136
aVThat turns out to be important.
p137
aa(lp138
VThere are two ways of thinking about this.
p139
aVI'll give you one of them.
p140
aVSo imagine \u2014 let's suppose we're doing it.
p141
aVOn this side \u2014 remember, you're excited about head-tail-tail;
p142
aVyou're excited about head-tail-head.
p143
aVWe start tossing a coin, and we get a head \u2014
p144
aVand you start sitting on the edge of your seat
p145
aVbecause something great and wonderful, or awesome, might be about to happen.
p146
aVThe next toss is a tail \u2014 you get really excited.
p147
aVThe champagne's on ice just next to you; you've got the glasses chilled to celebrate.
p148
aVYou're waiting with bated breath for the final toss.
p149
aVAnd if it comes down a head, that's great.
p150
aVYou're done, and you celebrate.
p151
aVIf it's a tail \u2014 well, rather disappointedly, you put the glasses away
p152
aVand put the champagne back.
p153
aVAnd you keep tossing, to wait for the next head, to get excited.
p154
aa(lp155
VOn this side, there's a different experience.
p156
aVIt's the same for the first two parts of the sequence.
p157
aVYou're a little bit excited with the first head \u2014
p158
aVyou get rather more excited with the next tail.
p159
aVThen you toss the coin.
p160
aVIf it's a tail, you crack open the champagne.
p161
aVIf it's a head you're disappointed,
p162
aVbut you're still a third of the way to your pattern again.
p163
aVAnd that's an informal way of presenting it \u2014 that's why there's a difference.
p164
aVAnother way of thinking about it \u2014
p165
aVif we tossed a coin eight million times,
p166
aVthen we'd expect a million head-tail-heads
p167
aVand a million head-tail-tails \u2014 but the head-tail-heads could occur in clumps.
p168
aVSo if you want to put a million things down amongst eight million positions
p169
aVand you can have some of them overlapping, the clumps will be further apart.
p170
aVIt's another way of getting the intuition.
p171
aa(lp172
VWhat's the point I want to make?
p173
aVIt's a very, very simple example, an easily stated question in probability,
p174
aVwhich every \u2014 you're in good company \u2014 everybody gets wrong.
p175
aVThis is my little diversion into my real passion, which is genetics.
p176
aVThere's a connection between head-tail-heads and head-tail-tails in genetics,
p177
aVand it's the following.
p178
aVWhen you toss a coin, you get a sequence of heads and tails.
p179
aVWhen you look at DNA, there's a sequence of not two things \u2014 heads and tails \u2014
p180
aVbut four letters \u2014 As, Gs, Cs and Ts.
p181
aVAnd there are little chemical scissors, called restriction enzymes
p182
aVwhich cut DNA whenever they see particular patterns.
p183
aVAnd they're an enormously useful tool in modern molecular biology.
p184
aVAnd instead of asking the question, "How long until I see a head-tail-head?" \u2014
p185
aVyou can ask, "How big will the chunks be when I use a restriction enzyme
p186
aVwhich cuts whenever it sees G-A-A-G, for example?
p187
aVHow long will those chunks be?"
p188
aa(lp189
VThat's a rather trivial connection between probability and genetics.
p190
aVThere's a much deeper connection, which I don't have time to go into
p191
aVand that is that modern genetics is a really exciting area of science.
p192
aVAnd we'll hear some talks later in the conference specifically about that.
p193
aVBut it turns out that unlocking the secrets in the information generated by modern
p194
aVexperimental technologies, a key part of that has to do with fairly sophisticated \u2014
p195
aVyou'll be relieved to know that I do something useful in my day job,
p196
aVrather more sophisticated than the head-tail-head story \u2014
p197
aVbut quite sophisticated computer modelings and mathematical modelings
p198
aVand modern statistical techniques.
p199
aVAnd I will give you two little snippets \u2014 two examples \u2014
p200
aVof projects we're involved in in my group in Oxford,
p201
aVboth of which I think are rather exciting.
p202
aVYou know about the Human Genome Project.
p203
aVThat was a project which aimed to read one copy of the human genome.
p204
aVThe natural thing to do after you've done that \u2014
p205
aVand that's what this project, the International HapMap Project,
p206
aVwhich is a collaboration between labs in five or six different countries.
p207
aVThink of the Human Genome Project as learning what we've got in common,
p208
aVand the HapMap Project is trying to understand
p209
aVwhere there are differences between different people.
p210
aa(lp211
VWhy do we care about that?
p212
aVWell, there are lots of reasons.
p213
aVThe most pressing one is that we want to understand how some differences
p214
aVmake some people susceptible to one disease \u2014 type-2 diabetes, for example \u2014
p215
aVand other differences make people more susceptible to heart disease,
p216
aVor stroke, or autism and so on.
p217
aVThat's one big project.
p218
aVThere's a second big project,
p219
aVrecently funded by the Wellcome Trust in this country,
p220
aVinvolving very large studies \u2014
p221
aVthousands of individuals, with each of eight different diseases,
p222
aVcommon diseases like type-1 and type-2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease,
p223
aVbipolar disease and so on \u2014 to try and understand the genetics.
p224
aVTo try and understand what it is about genetic differences that causes the diseases.
p225
aVWhy do we want to do that?
p226
aVBecause we understand very little about most human diseases.
p227
aVWe don't know what causes them.
p228
aVAnd if we can get in at the bottom and understand the genetics,
p229
aVwe'll have a window on the way the disease works,
p230
aVand a whole new way about thinking about disease therapies
p231
aVand preventative treatment and so on.
p232
aVSo that's, as I said, the little diversion on my main love.
p233
aa(lp234
VBack to some of the more mundane issues of thinking about uncertainty.
p235
aVHere's another quiz for you \u2014
p236
aVnow suppose we've got a test for a disease
p237
aVwhich isn't infallible, but it's pretty good.
p238
aVIt gets it right 99 percent of the time.
p239
aVAnd I take one of you, or I take someone off the street,
p240
aVand I test them for the disease in question.
p241
aVLet's suppose there's a test for HIV \u2014 the virus that causes AIDS \u2014
p242
aVand the test says the person has the disease.
p243
aVWhat's the chance that they do?
p244
aVThe test gets it right 99 percent of the time.
p245
aVSo a natural answer is 99 percent.
p246
aVWho likes that answer?
p247
aVCome on \u2014 everyone's got to get involved.
p248
aVDon't think you don't trust me anymore.
p249
aV(Laughter)
p250
aVWell, you're right to be a bit skeptical, because that's not the answer.
p251
aVThat's what you might think.
p252
aVIt's not the answer, and it's not because it's only part of the story.
p253
aVIt actually depends on how common or how rare the disease is.
p254
aVSo let me try and illustrate that.
p255
aVHere's a little caricature of a million individuals.
p256
aVSo let's think about a disease that affects \u2014
p257
aVit's pretty rare, it affects one person in 10,000.
p258
aVAmongst these million individuals, most of them are healthy
p259
aVand some of them will have the disease.
p260
aVAnd in fact, if this is the prevalence of the disease,
p261
aVabout 100 will have the disease and the rest won't.
p262
aVSo now suppose we test them all.
p263
aVWhat happens?
p264
aVWell, amongst the 100 who do have the disease,
p265
aVthe test will get it right 99 percent of the time, and 99 will test positive.
p266
aVAmongst all these other people who don't have the disease,
p267
aVthe test will get it right 99 percent of the time.
p268
aVIt'll only get it wrong one percent of the time.
p269
aVBut there are so many of them that there'll be an enormous number of false positives.
p270
aVPut that another way \u2014
p271
aVof all of them who test positive \u2014 so here they are, the individuals involved \u2014
p272
aVless than one in 100 actually have the disease.
p273
aVSo even though we think the test is accurate, the important part of the story is
p274
aVthere's another bit of information we need.
p275
aa(lp276
VHere's the key intuition.
p277
aVWhat we have to do, once we know the test is positive,
p278
aVis to weigh up the plausibility, or the likelihood, of two competing explanations.
p279
aVEach of those explanations has a likely bit and an unlikely bit.
p280
aVOne explanation is that the person doesn't have the disease \u2014
p281
aVthat's overwhelmingly likely, if you pick someone at random \u2014
p282
aVbut the test gets it wrong, which is unlikely.
p283
aVThe other explanation is that the person does have the disease \u2014 that's unlikely \u2014
p284
aVbut the test gets it right, which is likely.
p285
aVAnd the number we end up with \u2014
p286
aVthat number which is a little bit less than one in 100 \u2014
p287
aVis to do with how likely one of those explanations is relative to the other.
p288
aVEach of them taken together is unlikely.
p289
aa(lp290
VHere's a more topical example of exactly the same thing.
p291
aVThose of you in Britain will know about what's become rather a celebrated case
p292
aVof a woman called Sally Clark, who had two babies who died suddenly.
p293
aVAnd initially, it was thought that they died of what's known informally as "cot death,"
p294
aVand more formally as "Sudden Infant Death Syndrome."
p295
aVFor various reasons, she was later charged with murder.
p296
aVAnd at the trial, her trial, a very distinguished pediatrician gave evidence
p297
aVthat the chance of two cot deaths, innocent deaths, in a family like hers \u2014
p298
aVwhich was professional and non-smoking \u2014 was one in 73 million.
p299
aVTo cut a long story short, she was convicted at the time.
p300
aVLater, and fairly recently, acquitted on appeal \u2014 in fact, on the second appeal.
p301
aVAnd just to set it in context, you can imagine how awful it is for someone
p302
aVto have lost one child, and then two, if they're innocent,
p303
aVto be convicted of murdering them.
p304
aVTo be put through the stress of the trial, convicted of murdering them \u2014
p305
aVand to spend time in a women's prison, where all the other prisoners
p306
aVthink you killed your children \u2014 is a really awful thing to happen to someone.
p307
aVAnd it happened in large part here because the expert got the statistics
p308
aVhorribly wrong, in two different ways.
p309
aa(lp310
VSo where did he get the one in 73 million number?
p311
aVHe looked at some research, which said the chance of one cot death in a family
p312
aVlike Sally Clark's is about one in 8,500.
p313
aVSo he said, "I'll assume that if you have one cot death in a family,
p314
aVthe chance of a second child dying from cot death aren't changed."
p315
aVSo that's what statisticians would call an assumption of independence.
p316
aVIt's like saying, "If you toss a coin and get a head the first time,
p317
aVthat won't affect the chance of getting a head the second time."
p318
aVSo if you toss a coin twice, the chance of getting a head twice are a half \u2014
p319
aVthat's the chance the first time \u2014 times a half \u2014 the chance a second time.
p320
aVSo he said, "Here,
p321
aVI'll assume that these events are independent.
p322
aVWhen you multiply 8,500 together twice,
p323
aVyou get about 73 million."
p324
aVAnd none of this was stated to the court as an assumption
p325
aVor presented to the jury that way.
p326
aVUnfortunately here \u2014 and, really, regrettably \u2014
p327
aVfirst of all, in a situation like this you'd have to verify it empirically.
p328
aVAnd secondly, it's palpably false.
p329
aVThere are lots and lots of things that we don't know about sudden infant deaths.
p330
aVIt might well be that there are environmental factors that we're not aware of,
p331
aVand it's pretty likely to be the case that there are
p332
aVgenetic factors we're not aware of.
p333
aVSo if a family suffers from one cot death, you'd put them in a high-risk group.
p334
aVThey've probably got these environmental risk factors
p335
aVand/or genetic risk factors we don't know about.
p336
aVAnd to argue, then, that the chance of a second death is as if you didn't know
p337
aVthat information is really silly.
p338
aVIt's worse than silly \u2014 it's really bad science.
p339
aVNonetheless, that's how it was presented, and at trial nobody even argued it.
p340
aVThat's the first problem.
p341
aVThe second problem is, what does the number of one in 73 million mean?
p342
aVSo after Sally Clark was convicted \u2014
p343
aVyou can imagine, it made rather a splash in the press \u2014
p344
aVone of the journalists from one of Britain's more reputable newspapers wrote that
p345
aVwhat the expert had said was,
p346
aV"The chance that she was innocent was one in 73 million."
p347
aVNow, that's a logical error.
p348
aVIt's exactly the same logical error as the logical error of thinking that
p349
aVafter the disease test, which is 99 percent accurate,
p350
aVthe chance of having the disease is 99 percent.
p351
aVIn the disease example, we had to bear in mind two things,
p352
aVone of which was the possibility that the test got it right or not.
p353
aVAnd the other one was the chance, a priori, that the person had the disease or not.
p354
aVIt's exactly the same in this context.
p355
aVThere are two things involved \u2014 two parts to the explanation.
p356
aVWe want to know how likely, or relatively how likely, two different explanations are.
p357
aVOne of them is that Sally Clark was innocent \u2014
p358
aVwhich is, a priori, overwhelmingly likely \u2014
p359
aVmost mothers don't kill their children.
p360
aVAnd the second part of the explanation
p361
aVis that she suffered an incredibly unlikely event.
p362
aVNot as unlikely as one in 73 million, but nonetheless rather unlikely.
p363
aVThe other explanation is that she was guilty.
p364
aVNow, we probably think a priori that's unlikely.
p365
aVAnd we certainly should think in the context of a criminal trial
p366
aVthat that's unlikely, because of the presumption of innocence.
p367
aVAnd then if she were trying to kill the children, she succeeded.
p368
aVSo the chance that she's innocent isn't one in 73 million.
p369
aVWe don't know what it is.
p370
aVIt has to do with weighing up the strength of the other evidence against her
p371
aVand the statistical evidence.
p372
aVWe know the children died.
p373
aVWhat matters is how likely or unlikely, relative to each other,
p374
aVthe two explanations are.
p375
aVAnd they're both implausible.
p376
aVThere's a situation where errors in statistics had really profound
p377
aVand really unfortunate consequences.
p378
aVIn fact, there are two other women who were convicted on the basis of the
p379
aVevidence of this pediatrician, who have subsequently been released on appeal.
p380
aVMany cases were reviewed.
p381
aVAnd it's particularly topical because he's currently facing a disrepute charge
p382
aVat Britain's General Medical Council.
p383
aa(lp384
VSo just to conclude \u2014 what are the take-home messages from this?
p385
aVWell, we know that randomness and uncertainty and chance
p386
aVare very much a part of our everyday life.
p387
aVIt's also true \u2014 and, although, you, as a collective, are very special in many ways,
p388
aVyou're completely typical in not getting the examples I gave right.
p389
aVIt's very well documented that people get things wrong.
p390
aVThey make errors of logic in reasoning with uncertainty.
p391
aVWe can cope with the subtleties of language brilliantly \u2014
p392
aVand there are interesting evolutionary questions about how we got here.
p393
aVWe are not good at reasoning with uncertainty.
p394
aVThat's an issue in our everyday lives.
p395
aVAs you've heard from many of the talks, statistics underpins an enormous amount
p396
aVof research in science \u2014 in social science, in medicine
p397
aVand indeed, quite a lot of industry.
p398
aVAll of quality control, which has had a major impact on industrial processing,
p399
aVis underpinned by statistics.
p400
aVIt's something we're bad at doing.
p401
aVAt the very least, we should recognize that, and we tend not to.
p402
aVTo go back to the legal context, at the Sally Clark trial
p403
aVall of the lawyers just accepted what the expert said.
p404
aVSo if a pediatrician had come out and said to a jury,
p405
aV"I know how to build bridges. I've built one down the road.
p406
aVPlease drive your car home over it,"
p407
aVthey would have said, "Well, pediatricians don't know how to build bridges.
p408
aVThat's what engineers do."
p409
aVOn the other hand, he came out and effectively said, or implied,
p410
aV"I know how to reason with uncertainty. I know how to do statistics."
p411
aVAnd everyone said, "Well, that's fine. He's an expert."
p412
aVSo we need to understand where our competence is and isn't.
p413
aVExactly the same kinds of issues arose in the early days of DNA profiling,
p414
aVwhen scientists, and lawyers and in some cases judges,
p415
aVroutinely misrepresented evidence.
p416
aVUsually \u2014 one hopes \u2014 innocently, but misrepresented evidence.
p417
aVForensic scientists said, "The chance that this guy's innocent is one in three million."
p418
aVEven if you believe the number, just like the 73 million to one,
p419
aVthat's not what it meant.
p420
aVAnd there have been celebrated appeal cases
p421
aVin Britain and elsewhere because of that.
p422
aa(lp423
VAnd just to finish in the context of the legal system.
p424
aVIt's all very well to say, "Let's do our best to present the evidence."
p425
aVBut more and more, in cases of DNA profiling \u2014 this is another one \u2014
p426
aVwe expect juries, who are ordinary people \u2014
p427
aVand it's documented they're very bad at this \u2014
p428
aVwe expect juries to be able to cope with the sorts of reasoning that goes on.
p429
aVIn other spheres of life, if people argued \u2014 well, except possibly for politics \u2014
p430
aVbut in other spheres of life, if people argued illogically,
p431
aVwe'd say that's not a good thing.
p432
aVWe sort of expect it of politicians and don't hope for much more.
p433
aVIn the case of uncertainty, we get it wrong all the time \u2014
p434
aVand at the very least, we should be aware of that,
p435
aVand ideally, we might try and do something about it.
p436
aVThanks very much.

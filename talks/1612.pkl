VLet me tell you, it has been a fantastic month for deception.
p5
aVAnd I'm not even talking about the American presidential race. (Laughter)
p6
aVWe have a high-profile journalist caught for plagiarism,
p7
aVa young superstar writer whose book involves
p8
aVso many made up quotes that they've pulled it from the shelves;
p9
aVa New York Times exposé on fake book reviews.
p10
aVIt's been fantastic.
p11
aa(lp12
VNow, of course, not all deception hits the news.
p13
aVMuch of the deception is everyday. In fact, a lot of research
p14
aVshows that we all lie once or twice a day, as Dave suggested.
p15
aVSo it's about 6:30 now, suggests that most of us should have lied.
p16
aVLet's take a look at Winnipeg. How many of you,
p17
aVin the last 24 hours \u2014 think back \u2014 have told a little fib,
p18
aVor a big one? How many have told a little lie out there?
p19
aa(lp20
VAll right, good. These are all the liars.
p21
aVMake sure you pay attention to them. (Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VNo, that looked good, it was about two thirds of you.
p24
aVThe other third didn't lie, or perhaps forgot,
p25
aVor you're lying to me about your lying, which is very,
p26
aVvery devious. (Laughter) This fits with a lot of the research,
p27
aVwhich suggests that lying is very pervasive.
p28
aVIt's this pervasiveness, combined with the centrality
p29
aVto what it means to be a human, the fact that we can
p30
aVtell the truth or make something up,
p31
aVthat has fascinated people throughout history.
p32
aVHere we have Diogenes with his lantern.
p33
aVDoes anybody know what he was looking for?
p34
aVA single honest man, and he died without finding one
p35
aVback in Greece. And we have Confucius in the East
p36
aVwho was really concerned with sincerity,
p37
aVnot only that you walked the walk or talked the talk,
p38
aVbut that you believed in what you were doing.
p39
aVYou believed in your principles.
p40
aa(lp41
VNow my first professional encounter with deception
p42
aVis a little bit later than these guys, a couple thousand years.
p43
aVI was a customs officer for Canada back in the mid-'90s.
p44
aVYeah. I was defending Canada's borders.
p45
aVYou may think that's a weapon right there. In fact,
p46
aVthat's a stamp. I used a stamp to defend Canada's borders. (Laughter)
p47
aVVery Canadian of me. I learned a lot about deception
p48
aVwhile doing my duty here in customs,
p49
aVone of which was that most of what I thought I knew about deception was wrong,
p50
aVand I'll tell you about some of that tonight.
p51
aa(lp52
VBut even since just 1995, '96, the way we communicate
p53
aVhas been completely transformed. We email, we text,
p54
aVwe skype, we Facebook. It's insane.
p55
aVAlmost every aspect of human communication's been changed,
p56
aVand of course that's had an impact on deception.
p57
aVLet me tell you a little bit about a couple of new deceptions
p58
aVwe've been tracking and documenting.
p59
aVThey're called the Butler, the Sock Puppet
p60
aVand the Chinese Water Army.
p61
aVIt sounds a little bit like a weird book,
p62
aVbut actually they're all new types of lies.
p63
aa(lp64
VLet's start with the Butlers. Here's an example of one:
p65
aV"On my way." Anybody ever written, "On my way?"
p66
aVThen you've also lied. (Laughter)
p67
aVWe're never on our way. We're thinking about going on our way.
p68
aVHere's another one: "Sorry I didn't respond to you earlier.
p69
aVMy battery was dead." Your battery wasn't dead.
p70
aVYou weren't in a dead zone.
p71
aVYou just didn't want to respond to that person that time.
p72
aVHere's the last one: You're talking to somebody,
p73
aVand you say, "Sorry, got work, gotta go."
p74
aVBut really, you're just bored. You want to talk to somebody else.
p75
aVEach of these is about a relationship,
p76
aVand this is a 24/7 connected world. Once you get my cell phone number,
p77
aVyou can literally be in touch with me 24 hours a day.
p78
aVAnd so these lies are being used by people
p79
aVto create a buffer, like the butler used to do,
p80
aVbetween us and the connections to everybody else.
p81
aVBut they're very special. They use ambiguity
p82
aVthat comes from using technology. You don't know
p83
aVwhere I am or what I'm doing or who I'm with.
p84
aVAnd they're aimed at protecting the relationships.
p85
aVThese aren't just people being jerks. These are people
p86
aVthat are saying, look, I don't want to talk to you now,
p87
aVor I didn't want to talk to you then, but I still care about you.
p88
aVOur relationship is still important.
p89
aa(lp90
VNow, the Sock Puppet, on the other hand,
p91
aVis a totally different animal. The sock puppet isn't
p92
aVabout ambiguity, per se. It's about identity.
p93
aVLet me give you a very recent example,
p94
aVas in, like, last week.
p95
aVHere's R.J. Ellory, best-seller author in Britain.
p96
aVHere's one of his bestselling books.
p97
aVHere's a reviewer online, on Amazon.
p98
aVMy favorite, by Nicodemus Jones, is,
p99
aV"Whatever else it might do, it will touch your soul."
p100
aVAnd of course, you might suspect
p101
aVthat Nicodemus Jones is R.J. Ellory.
p102
aVHe wrote very, very positive reviews about himself. Surprise, surprise.
p103
aa(lp104
VNow this Sock Puppet stuff isn't actually that new.
p105
aVWalt Whitman also did this back in the day,
p106
aVbefore there was Internet technology. Sock Puppet
p107
aVbecomes interesting when we get to scale,
p108
aVwhich is the domain of the Chinese Water Army.
p109
aVChinese Water Army refers to thousands of people
p110
aVin China that are paid small amounts of money
p111
aVto produce content. It could be reviews. It could be
p112
aVpropaganda. The government hires these people,
p113
aVcompanies hire them, all over the place.
p114
aVIn North America, we call this Astroturfing,
p115
aVand Astroturfing is very common now. There's a lot of concerns about it.
p116
aVWe see this especially with product reviews, book reviews,
p117
aVeverything from hotels to whether that toaster is a good toaster or not.
p118
aa(lp119
VNow, looking at these three reviews, or these three types of deception,
p120
aVyou might think, wow, the Internet is really making us
p121
aVa deceptive species, especially when you think about
p122
aVthe Astroturfing, where we can see deception brought up to scale.
p123
aVBut actually, what I've been finding is very different from that.
p124
aVNow, let's put aside the online anonymous sex chatrooms,
p125
aVwhich I'm sure none of you have been in.
p126
aVI can assure you there's deception there.
p127
aVAnd let's put aside the Nigerian prince who's emailed you
p128
aVabout getting the 43 million out of the country. (Laughter)
p129
aVLet's forget about that guy, too.
p130
aVLet's focus on the conversations between our friends
p131
aVand our family and our coworkers and our loved ones.
p132
aVThose are the conversations that really matter.
p133
aVWhat does technology do to deception with those folks?
p134
aa(lp135
VHere's a couple of studies. One of the studies we do
p136
aVare called diary studies, in which we ask people to record
p137
aVall of their conversations and all of their lies for seven days,
p138
aVand what we can do then is calculate how many lies took place
p139
aVper conversation within a medium, and the finding
p140
aVthat we get that surprises people the most is that email
p141
aVis the most honest of those three media.
p142
aVAnd it really throws people for a loop because we think,
p143
aVwell, there's no nonverbal cues, so why don't you lie more?
p144
aVThe phone, in contrast, the most lies.
p145
aVAgain and again and again we see the phone is the device
p146
aVthat people lie on the most, and perhaps because of the Butler Lie ambiguities I was telling you about.
p147
aVThis tends to be very different from what people expect.
p148
aa(lp149
VWhat about résumés? We did a study in which we had
p150
aVpeople apply for a job, and they could apply for a job
p151
aVeither with a traditional paper résumé, or on LinkedIn,
p152
aVwhich is a social networking site like Facebook,
p153
aVbut for professionals \u2014 involves the same information as a résumé.
p154
aVAnd what we found, to many people's surprise,
p155
aVwas that those LinkedIn résumés were more honest
p156
aVon the things that mattered to employers, like your
p157
aVresponsibilities or your skills at your previous job.
p158
aa(lp159
VHow about Facebook itself?
p160
aVYou know, we always think that hey, there are these
p161
aVidealized versions, people are just showing the best things
p162
aVthat happened in their lives. I've thought that many times.
p163
aVMy friends, no way they can be that cool and have good of a life.
p164
aVWell, one study tested this by examining people's personalities.
p165
aVThey had four good friends of a person judge their personality.
p166
aVThen they had strangers, many strangers,
p167
aVjudge the person's personality just from Facebook,
p168
aVand what they found was those judgments of the personality
p169
aVwere pretty much identical, highly correlated,
p170
aVmeaning that Facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality.
p171
aa(lp172
VAll right, well, what about online dating?
p173
aVI mean, that's a pretty deceptive space.
p174
aVI'm sure you all have "friends" that have used online dating. (Laughter)
p175
aVAnd they would tell you about that guy that had no hair
p176
aVwhen he came, or the woman that didn't look at all like her photo.
p177
aVWell, we were really interested in it, and so what we did
p178
aVis we brought people, online daters, into the lab,
p179
aVand then we measured them. We got their height
p180
aVup against the wall, we put them on a scale, got their weight \u2014
p181
aVladies loved that \u2014 and then we actually got their driver's license to get their age.
p182
aVAnd what we found was very, very interesting.
p183
aVHere's an example of the men and the height.
p184
aVAlong the bottom is how tall they said they were in their profile.
p185
aVAlong the y-axis, the vertical axis, is how tall they actually were.
p186
aVThat diagonal line is the truth line. If their dot's on it,
p187
aVthey were telling exactly the truth.
p188
aVNow, as you see, most of the little dots are below the line.
p189
aVWhat it means is all the guys were lying about their height.
p190
aVIn fact, they lied about their height about nine tenths of an inch,
p191
aVwhat we say in the lab as "strong rounding up." (Laughter)
p192
aVYou get to 5'8" and one tenth, and boom! 5'9".
p193
aVBut what's really important here is, look at all those dots.
p194
aVThey are clustering pretty close to the truth. What we found
p195
aVwas 80 percent of our participants did indeed lie
p196
aVon one of those dimensions, but they always lied by a little bit.
p197
aVOne of the reasons is pretty simple. If you go to a date,
p198
aVa coffee date, and you're completely different than what you said,
p199
aVgame over. Right? So people lied frequently, but they lied
p200
aVsubtly, not too much. They were constrained.
p201
aa(lp202
VWell, what explains all these studies? What explains the fact
p203
aVthat despite our intuitions, mine included,
p204
aVa lot of online communication, technologically-mediated
p205
aVcommunication, is more honest than face to face?
p206
aVThat really is strange. How do we explain this?
p207
aa(lp208
VWell, to do that, one thing is we can look at the deception-detection literature.
p209
aVIt's a very old literature by now, it's coming up on 50 years.
p210
aVIt's been reviewed many times. There's been thousands of trials,
p211
aVhundreds of studies, and there's some really compelling findings.
p212
aa(lp213
VThe first is, we're really bad at detecting deception,
p214
aVreally bad. Fifty-four percent accuracy on average when you have to tell
p215
aVif somebody that just said a statement is lying or not.
p216
aVThat's really bad. Why is it so bad?
p217
aVWell it has to do with Pinocchio's nose.
p218
aVIf I were to ask you guys, what do you rely on
p219
aVwhen you're looking at somebody and you want to find out
p220
aVif they're lying? What cue do you pay attention to?
p221
aVMost of you would say that one of the cues you look at
p222
aVis the eyes. The eyes are the window to the soul.
p223
aVAnd you're not alone. Around the world, almost every culture,
p224
aVone of the top cues is eyes. But the research
p225
aVover the last 50 years says there's actually no reliable cue
p226
aVto deception, which blew me away, and it's one of
p227
aVthe hard lessons that I learned when I was customs officer.
p228
aVThe eyes do not tell us whether somebody's lying or not.
p229
aVSome situations, yes \u2014 high stakes, maybe their pupils dilate,
p230
aVtheir pitch goes up, their body movements change a little bit,
p231
aVbut not all the time, not for everybody, it's not reliable.
p232
aVStrange. The other thing is that just because you can't see me
p233
aVdoesn't mean I'm going to lie. It's common sense,
p234
aVbut one important finding is that we lie for a reason.
p235
aVWe lie to protect ourselves or for our own gain
p236
aVor for somebody else's gain.
p237
aVSo there are some pathological liars, but they make up
p238
aVa tiny portion of the population. We lie for a reason.
p239
aVJust because people can't see us doesn't mean
p240
aVwe're going to necessarily lie.
p241
aa(lp242
VBut I think there's actually something much more
p243
aVinteresting and fundamental going on here. The next big
p244
aVthing for me, the next big idea, we can find by going
p245
aVway back in history to the origins of language.
p246
aVMost linguists agree that we started speaking somewhere
p247
aVbetween 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. That's a long time ago.
p248
aVA lot of humans have lived since then.
p249
aVWe've been talking, I guess, about fires and caves
p250
aVand saber-toothed tigers. I don't know what they talked about,
p251
aVbut they were doing a lot of talking, and like I said,
p252
aVthere's a lot of humans evolving speaking,
p253
aVabout 100 billion people in fact.
p254
aVWhat's important though is that writing only emerged
p255
aVabout 5,000 years ago. So what that means is that
p256
aVall the people before there was any writing,
p257
aVevery word that they ever said, every utterance
p258
aVdisappeared. No trace. Evanescent. Gone.
p259
aVSo we've been evolving to talk in a way in which
p260
aVthere is no record. In fact, even the next big change
p261
aVto writing was only 500 years ago now,
p262
aVwith the printing press, which is very recent in our past,
p263
aVand literacy rates remained incredibly low right up until World War II,
p264
aVso even the people of the last two millennia,
p265
aVmost of the words they ever said \u2014 poof! \u2014 disappeared.
p266
aa(lp267
VLet's turn to now, the networked age.
p268
aVHow many of you have recorded something today?
p269
aVAnybody do any writing today? Did anybody write a word?
p270
aVIt looks like almost every single person here recorded something.
p271
aVIn this room, right now, we've probably recorded more
p272
aVthan almost all of human pre-ancient history.
p273
aVThat is crazy. We're entering this amazing period
p274
aVof flux in human evolution where we've evolved to speak
p275
aVin a way in which our words disappear, but we're in
p276
aVan environment where we're recording everything.
p277
aVIn fact, I think in the very near future, it's not just
p278
aVwhat we write that will be recorded, everything we do
p279
aVwill be recorded.
p280
aVWhat does that mean? What's the next big idea from that?
p281
aVWell, as a social scientist, this is the most amazing thing
p282
aVI have ever even dreamed of. Now, I can look at
p283
aVall those words that used to, for millennia, disappear.
p284
aVI can look at lies that before were said and then gone.
p285
aVYou remember those Astroturfing reviews that we were
p286
aVtalking about before? Well, when they write a fake review,
p287
aVthey have to post it somewhere, and it's left behind for us.
p288
aa(lp289
VSo one thing that we did, and I'll give you an example of
p290
aVlooking at the language, is we paid people
p291
aVto write some fake reviews. One of these reviews is fake.
p292
aVThe person never was at the James Hotel.
p293
aVThe other review is real. The person stayed there.
p294
aVNow, your task now is to decide
p295
aVwhich review is fake?
p296
aVI'll give you a moment to read through them.
p297
aVBut I want everybody to raise their hand at some point.
p298
aVRemember, I study deception. I can tell if you don't raise your hand.
p299
aVAll right, how many of you believe that A is the fake?
p300
aVAll right. Very good. About half.
p301
aVAnd how many of you think that B is?
p302
aVAll right. Slightly more for B.
p303
aVExcellent. Here's the answer.
p304
aVB is a fake. Well done second group. You dominated the first group. (Laughter)
p305
aVYou're actually a little bit unusual. Every time we demonstrate this,
p306
aVit's usually about a 50-50 split, which fits
p307
aVwith the research, 54 percent. Maybe people here
p308
aVin Winnipeg are more suspicious and better at figuring it out.
p309
aVThose cold, hard winters, I love it.
p310
aa(lp311
VAll right, so why do I care about this?
p312
aVWell, what I can do now with my colleagues in computer science
p313
aVis we can create computer algorithms that can analyze
p314
aVthe linguistic traces of deception.
p315
aVLet me highlight a couple of things here
p316
aVin the fake review. The first is that liars tend to think
p317
aVabout narrative. They make up a story:
p318
aVWho? And what happened? And that's what happened here.
p319
aVOur fake reviewers talked about who they were with
p320
aVand what they were doing. They also used the first person singular, I,
p321
aVway more than the people that actually stayed there.
p322
aVThey were inserting themselves into the hotel review,
p323
aVkind of trying to convince you they were there.
p324
aVIn contrast, the people that wrote the reviews that were actually there,
p325
aVtheir bodies actually entered the physical space,
p326
aVthey talked a lot more about spatial information.
p327
aVThey said how big the bathroom was, or they said,
p328
aVyou know, here's how far shopping is from the hotel.
p329
aa(lp330
VNow, you guys did pretty well. Most people perform at chance at this task.
p331
aVOur computer algorithm is very accurate, much more accurate
p332
aVthan humans can be, and it's not going to be accurate all the time.
p333
aVThis isn't a deception-detection machine to tell
p334
aVif your girlfriend's lying to you on text messaging.
p335
aVWe believe that every lie now, every type of lie \u2014
p336
aVfake hotel reviews, fake shoe reviews,
p337
aVyour girlfriend cheating on you with text messaging \u2014
p338
aVthose are all different lies. They're going to have
p339
aVdifferent patterns of language. But because everything's
p340
aVrecorded now, we can look at all of those kinds of lies.
p341
aa(lp342
VNow, as I said, as a social scientist, this is wonderful.
p343
aVIt's transformational. We're going to be able to learn
p344
aVso much more about human thought and expression,
p345
aVabout everything from love to attitudes,
p346
aVbecause everything is being recorded now, but
p347
aVwhat does it mean for the average citizen?
p348
aVWhat does it mean for us in our lives?
p349
aVWell, let's forget deception for a bit. One of the big ideas,
p350
aVI believe, is that we're leaving these huge traces behind.
p351
aVMy outbox for email is massive,
p352
aVand I never look at it. I write all the time,
p353
aVbut I never look at my record, at my trace.
p354
aVAnd I think we're going to see a lot more of that,
p355
aVwhere we can reflect on who we are by looking at
p356
aVwhat we wrote, what we said, what we did.
p357
aa(lp358
VNow, if we bring it back to deception, there's a couple
p359
aVof take-away things here.
p360
aVFirst, lying online can be very dangerous, right?
p361
aVNot only are you leaving a record for yourself on your machine,
p362
aVbut you're leaving a record on the person that you were lying to,
p363
aVand you're also leaving them around for me to analyze
p364
aVwith some computer algorithms.
p365
aVSo by all means, go ahead and do that, that's good.
p366
aVBut when it comes to lying and what we want to do
p367
aVwith our lives, I think we can go back to
p368
aVDiogenes and Confucius. And they were less concerned
p369
aVabout whether to lie or not to lie, and more concerned about
p370
aVbeing true to the self, and I think this is really important.
p371
aVNow, when you are about to say or do something,
p372
aVwe can think, do I want this to be part of my legacy,
p373
aVpart of my personal record?
p374
aVBecause in the digital age we live in now,
p375
aVin the networked age, we are all leaving a record.
p376
aVThank you so much for your time,
p377
aVand good luck with your record. (Applause)

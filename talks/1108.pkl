VAdrian Kohler: Well, we're here today
p5
aVto talk about the evolution of a puppet horse.
p6
aa(lp7
VBasil Jones: But actually we're going to start this evolution
p8
aVwith a hyena.
p9
aa(lp10
VAK: The ancestor of the horse.
p11
aVOkay, we'll do something with it.
p12
aV(Laughter)
p13
aVHahahaha.
p14
aVThe hyena is the ancestor of the horse
p15
aVbecause it was part of a production
p16
aVcalled "Faustus in Africa,"
p17
aVa Handspring Production from 1995,
p18
aVwhere it had to play draughts with Helen of Troy.
p19
aVThis production was directed
p20
aVby South African artist and theater director,
p21
aVWilliam Kentridge.
p22
aVSo it needed a very articulate front paw.
p23
aVBut, like all puppets, it has other attributes.
p24
aa(lp25
VBJ: One of them is breath,
p26
aVand it kind of breathes.
p27
aa(lp28
VAK: Haa haa haaa.
p29
aa(lp30
VBJ: Breath is really important for us.
p31
aVIt's the kind of original movement
p32
aVfor any puppet for us onstage.
p33
aVIt's the thing that distinguishes the puppet \u2014
p34
aa(lp35
VAK: Oops.
p36
aa(lp37
VBJ: From an actor.
p38
aVPuppets always have to try to be alive.
p39
aVIt's their kind of ur-story onstage,
p40
aVthat desperation to live.
p41
aa(lp42
VAK: Yeah, it's basically a dead object, as you can see,
p43
aVand it only lives
p44
aVbecause you make it.
p45
aVAn actor struggles to die onstage,
p46
aVbut a puppet has to struggle to live.
p47
aVAnd in a way that's a metaphor for life.
p48
aa(lp49
VBJ: So every moment it's on the stage, it's making the struggle.
p50
aVSo we call this
p51
aVa piece of emotional engineering
p52
aVthat uses up-to-the-minute
p53
aV17th century technology \u2014
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aVto turn nouns
p56
aVinto verbs.
p57
aa(lp58
VAK: Well actually I prefer to say
p59
aVthat it's an object
p60
aVconstructed out of wood and cloth
p61
aVwith movement built into it
p62
aVto persuade you to believe that it has life.
p63
aa(lp64
VBJ: Okay so.
p65
aa(lp66
VAK: It has ears that move passively
p67
aVwhen the head goes.
p68
aa(lp69
VBJ: And it has these bulkheads
p70
aVmade out of plywood,
p71
aVcovered with fabric \u2014
p72
aVcuriously similar, in fact,
p73
aVto the plywood canoes
p74
aVthat Adrian's father used to make
p75
aVwhen he was a boy in their workshop.
p76
aa(lp77
VAK: In Port Elizabeth, the village outside Port Elizabeth in South Africa.
p78
aa(lp79
VBJ: His mother was a puppeteer.
p80
aVAnd when we met at art school
p81
aVand fell in love
p82
aVin 1971,
p83
aVI hated puppets.
p84
aVI really thought they were so beneath me.
p85
aVI wanted to become an avant-garde artist \u2014
p86
aVand Punch and Judy was certainly not where I wanted to go.
p87
aVAnd, in fact, it took about 10 years
p88
aa(lp89
Vto discover
p90
aVthe Bambara Bamana puppets of Mali in West Africa,
p91
aVwhere there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry,
p92
aVto learn a renewed, or a new, respect
p93
aVfor this art form.
p94
aa(lp95
VAK: So in 1981, I persuaded Basil and some friends of mine
p96
aVto form a puppet company.
p97
aVAnd 20 years later, miraculously,
p98
aVwe collaborated with a company from Mali,
p99
aVthe Sogolon Marionette Troupe of Bamako,
p100
aVwhere we made a piece about a tall giraffe.
p101
aVIt was just called "Tall Horse," which was a life-sized giraffe.
p102
aa(lp103
VBJ: And here again, you see the same structure.
p104
aVThe bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane,
p105
aVbut it's ultimately the same structure.
p106
aVIt's got two people inside it on stilts,
p107
aVwhich give them the height,
p108
aVand somebody in the front
p109
aVwho's using a kind of steering wheel to move that head.
p110
aa(lp111
VAK: The person in the hind legs
p112
aVis also controlling the tail, a bit like the hyena \u2014
p113
aVsame mechanism, just a bit bigger.
p114
aVAnd he's controlling the ear movement.
p115
aa(lp116
VBJ: So this production
p117
aVwas seen by Tom Morris
p118
aVof the National Theatre in London.
p119
aVAnd just around that time,
p120
aVhis mother had said,
p121
aV"Have you seen this book by Michael Morpurgo
p122
aVcalled 'War Horse'?"
p123
aa(lp124
VAK: It's about a boy who falls in love with a horse.
p125
aVThe horse is sold to the First World War,
p126
aVand he joins up to find his horse.
p127
aa(lp128
VBJ: So Tom gave us a call and said,
p129
aV"Do you think you could make us a horse
p130
aVfor a show to happen at the National Theatre?"
p131
aa(lp132
VAK: It seemed a lovely idea.
p133
aa(lp134
VBJ: But it had to ride. It had to have a rider.
p135
aa(lp136
VAK: It had to have a rider,
p137
aVand it had to participate in cavalry charges.
p138
aV(Laughter)
p139
aVA play about early 20th century plowing technology
p140
aVand cavalry charges
p141
aVwas a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department
p142
aVat the National Theatre in London.
p143
aVBut they agreed to go along with it for a while.
p144
aVSo we began with a test.
p145
aa(lp146
VBJ: This is Adrian and Thys Stander,
p147
aVwho went on to actually design the cane system for the horse,
p148
aVand our next-door neighbor Katherine,
p149
aVriding on a ladder.
p150
aVThe weight is really difficult when it's up above your head.
p151
aa(lp152
VAK: And once we put Katherine
p153
aVthrough that particular brand of hell,
p154
aVwe knew that we might be able to make a horse, which could be ridden.
p155
aVSo we made a model.
p156
aVThis is a cardboard model,
p157
aVa little bit smaller than the hyena.
p158
aVYou'll notice that the legs are plywood legs
p159
aVand the canoe structure is still there.
p160
aa(lp161
VBJ: And the two manipulators are inside.
p162
aVBut we didn't realize at the time
p163
aVthat we actually needed a third manipulator,
p164
aVbecause we couldn't manipulate the neck
p165
aVfrom inside
p166
aVand walk the horse at the same time.
p167
aa(lp168
VAK: We started work on the prototype
p169
aVafter the model was approved,
p170
aVand the prototype took a bit longer
p171
aVthan we anticipated.
p172
aVWe had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones.
p173
aVAnd we had a crate built for it.
p174
aVIt had to be shipped to London.
p175
aVWe were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in Cape Town,
p176
aVand it got to midnight and we hadn't done that yet.
p177
aa(lp178
VBJ: So we got a camera,
p179
aVand we posed the puppet
p180
aVin various galloping stances.
p181
aVAnd we sent it off
p182
aVto the National Theatre,
p183
aVhoping that they believed
p184
aVthat we created something that worked.
p185
aV(Laughter)
p186
aa(lp187
VAK: A month later, we were there in London
p188
aVwith this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us.
p189
aa(lp190
VBJ: About 40 people.
p191
aa(lp192
VAK: We were terrified.
p193
aVWe opened the lid, we took the horse out,
p194
aVand it did work; it walked and it was able to be ridden.
p195
aVHere I have an 18-second clip
p196
aVof the very first walk of the prototype.
p197
aVThis is in the National Theatre studio,
p198
aVthe place where they cook new ideas.
p199
aVIt had by no means got the green light yet.
p200
aVThe choreographer, Toby Sedgwick,
p201
aVinvented a beautiful sequence
p202
aVwhere the baby horse,
p203
aVwhich was made out of sticks and bits of twigs,
p204
aVgrew up into the big horse.
p205
aVAnd Nick Starr, the director of the National Theatre,
p206
aVsaw that particular moment, he was standing next to me \u2014 he nearly wet himself.
p207
aVAnd so the show was given the green light.
p208
aVAnd we went back to Cape Town and redesigned the horse completely.
p209
aVHere is the plan.
p210
aa(lp211
V(Laughter)
p212
aa(lp213
VAnd here is our factory in Cape Town
p214
aVwhere we make horses.
p215
aVYou can see quite a lot of skeletons in the background there.
p216
aVThe horses are completely handmade.
p217
aVThere is very little 20th century technology in them.
p218
aVWe used a bit of laser cutting on the plywood
p219
aVand some of the aluminum pieces.
p220
aVBut because they have to be light and flexible,
p221
aVand each one of them is different,
p222
aVthey can't be mass-produced, unfortunately.
p223
aVSo here are some half-finished horses
p224
aVready to be worked in London.
p225
aVAnd now we would like to introduce you
p226
aVto Joey.
p227
aVJoey boy, you there?
p228
aVJoey.
p229
aV(Applause)
p230
aV(Applause)
p231
aVJoey.
p232
aVJoey, come here.
p233
aVNo, no, I haven't got it.
p234
aVHe's got it; it's in his pocket.
p235
aa(lp236
VBJ: Joey.
p237
aVAK: Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey.
p238
aVCome here. Stand here where people can see you.
p239
aVMove around. Come on.
p240
aVI'd just like to describe \u2014
p241
aVI won't talk too loud. He might get irritated.
p242
aVHere, Craig is working the head.
p243
aVHe has bicycle brake cables
p244
aVgoing down to the head control in his hand.
p245
aVEach one of them
p246
aVoperates either an ear, separately,
p247
aVor the head, up and down.
p248
aVBut he also controls the head directly
p249
aVby using his hand.
p250
aVThe ears are obviously
p251
aVa very important emotional indicator of the horse.
p252
aVWhen they point right back,
p253
aVthe horse is fearful or angry,
p254
aVdepending upon what's going on in front of him, around him.
p255
aVOr, when he's more relaxed, the head comes down
p256
aVand the ears listen, either side.
p257
aVHorses' hearing is very important.
p258
aVIt's almost more important than their eyesight.
p259
aVOver here,
p260
aVTommy's got what you call the heart position.
p261
aVHe's working the leg.
p262
aVYou see the string tendon from the hyena,
p263
aVthe hyena's front leg,
p264
aVautomatically pulls the hoop up.
p265
aV(Laughter)
p266
aVHorses are so unpredictable.
p267
aV(Laughter)
p268
aVThe way a hoof comes up with a horse
p269
aVimmediately gives you the feeling
p270
aVthat it's a convincing horse action.
p271
aVThe hind legs have got the same action.
p272
aa(lp273
VBJ: And Mikey also has,
p274
aVin his fingers,
p275
aVthe ability to move the tail
p276
aVfrom left to right,
p277
aVand up and down with the other hand.
p278
aVAnd together, there's quite a complex possibility
p279
aVof tail expression.
p280
aa(lp281
VAK: You want to say something about the breathing?
p282
aa(lp283
VBJ: We had a big challenge with breathing.
p284
aVAdrian thought
p285
aVthat he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two
p286
aVand make it breathe like that \u2014
p287
aVbecause that's how a horse would breathe, with an expanded chest.
p288
aVBut we realized
p289
aVthat, if that were to be happening,
p290
aVyou wouldn't, as an audience, see the breath.
p291
aVSo he made a channel in here,
p292
aVand the chest moves up and down in that channel.
p293
aVSo it's anti-naturalistic really, the up and down movement,
p294
aVbut it feels like breath.
p295
aVAnd it's very, very simple
p296
aVbecause all that happens
p297
aVis that the puppeteer breathes with his knees.
p298
aa(lp299
VAK: Other emotional stuff.
p300
aVIf I were to touch the horse here
p301
aVon his skin,
p302
aVthe heart puppeteer can shake the body from inside
p303
aVand get the skin to quiver.
p304
aVYou'll notice, of course,
p305
aVthat the puppet is made out of cane lines.
p306
aVAnd I would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice,
p307
aVthat I was making a three-dimensional drawing of a horse
p308
aVthat somehow moves in space.
p309
aVBut of course, it was the cane is light,
p310
aVthe cane is flexible, the cane is durable
p311
aVand the cane is moldable.
p312
aVAnd so it was a very practical reason why it was made of cane.
p313
aa(lp314
VThe skin itself
p315
aVis made out of a see-through nylon mesh,
p316
aVwhich, if the lighting designer
p317
aVwants the horse to almost disappear,
p318
aVshe can light the background
p319
aVand the horse becomes ghostlike.
p320
aVYou see the skeletal structure of it.
p321
aVOr if you light it from above, it becomes more solid.
p322
aVAgain, that was a practical consideration.
p323
aVThe guys inside the horse have to be able to see out.
p324
aVThey have to be able to act
p325
aValong with their fellow actors in the production.
p326
aVAnd it's very much an in-the-moment activity that they're engaged in.
p327
aVIt's three heads making one character.
p328
aa(lp329
VBut now we would like you to put Joey through some paces.
p330
aVAnd plant.
p331
aa(lp332
V(Whinny)
p333
aa(lp334
VThank you.
p335
aVAnd now just \u2014
p336
aV(Applause)
p337
aVAll the way from sunny California
p338
aVwe have Zem Joaquin
p339
aVwho's going to ride the horse for us.
p340
aa(lp341
V(Applause)
p342
aa(lp343
V(Applause)
p344
aa(lp345
V(Music)
p346
aa(lp347
VSo we would like to stress
p348
aVthat the performance you see in the horse
p349
aVis three guys
p350
aVwho have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly.
p351
aa(lp352
VBJ: Not being able to talk to one another
p353
aVwhile they're onstage
p354
aVbecause they're mic'd.
p355
aVThe sound that that very large chest makes, of the horse \u2014
p356
aVthe whinnying and the nickering and everything \u2014
p357
aVthat starts usually with one performer,
p358
aVcarries on with a second person
p359
aVand ends with a third.
p360
aa(lp361
VAK: Mikey Brett from Leicestershire.
p362
aV(Applause)
p363
aVMikey Brett, Craig, Leo,
p364
aVZem Joaquin and Basil and me.
p365
aa(lp366
V(Applause)
p367
aa(lp368
VThank you. Thank you.

VOver the next five minutes,
p5
aVmy intention is to transform your relationship with sound.
p6
aVLet me start with the observation
p7
aVthat most of the sound around us is accidental;
p8
aVmuch of it is unpleasant. (Traffic noise)
p9
aVWe stand on street corners, shouting over noise like this,
p10
aVpretending it doesn't exist.
p11
aVThis habit of suppressing sound has meant
p12
aVthat our relationship with sound has become largely unconscious.
p13
aa(lp14
VThere are four major ways sound is affecting you all the time,
p15
aVand I'd like to raise them in your consciousness today.
p16
aVThe first is physiological.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Alarm clocks ring)
p19
aa(lp20
VSorry about that.
p21
aVI just gave you a shot of cortisol, your fight-flight hormone.
p22
aVSounds are affecting your hormone secretions all the time,
p23
aVbut also your breathing, heart rate \u2014 which I just also did \u2014
p24
aVand your brainwaves.
p25
aa(lp26
VIt's not just unpleasant sounds like that that do it.
p27
aVThis is surf. (Ocean waves)
p28
aVIt has the frequency of roughly 12 cycles per minute.
p29
aVMost people find that very soothing,
p30
aVand, interestingly, 12 cycles per minute is roughly the frequency
p31
aVof the breathing of a sleeping human,
p32
aVso there is a deep resonance with being at rest.
p33
aVWe also associate it with being stress-free and on holiday.
p34
aa(lp35
VThe second way in which sound affects you is psychological.
p36
aVMusic is the most powerful form of sound that we know
p37
aVthat affects our emotional state. (Albinoni's Adagio)
p38
aVThis is guaranteed to make most of you feel pretty sad if I leave it on.
p39
aVMusic is not the only kind of sound, however, which affects your emotions.
p40
aa(lp41
VNatural sound can do that, too.
p42
aVBirdsong, for example, is a sound which most people find reassuring.
p43
aVThere's a reason: over hundreds of thousands of years
p44
aVwe've learned that when the birds are singing, things are safe.
p45
aVIt's when they stop you need to be worried.
p46
aa(lp47
VThe third way in which sound affects you is cognitively.
p48
aVYou can't understand two people talking at once (Voice-over)
p49
aVor in this case, one person talking twice.
p50
aVYou have to choose which me you're going to listen to.
p51
aa(lp52
VWe have a very small amount of bandwidth for processing auditory input,
p53
aVwhich is why noise like this ...
p54
aa(lp55
V(Office noise)
p56
aa(lp57
Vis extremely damaging for productivity.
p58
aVIf you have to work in an open-plan office like this,
p59
aVyour productivity is greatly reduced.
p60
aVAnd whatever number you're thinking of, it probably isn't as bad as this.
p61
aa(lp62
V[Open-plan offices productivity down 66%]
p63
aa(lp64
VYou are one-third as productive in open-plan offices as in quiet rooms.
p65
aVI have a tip for you:
p66
aVif you work in spaces like that, carry headphones with you,
p67
aVwith a soothing sound like birdsong.
p68
aVPut them on, and your productivity goes back up to triple what it would be.
p69
aa(lp70
VThe fourth way in which sound affects us is behaviorally.
p71
aVWith all that other stuff going on,
p72
aVit would be amazing if our behavior didn't change.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Techno music)
p75
aa(lp76
VSo ask yourself: Is this person ever going to drive
p77
aVat a steady 28 miles per hour?
p78
aVI don't think so.
p79
aVAt the simplest, you move away from unpleasant sound
p80
aVand towards pleasant sounds.
p81
aVSo if I were to play this ...
p82
aa(lp83
V(Jackhammer)
p84
aa(lp85
Vfor more than a few seconds, you'd feel uncomfortable;
p86
aVfor more than a few minutes, you'd be leaving the room in droves.
p87
aVFor people who can't get away from noise like that,
p88
aVit's extremely damaging for their health.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd that's not the only thing that bad sound damages.
p91
aVMost retail sound is inappropriate and accidental, even hostile,
p92
aVand it has a dramatic effect on sales.
p93
aVFor you retailers, you may want to look away before I show this slide.
p94
aa(lp95
V[Inappropriate retail soundscapes sales down 28%]
p96
aa(lp97
VThey're losing up to 30 percent of their business
p98
aVwith people leaving shops faster, or just turning around at the door.
p99
aVWe've all done it, left the area,
p100
aVbecause the sound in there is so dreadful.
p101
aa(lp102
VI want to spend just a moment talking about the model we've developed,
p103
aVwhich allows us to start at the top and look at the drivers of sound,
p104
aVanalyze the soundscape
p105
aVand then predict the four outcomes I just talked about.
p106
aVOr start at the bottom and say what outcomes we want,
p107
aVand then design a soundscape to have a desired effect.
p108
aVAt last we've got some science we can apply.
p109
aVAnd we're in the business of designing soundscapes.
p110
aa(lp111
VJust a word on music.
p112
aVMusic is the most powerful sound there is, often inappropriately deployed.
p113
aVIt's powerful for two reasons:
p114
aVyou recognize it fast, and you associate it very powerfully.
p115
aVI'll give you two examples.
p116
aa(lp117
V(First chord of "A Hard Day's Night")
p118
aa(lp119
VMost of you recognize that immediately.
p120
aVThe younger, maybe not.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
V(First notes of "Jaws" theme)
p125
aa(lp126
VMost of you associate that with something!
p127
aVNow, those are one-second samples of music.
p128
aVMusic is very powerful,
p129
aVand unfortunately, it's veneering commercial spaces, often inappropriately.
p130
aVI hope that's going to change over the next few years.
p131
aa(lp132
VLet me talk about brands for a moment, since some of you run brands.
p133
aVEvery brand is out there making sound right now.
p134
aVThere are eight expressions of a brand in sound; they're all important.
p135
aVAnd every brand needs to have guidelines at the center.
p136
aVI'm glad to say that is starting to happen now.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Intel ad jingle)
p139
aa(lp140
VYou all recognize that one.
p141
aa(lp142
V(Nokia ringtone)
p143
aa(lp144
VThis is the most-played tune in the world today \u2014
p145
aV1.8 billion times a day, that tune is played.
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VAnd it cost Nokia absolutely nothing.
p150
aa(lp151
VI'll leave you with four golden rules, for those of you who run businesses,
p152
aVfor commercial sound.
p153
aVFirst, make it congruent,
p154
aVpointing in the same direction as your visual communication.
p155
aVThat increases impact by over 1,100 percent.
p156
aVIf your sound is pointing the opposite direction, incongruent,
p157
aVyou reduce impact by 86 percent.
p158
aVThat's an order of magnitude, up or down.
p159
aVThis is important.
p160
aVSecondly, make it appropriate to the situation.
p161
aVThirdly, make it valuable.
p162
aVGive people something with the sound, don't just bombard them with stuff.
p163
aVFinally, test and test it again.
p164
aVSound is complex; there are many countervailing influences.
p165
aVIt can be a bit like a bowl of spaghetti:
p166
aVsometimes you just have to eat it and see what happens.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo I hope this talk has raised sound in your consciousness.
p169
aVIf you're listening consciously,
p170
aVyou can take control of the sound around you.
p171
aVIt's good for your health and for your productivity.
p172
aVIf we all do that, we move to a state
p173
aVthat I like to think will be sound living in the world.
p174
aVI'll leave you with more birdsong. (Birds chirping)
p175
aVI recommend at least five minutes a day, but there's no maximum dose.
p176
aa(lp177
VThank you for lending me your ears today.
p178
aa(lp179
V(Applause)

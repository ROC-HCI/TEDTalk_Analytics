VChris Anderson: So, this is an interview with a difference.
p5
aVOn the basis that a picture is worth a thousand words,
p6
aVwhat I did was, I asked Bill and Melinda
p7
aVto dig out from their archive
p8
aVsome images that would help explain
p9
aVsome of what they've done,
p10
aVand do a few things that way.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo, we're going to start here.
p13
aVMelinda, when and where was this,
p14
aVand who is that handsome man next to you?
p15
aa(lp16
VMelinda Gates: With those big glasses, huh?
p17
aVThis is in Africa, our very first trip,
p18
aVthe first time either of us had ever been to Africa,
p19
aVin the fall of 1993.
p20
aVWe were already engaged to be married.
p21
aVWe married a few months later,
p22
aVand this was the trip where we really went to see
p23
aVthe animals and to see the savanna.
p24
aVIt was incredible. Bill had never taken that much time
p25
aVoff from work.
p26
aVBut what really touched us, actually, were the people,
p27
aVand the extreme poverty.
p28
aVWe started asking ourselves questions.
p29
aVDoes it have to be like this?
p30
aVAnd at the end of the trip,
p31
aVwe went out to Zanzibar,
p32
aVand took some time to walk on the beach,
p33
aVwhich is something we had done a lot
p34
aVwhile we were dating.
p35
aVAnd we'd already been talking about during that time
p36
aVthat the wealth that had come from Microsoft
p37
aVwould be given back to society,
p38
aVbut it was really on that beach walk
p39
aVthat we started to talk about, well,
p40
aVwhat might we do and how might we go about it?
p41
aa(lp42
VCA: So, given that this vacation
p43
aVled to the creation of
p44
aVthe world's biggest private foundation,
p45
aVit's pretty expensive as vacations go. (Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VMG: I guess so. We enjoyed it.
p48
aa(lp49
VCA: Which of you was the key instigator here,
p50
aVor was it symmetrical?
p51
aVBill Gates: Well, I think we were excited
p52
aVthat there'd be a phase of our life
p53
aVwhere we'd get to work together
p54
aVand figure out how to give this money back.
p55
aVAt this stage, we were talking about the poorest,
p56
aVand could you have a big impact on them?
p57
aVWere there things that weren't being done?
p58
aVThere was a lot we didn't know.
p59
aVOur naïveté is pretty incredible,
p60
aVwhen we look back on it.
p61
aVBut we had a certain enthusiasm
p62
aVthat that would be the phase,
p63
aVthe post-Microsoft phase
p64
aVwould be our philanthropy.
p65
aa(lp66
VMG: Which Bill always thought was going to come
p67
aVafter he was 60,
p68
aVso he hasn't quite hit 60 yet,
p69
aVso some things change along the way.
p70
aa(lp71
VCA: So it started there, but it got accelerated.
p72
aVSo that was '93, and it was '97, really,
p73
aVbefore the foundation itself started.
p74
aa(lp75
VMA: Yeah, in '97, we read an article
p76
aVabout diarrheal diseases killing so many kids around the world,
p77
aVand we kept saying to ourselves,
p78
aV"Well that can't be.
p79
aVIn the U.S., you just go down to the drug store."
p80
aVAnd so we started gathering scientists
p81
aVand started learning about population,
p82
aVlearning about vaccines,
p83
aVlearning about what had worked and what had failed,
p84
aVand that's really when we got going,
p85
aVwas in late 1998, 1999.
p86
aa(lp87
VCA: So, you've got a big pot of money
p88
aVand a world full of so many different issues.
p89
aVHow on Earth do you decide what to focus on?
p90
aa(lp91
VBG: Well, we decided that we'd pick two causes,
p92
aVwhatever the biggest inequity was globally,
p93
aVand there we looked at children dying,
p94
aVchildren not having enough nutrition to ever develop,
p95
aVand countries that were really stuck,
p96
aVbecause with that level of death,
p97
aVand parents would have so many kids
p98
aVthat they'd get huge population growth,
p99
aVand that the kids were so sick
p100
aVthat they really couldn't be educated
p101
aVand lift themselves up.
p102
aVSo that was our global thing,
p103
aVand then in the U.S.,
p104
aVboth of us have had amazing educations,
p105
aVand we saw that as the way that the U.S.
p106
aVcould live up to its promise of equal opportunity
p107
aVis by having a phenomenal education system,
p108
aVand the more we learned, the more we realized
p109
aVwe're not really fulfilling that promise.
p110
aVAnd so we picked those two things,
p111
aVand everything the foundation does
p112
aVis focused there.
p113
aa(lp114
VCA: So, I asked each of you to pick an image
p115
aVthat you like that illustrates your work,
p116
aVand Melinda, this is what you picked.
p117
aVWhat's this about?
p118
aa(lp119
VMG: So I, one of the things I love to do when I travel
p120
aVis to go out to the rural areas and talk to the women,
p121
aVwhether it's Bangladesh, India, lots of countries in Africa,
p122
aVand I go in as a Western woman without a name.
p123
aVI don't tell them who I am. Pair of khakis.
p124
aVAnd I kept hearing from women,
p125
aVover and over and over, the more I traveled,
p126
aV"I want to be able to use this shot."
p127
aVI would be there to talk to them about childhood vaccines,
p128
aVand they would bring the conversation around to
p129
aV"But what about the shot I get?"
p130
aVwhich is an injection they were getting called Depo-Provera,
p131
aVwhich is a contraceptive.
p132
aVAnd I would come back and talk to global health experts,
p133
aVand they'd say, "Oh no, contraceptives
p134
aVare stocked in in the developing world."
p135
aVWell, you had to dig deeper into the reports,
p136
aVand this is what the team came to me with,
p137
aVwhich is, to have the number one thing
p138
aVthat women tell you in Africa they want to use
p139
aVstocked out more than 200 days a year
p140
aVexplains why women were saying to me,
p141
aV"I walked 10 kilometers without my husband knowing it,
p142
aVand I got to the clinic, and there was nothing there."
p143
aVAnd so condoms were stocked in in Africa
p144
aVbecause of all the AIDS work that the U.S.
p145
aVand others supported.
p146
aVBut women will tell you over and over again,
p147
aV"I can't negotiate a condom with my husband.
p148
aVI'm either suggesting he has AIDS or I have AIDS,
p149
aVand I need that tool because then I can space
p150
aVthe births of my children, and I can feed them
p151
aVand have a chance of educating them."
p152
aa(lp153
VCA: Melinda, you're Roman Catholic,
p154
aVand you've often been embroiled
p155
aVin controversy over this issue,
p156
aVand on the abortion question,
p157
aVon both sides, really.
p158
aVHow do you navigate that?
p159
aa(lp160
VMG: Yeah, so I think that's a really important point,
p161
aVwhich is, we had backed away from contraceptives
p162
aVas a global community.
p163
aVWe knew that 210 million women
p164
aVwere saying they wanted access to contraceptives,
p165
aVeven the contraceptives we have here in the United States,
p166
aVand we weren't providing them
p167
aVbecause of the political controversy in our country,
p168
aVand to me that was just a crime,
p169
aVand I kept looking around trying to find the person
p170
aVthat would get this back on the global stage,
p171
aVand I finally realized I just had to do it.
p172
aVAnd even though I'm Catholic,
p173
aVI believe in contraceptives
p174
aVjust like most of the Catholic women in the United States
p175
aVwho report using contraceptives,
p176
aVand I shouldn't let that controversy
p177
aVbe the thing that holds us back.
p178
aVWe used to have consensus in the United States
p179
aVaround contraceptives,
p180
aVand so we got back to that global consensus,
p181
aVand actually raised 2.6 billion dollars
p182
aVaround exactly this issue for women.
p183
aV(Applause)
p184
aa(lp185
VCA: Bill, this is your graph. What's this about?
p186
aa(lp187
VBG: Well, my graph has numbers on it.
p188
aV(Laughter)
p189
aVI really like this graph.
p190
aVThis is the number of children
p191
aVwho die before the age of five every year.
p192
aVAnd what you find is really
p193
aVa phenomenal success story
p194
aVwhich is not widely known,
p195
aVthat we are making incredible progress.
p196
aVWe go from 20 million
p197
aVnot long after I was born
p198
aVto now we're down to about six million.
p199
aVSo this is a story
p200
aVlargely of vaccines.
p201
aVSmallpox was killing a couple million kids a year.
p202
aVThat was eradicated, so that got down to zero.
p203
aVMeasles was killing a couple million a year.
p204
aVThat's down to a few hundred thousand.
p205
aVAnyway, this is a chart
p206
aVwhere you want to get that number to continue,
p207
aVand it's going to be possible,
p208
aVusing the science of new vaccines,
p209
aVgetting the vaccines out to kids.
p210
aVWe can actually accelerate the progress.
p211
aVThe last decade,
p212
aVthat number has dropped faster
p213
aVthan ever in history,
p214
aVand so I just love the fact that
p215
aVyou can say, okay, if we can invent new vaccines,
p216
aVwe can get them out there,
p217
aVuse the very latest understanding of these things,
p218
aVand get the delivery right, that we can perform a miracle.
p219
aa(lp220
VCA: I mean, you do the math on this,
p221
aVand it works out, I think, literally
p222
aVto thousands of kids' lives saved every day
p223
aVcompared to the prior year.
p224
aVIt's not reported.
p225
aVAn airliner with 200-plus deaths
p226
aVis a far, far bigger story than that.
p227
aVDoes that drive you crazy?
p228
aa(lp229
VBG: Yeah, because it's a silent thing going on.
p230
aVIt's a kid, one kid at a time.
p231
aVNinety-eight percent of this
p232
aVhas nothing to do with natural disasters,
p233
aVand yet, people's charity,
p234
aVwhen they see a natural disaster, are wonderful.
p235
aVIt's incredible how people think, okay,
p236
aVthat could be me, and the money flows.
p237
aVThese causes have been a bit invisible.
p238
aVNow that the Millennium Development Goals
p239
aVand various things are getting out there,
p240
aVwe are seeing some increased generosity,
p241
aVso the goal is to get this well below a million,
p242
aVwhich should be possible in our lifetime.
p243
aa(lp244
VCA: Maybe it needed someone
p245
aVwho is turned on by numbers and graphs
p246
aVrather than just the big, sad face
p247
aVto get engaged.
p248
aVI mean, you've used it in your letter this year,
p249
aVyou used basically this argument to say that aid,
p250
aVcontrary to the current meme
p251
aVthat aid is kind of worthless and broken,
p252
aVthat actually it has been effective.
p253
aa(lp254
VBG: Yeah, well people can take,
p255
aVthere is some aid that was well-meaning
p256
aVand didn't go well.
p257
aVThere's some venture capital investments
p258
aVthat were well-meaning and didn't go well.
p259
aVYou shouldn't just say, okay, because of that,
p260
aVbecause we don't have a perfect record,
p261
aVthis is a bad endeavor.
p262
aVYou should look at, what was your goal?
p263
aVHow are you trying to uplift nutrition
p264
aVand survival and literacy
p265
aVso these countries can take care of themselves,
p266
aVand say wow, this is going well,
p267
aVand be smarter.
p268
aVWe can spend aid smarter.
p269
aVIt is not all a panacea.
p270
aVWe can do better than venture capital, I think,
p271
aVincluding big hits like this.
p272
aa(lp273
VCA: Traditional wisdom is that
p274
aVit's pretty hard for married couples to work together.
p275
aVHow have you guys managed it?
p276
aVMG: Yeah, I've had a lot of women say to me,
p277
aV"I really don't think I could work with my husband.
p278
aVThat just wouldn't work out."
p279
aVYou know, we enjoy it, and we don't \u2014
p280
aVthis foundation has been a coming to for both of us
p281
aVin its continuous learning journey,
p282
aVand we don't travel together as much
p283
aVfor the foundation, actually, as we used to
p284
aVwhen Bill was working at Microsoft.
p285
aVWe have more trips where we're traveling separately,
p286
aVbut I always know when I come home,
p287
aVBill's going to be interested in what I learned,
p288
aVwhether it's about women or girls
p289
aVor something new about the vaccine delivery chain,
p290
aVor this person that is a great leader.
p291
aVHe's going to listen and be really interested.
p292
aVAnd he knows when he comes home,
p293
aVeven if it's to talk about the speech he did
p294
aVor the data or what he's learned,
p295
aVI'm really interested,
p296
aVand I think we have a really collaborative relationship.
p297
aVBut we don't every minute together, that's for sure.
p298
aV(Laughter)
p299
aa(lp300
VCA: But now you are, and we're very happy that you are.
p301
aVMelinda, early on, you were basically
p302
aVlargely running the show.
p303
aVSix years ago, I guess,
p304
aVBill came on full time, so moved from Microsoft
p305
aVand became full time.
p306
aVThat must have been hard,
p307
aVadjusting to that. No?
p308
aa(lp309
VMG: Yeah. I think actually,
p310
aVfor the foundation employees,
p311
aVthere was way more angst for them
p312
aVthan there was for me about Bill coming.
p313
aVI was actually really excited.
p314
aVI mean, Bill made this decision
p315
aVeven obviously before it got announced in 2006,
p316
aVand it was really his decision,
p317
aVbut again, it was a beach vacation
p318
aVwhere we were walking on the beach
p319
aVand he was starting to think of this idea.
p320
aVAnd for me, the excitement of Bill
p321
aVputting his brain and his heart
p322
aVagainst these huge global problems,
p323
aVthese inequities, to me that was exciting.
p324
aVYes, the foundation employees had angst about that.
p325
aV(Applause)
p326
aa(lp327
VCA: That's cool.
p328
aa(lp329
VMG: But that went away within three months,
p330
aVonce he was there.
p331
aa(lp332
VBG: Including some of the employees.
p333
aa(lp334
VMG: That's what I said, the employees,
p335
aVit went away for them three months after you were there.
p336
aa(lp337
VBG: No, I'm kidding. MG: Oh, you mean, the employees didn't go away.
p338
aa(lp339
VBG: A few of them did, but \u2014
p340
aV(Laughter)
p341
aa(lp342
VCA: So what do you guys argue about?
p343
aVSunday, 11 o'clock,
p344
aVyou're away from work,
p345
aVwhat comes up? What's the argument?
p346
aa(lp347
VBG: Because we built this thing
p348
aVtogether from the beginning,
p349
aVit's this great partnership.
p350
aVI had that with Paul Allen
p351
aVin the early days of Microsoft.
p352
aVI had it with Steve Ballmer as Microsoft got bigger,
p353
aVand now Melinda, and in even stronger,
p354
aVequal ways, is the partner,
p355
aVso we talk a lot about
p356
aVwhich things should we give more to,
p357
aVwhich groups are working well?
p358
aVShe's got a lot of insight.
p359
aVShe'll sit down with the employees a lot.
p360
aVWe'll take the different trips she described.
p361
aVSo there's a lot of collaboration.
p362
aVI can't think of anything where one of us
p363
aVhad a super strong opinion
p364
aVabout one thing or another?
p365
aa(lp366
VCA: How about you, Melinda,  though? Can you? (Laughter)
p367
aVYou never know.
p368
aa(lp369
VMG: Well, here's the thing.
p370
aVWe come at things from different angles,
p371
aVand I actually think that's really good.
p372
aVSo Bill can look at the big data
p373
aVand say, "I want to act based on these global statistics."
p374
aVFor me, I come at it from intuition.
p375
aVI meet with lots of people on the ground
p376
aVand Bill's taught me to take that
p377
aVand read up to the global data and see if they match,
p378
aVand I think what I've taught him
p379
aVis to take that data
p380
aVand meet with people on the ground to understand,
p381
aVcan you actually deliver that vaccine?
p382
aVCan you get a woman to accept those polio drops
p383
aVin her child's mouth?
p384
aVBecause the delivery piece
p385
aVis every bit as important as the science.
p386
aVSo I think it's been more a coming to over time
p387
aVtowards each other's point of view,
p388
aVand quite frankly, the work is better because of it.
p389
aa(lp390
VCA: So, in vaccines and polio and so forth,
p391
aVyou've had some amazing successes.
p392
aVWhat about failure, though?
p393
aVCan you talk about a failure
p394
aVand maybe what you've learned from it?
p395
aa(lp396
VBG: Yeah. Fortunately, we can afford a few failures,
p397
aVbecause we've certainly had them.
p398
aVWe do a lot of drug work or vaccine work
p399
aVthat you know you're going to have different failures.
p400
aVLike, we put out, one that got a lot of publicity
p401
aVwas asking for a better condom.
p402
aVWell, we got hundreds of ideas.
p403
aVMaybe a few of those will work out.
p404
aVWe were very naïve, certainly I was, about a drug
p405
aVfor a disease in India, visceral leishmaniasis,
p406
aVthat I thought, once I got this drug,
p407
aVwe can just go wipe out the disease.
p408
aVWell, turns out it took an injection
p409
aVevery day for 10 days.
p410
aVIt took three more years to get it than we expected,
p411
aVand then there was no way
p412
aVit was going to get out there.
p413
aVFortunately, we found out
p414
aVthat if you go kill the sand flies,
p415
aVyou probably can have success there,
p416
aVbut we spent five years,
p417
aVyou could say wasted five years,
p418
aVand about 60 million,
p419
aVon a path that turned out to have
p420
aVvery modest benefit when we got there.
p421
aa(lp422
VCA: You're spending, like, a billion dollars a year
p423
aVin education, I think, something like that.
p424
aVIs anything, the story of what's gone right there
p425
aVis quite a long and complex one.
p426
aVAre there any failures that you can talk about?
p427
aa(lp428
VMG: Well, I would say a huge lesson for us
p429
aVout of the early work is we thought
p430
aVthat these small schools were the answer,
p431
aVand small schools definitely help.
p432
aVThey bring down the dropout rate.
p433
aVThey have less violence and crime in those schools.
p434
aVBut the thing that we learned from that work,
p435
aVand what turned out to be the fundamental key,
p436
aVis a great teacher in front of the classroom.
p437
aVIf you don't have an effective teacher
p438
aVin the front of the classroom,
p439
aVI don't care how big or small the building is,
p440
aVyou're not going to change the trajectory
p441
aVof whether that student will be ready for college.
p442
aV(Applause)
p443
aa(lp444
VCA: So Melinda, this is you and
p445
aVyour eldest daughter, Jenn.
p446
aVAnd just taken about three weeks ago, I think,
p447
aVthree or four weeks ago. Where was this?
p448
aa(lp449
VMG: So we went to Tanzania.
p450
aVJenn's been to Tanzania.
p451
aVAll our kids have been to Africa quite a bit, actually.
p452
aVAnd we did something very different,
p453
aVwhich is, we decided to go spend
p454
aVtwo nights and three days with a family.
p455
aVAnna and Sanare are the parents.
p456
aVThey invited us to come and stay in their boma.
p457
aVActually, the goats had been there, I think,
p458
aVliving in that particular little hut
p459
aVon their little compound before we got there.
p460
aVAnd we stayed with their family,
p461
aVand we really, really learned
p462
aVwhat life is like in rural Tanzania.
p463
aVAnd the difference between just going
p464
aVand visiting for half a day
p465
aVor three quarters of a day
p466
aVversus staying overnight was profound,
p467
aVand so let me just give you one explanation of that.
p468
aVThey had six children, and as I talked to Anna
p469
aVin the kitchen, we cooked for about five hours
p470
aVin the cooking hut that day,
p471
aVand as I talked to her, she had absolutely planned
p472
aVand spaced with her husband
p473
aVthe births of their children.
p474
aVIt was a very loving relationship.
p475
aVThis was a Maasai warrior and his wife,
p476
aVbut they had decided to get married,
p477
aVthey clearly had respect and love in the relationship.
p478
aVTheir children, their six children,
p479
aVthe two in the middle were twins, 13,
p480
aVa boy, and a girl named Grace.
p481
aVAnd when we'd go out to chop wood
p482
aVand do all the things that Grace and her mother would do,
p483
aVGrace was not a child, she was an adolescent,
p484
aVbut she wasn't an adult.
p485
aVShe was very, very shy.
p486
aVSo she kept wanting to talk to me and Jenn.
p487
aVWe kept trying to engage her, but she was shy.
p488
aVAnd at night, though,
p489
aVwhen all the lights went out in rural Tanzania,
p490
aVand there was no moon that night,
p491
aVthe first night, and no stars,
p492
aVand Jenn came out of our hut
p493
aVwith her REI little headlamp on,
p494
aVGrace went immediately,
p495
aVand got the translator,
p496
aVcame straight up to my Jenn and said,
p497
aV"When you go home,
p498
aVcan I have your headlamp
p499
aVso I can study at night?"
p500
aa(lp501
VCA: Oh, wow.
p502
aa(lp503
VMG: And her dad had told me
p504
aVhow afraid he was that unlike the son,
p505
aVwho had passed his secondary exams,
p506
aVbecause of her chores,
p507
aVshe'd not done so well
p508
aVand wasn't in the government school yet.
p509
aVHe said, "I don't know how I'm going to pay for her education.
p510
aVI can't pay for private school,
p511
aVand she may end up on this farm like my wife."
p512
aVSo they know the difference
p513
aVthat an education can make
p514
aVin a huge, profound way.
p515
aa(lp516
VCA: I mean, this is another pic
p517
aVof your other two kids, Rory and Phoebe,
p518
aValong with Paul Farmer.
p519
aVBringing up three children
p520
aVwhen you're the world's richest family
p521
aVseems like a social experiment
p522
aVwithout much prior art.
p523
aVHow have you managed it?
p524
aVWhat's been your approach?
p525
aa(lp526
VBG: Well, I'd say overall
p527
aVthe kids get a great education,
p528
aVbut you've got to make sure
p529
aVthey have a sense of their own ability
p530
aVand what they're going to go and do,
p531
aVand our philosophy has been
p532
aVto be very clear with them \u2014
p533
aVmost of the money's going to the foundation \u2014
p534
aVand help them find something they're excited about.
p535
aVWe want to strike a balance where they have
p536
aVthe freedom to do anything
p537
aVbut not a lot of money showered on them
p538
aVso they could go out and do nothing.
p539
aVAnd so far, they're fairly diligent,
p540
aVexcited to pick their own direction.
p541
aa(lp542
VCA: You've obviously guarded their  privacy carefully for obvious reasons.
p543
aVI'm curious why you've given me permission
p544
aVto show this picture now here at TED.
p545
aVMG: Well, it's interesting.
p546
aVAs they get older, they so know
p547
aVthat our family belief is about responsibility,
p548
aVthat we are in an unbelievable situation
p549
aVjust to live in the United States
p550
aVand have a great education,
p551
aVand we have a responsibility to give back to the world.
p552
aVAnd so as they get older
p553
aVand we are teaching them \u2014
p554
aVthey have been to so many countries around the world \u2014
p555
aVthey're saying,
p556
aVwe do want people to know that we believe
p557
aVin what you're doing, Mom and Dad,
p558
aVand it is okay to show us more.
p559
aVSo we have their permission to show this picture,
p560
aVand I think Paul Farmer is probably going to put it
p561
aVeventually in some of his work.
p562
aVBut they really care deeply
p563
aVabout the mission of the foundation, too.
p564
aa(lp565
VCA: You've easily got enough money
p566
aVdespite your vast contributions to the foundation
p567
aVto make them all billionaires.
p568
aVIs that your plan for them?
p569
aa(lp570
VBG: Nope. No. They won't have anything like that.
p571
aVThey need to have a sense
p572
aVthat their own work is meaningful and important.
p573
aVWe read an article long, actually, before we got married,
p574
aVwhere Warren Buffett talked about that,
p575
aVand we're quite convinced that it wasn't a favor
p576
aVeither to society or to the kids.
p577
aa(lp578
VCA: Well, speaking of Warren Buffett,
p579
aVsomething really amazing happened in 2006,
p580
aVwhen somehow your only real rival
p581
aVfor richest person in America
p582
aVsuddenly turned around and agreed to give
p583
aV80 percent of his fortune
p584
aVto your foundation.
p585
aVHow on Earth did that happen?
p586
aVI guess there's a long version and a short version of that.
p587
aVWe've got time for the short version.
p588
aa(lp589
VBG: All right. Well, Warren was a close friend,
p590
aVand he was going to have his wife Suzie
p591
aVgive it all away.
p592
aVTragically, she passed away before he did,
p593
aVand he's big on delegation, and
p594
aV\u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p595
aVhe said \u2014
p596
aa(lp597
VCA: Tweet that.
p598
aa(lp599
VBG: If he's got somebody who is doing something well,
p600
aVand is willing to do it at no charge,
p601
aVmaybe that's okay. But we were stunned.
p602
aVMG: Totally stunned. BG: We had never expected it,
p603
aVand it has been unbelievable.
p604
aVIt's allowed us to increase our ambition
p605
aVin what the foundation can do quite dramatically.
p606
aVHalf the resources we have
p607
aVcome from Warren's mind-blowing generosity.
p608
aa(lp609
VCA: And I think you've pledged that
p610
aVby the time you're done,
p611
aVmore than, or 95 percent of your wealth,
p612
aVwill be given to the foundation.
p613
aa(lp614
VBG: Yes.
p615
aa(lp616
VCA: And since this relationship, it's amazing\u2014
p617
aV(Applause)
p618
aVAnd recently, you and Warren
p619
aVhave been going around trying to persuade
p620
aVother billionaires and successful people
p621
aVto pledge to give, what,
p622
aVmore than half of their assets for philanthropy.
p623
aVHow is that going?
p624
aVBG: Well, we've got about 120 people
p625
aVwho have now taken this giving pledge.
p626
aVThe thing that's great is that we get together
p627
aVyearly and talk about, okay,
p628
aVdo you hire staff, what do you give to them?
p629
aVWe're not trying to homogenize it.
p630
aVI mean, the beauty of philanthropy
p631
aVis this mind-blowing diversity.
p632
aVPeople give to some things.
p633
aVWe look and go, "Wow."
p634
aVBut that's great.
p635
aVThat's the role of philanthropy
p636
aVis to pick different approaches,
p637
aVincluding even in one space, like education.
p638
aVWe need more experimentation.
p639
aVBut it's been wonderful, meeting those people,
p640
aVsharing their journey to philanthropy,
p641
aVhow they involve their kids,
p642
aVwhere they're doing it differently,
p643
aVand it's been way more successful than we expected.
p644
aVNow it looks like it'll just keep growing in size
p645
aVin the years ahead.
p646
aa(lp647
VMG: And having people see that other people
p648
aVare making change with philanthropy,
p649
aVI mean, these are people who have
p650
aVcreated their own businesses,
p651
aVput their own ingenuity behind incredible ideas.
p652
aVIf they put their ideas and their brain
p653
aVbehind philanthropy, they can change the world.
p654
aVAnd they start to see others doing it, and saying,
p655
aV"Wow, I want to do that with my own money."
p656
aVTo me, that's the piece that's incredible.
p657
aa(lp658
VCA: It seems to me, it's actually really hard
p659
aVfor some people to figure out
p660
aVeven how to remotely spend that much money
p661
aVon something else.
p662
aVThere are probably some billionaires in the room
p663
aVand certainly some successful people.
p664
aVI'm curious, can you make the pitch?
p665
aVWhat's the pitch?
p666
aa(lp667
VBG: Well, it's the most fulfilling thing
p668
aVwe've ever done,
p669
aVand you can't take it with you,
p670
aVand if it's not good for your kids,
p671
aVlet's get together and brainstorm
p672
aVabout what we can be done.
p673
aVThe world is a far better place
p674
aVbecause of the philanthropists of the past,
p675
aVand the U.S. tradition here, which is the strongest,
p676
aVis the envy of the world.
p677
aVAnd part of the reason I'm so optimistic
p678
aVis because I do think philanthropy
p679
aVis going to grow
p680
aVand take some of these things
p681
aVgovernment's not just good at working on and discovering
p682
aVand shine some light in the right direction.
p683
aa(lp684
VCA: The world's got this terrible inequality,
p685
aVgrowing inequality problem
p686
aVthat seems structural.
p687
aVIt does seem to me that if more of your peers
p688
aVtook the approach that you two have made,
p689
aVit would make a dent
p690
aVboth in that problem and certainly
p691
aVin the perception of that problem.
p692
aVIs that a fair comment?
p693
aa(lp694
VBG: Oh yeah. If you take from the most wealthy
p695
aVand give to the least wealthy, it's good.
p696
aVIt tries to balance out, and that's just.
p697
aa(lp698
VMG: But you change systems.
p699
aVIn the U.S., we're trying to change the education system
p700
aVso it's just for everybody
p701
aVand it works for all students.
p702
aVThat, to me, really changes
p703
aVthe inequality balance.
p704
aa(lp705
VBG: That's the most important.
p706
aV(Applause)
p707
aa(lp708
VCA: Well, I really think that most people here
p709
aVand many millions around the world
p710
aVare just in awe of the trajectory
p711
aVyour lives have taken
p712
aVand the spectacular degree to which
p713
aVyou have shaped the future.
p714
aVThank you so much for coming to TED
p715
aVand for sharing with us and for all you do.
p716
aa(lp717
VBG: Thank you. MG: Thank you.
p718
aV(Applause)
p719
aa(lp720
VBG: Thank you. MG: Thank you very much.

In developing countries, the foundation focuses on improving people&#39;s health with vaccines and other life-saving tools and giving them a chance to lift themselves out of hunger and extreme poverty. In the United States, it seeks to dramatically improve education so that all young people have the opportunity to reach their full potential. Based in Seattle, Washington, the foundation is led by CEO Jeff Raikes and co-chair William H. Gates Sr., under the direction of Bill Gates, Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett.</p><p>In recent years, Melinda French Gates has become a vocal advocate for access to contraception, advancing the idea that empowering women to decide whether and when to have children can have transformational effects on societies. In 2012, Gates spearheaded the London Summit on Family Planning, with the goal of delivering contraceptives to 120 million women in developing countries by 2020. When asked why she got involved in this issue, Gates said, &quot;We knew that 210 million women were saying they wanted access to the contraceptives we have here in the United States and we weren&#39;t providing them because of political controversy in our country. To me, that was just a crime. I kept looking around trying to find the person to get this back on the global stage.

In developing countries, the foundation focuses on improving people&#39;s health with vaccines and other life-saving tools and giving them a chance to lift themselves out of hunger and extreme poverty. In the United States, it seeks to dramatically improve education so that all young people have the opportunity to reach their full potential. Based in Seattle, Washington, the foundation is led by CEO Jeff Raikes and co-chair William H. Gates Sr., under the direction of Bill Gates, Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett.</p><p>In recent years, Melinda French Gates has become a vocal advocate for access to contraception, advancing the idea that empowering women to decide whether and when to have children can have transformational effects on societies. In 2012, Gates spearheaded the London Summit on Family Planning, with the goal of delivering contraceptives to 120 million women in developing countries by 2020. When asked why she got involved in this issue, Gates said, &quot;We knew that 210 million women were saying they wanted access to the contraceptives we have here in the United States and we weren&#39;t providing them because of political controversy in our country. To me, that was just a crime. I kept looking around trying to find the person to get this back on the global stage.

VAs it turns out, when tens of millions of people are unemployed
p5
aVor underemployed,
p6
aVthere's a fair amount of interest in what technology might be doing
p7
aVto the labor force.
p8
aVAnd as I look at the conversation,
p9
aVit strikes me that it's focused on exactly the right topic,
p10
aVand at the same time, it's missing the point entirely.
p11
aVThe topic that it's focused on,
p12
aVthe question is whether or not all these digital technologies are affecting
p13
aVpeople's ability to earn a living,
p14
aVor, to say it a little bit different way,
p15
aVare the droids taking our jobs?
p16
aVAnd there's some evidence that they are.
p17
aa(lp18
VThe Great Recession ended when American GDP resumed
p19
aVits kind of slow, steady march upward,
p20
aVand some other economic indicators also started to rebound,
p21
aVand they got kind of healthy kind of quickly.
p22
aVCorporate profits are quite high;
p23
aVin fact, if you include bank profits,
p24
aVthey're higher than they've ever been.
p25
aVAnd business investment in gear \u2014 in equipment
p26
aVand hardware and software \u2014 is at an all-time high.
p27
aVSo the businesses are getting out their checkbooks.
p28
aVWhat they're not really doing is hiring.
p29
aVSo this red line
p30
aVis the employment-to-population ratio,
p31
aVin other words, the percentage of working-age people in America
p32
aVwho have work.
p33
aVAnd we see that it cratered during the Great Recession,
p34
aVand it hasn't started to bounce back at all.
p35
aa(lp36
VBut the story is not just a recession story.
p37
aVThe decade that we've just been through had
p38
aVrelatively anemic job growth all throughout,
p39
aVespecially when we compare it to other decades,
p40
aVand the 2000s are the only time we have on record
p41
aVwhere there were fewer people working at the end of the decade
p42
aVthan at the beginning.
p43
aVThis is not what you want to see.
p44
aVWhen you graph the number of potential employees
p45
aVversus the number of jobs in the country,
p46
aVyou see the gap gets bigger and bigger over time,
p47
aVand then, during the Great Recession, it opened up in a huge way.
p48
aa(lp49
VI did some quick calculations.
p50
aVI took the last 20 years of GDP growth
p51
aVand the last 20 years of labor-productivity growth
p52
aVand used those in a fairly straightforward way
p53
aVto try to project how many jobs the economy was going to need
p54
aVto keep growing,
p55
aVand this is the line that I came up with.
p56
aVIs that good or bad?
p57
aVThis is the government's projection
p58
aVfor the working-age population going forward.
p59
aVSo if these predictions are accurate, that gap is not going to close.
p60
aa(lp61
VThe problem is, I don't think these projections are accurate.
p62
aVIn particular, I think my projection is way too optimistic,
p63
aVbecause when I did it,
p64
aVI was assuming that the future was kind of going to look like the past,
p65
aVwith labor productivity growth,
p66
aVand that's actually not what I believe.
p67
aVBecause when I look around,
p68
aVI think that we ain't seen nothing yet
p69
aVwhen it comes to technology's impact on the labor force.
p70
aa(lp71
VJust in the past couple years, we've seen digital tools
p72
aVdisplay skills and abilities that they never, ever had before,
p73
aVand that kind of eat deeply into what we human beings
p74
aVdo for a living.
p75
aVLet me give you a couple examples.
p76
aa(lp77
VThroughout all of history,
p78
aVif you wanted something translated from one language into another,
p79
aVyou had to involve a human being.
p80
aVNow we have multi-language, instantaneous,
p81
aVautomatic translation services available for free
p82
aVvia many of our devices, all the way down to smartphones.
p83
aVAnd if any of us have used these,
p84
aVwe know that they're not perfect, but they're decent.
p85
aa(lp86
VThroughout all of history, if you wanted something written,
p87
aVa report or an article, you had to involve a person.
p88
aVNot anymore.
p89
aVThis is an article that appeared in Forbes online a while back,
p90
aVabout Apple's earnings.
p91
aVIt was written by an algorithm.
p92
aVAnd it's not decent \u2014 it's perfect.
p93
aa(lp94
VA lot of people look at this and they say,
p95
aV"OK, but those are very specific, narrow tasks,
p96
aVand most knowledge workers are actually generalists.
p97
aVAnd what they do is sit on top of a very large body of expertise and knowledge
p98
aVand they use that to react on the fly to kind of unpredictable demands,
p99
aVand that's very, very hard to automate."
p100
aVOne of the most impressive knowledge workers in recent memory
p101
aVis a guy named Ken Jennings.
p102
aVHe won the quiz show "Jeopardy!" 74 times in a row.
p103
aVTook home three million dollars.
p104
aVThat's Ken on the right, getting beat three-to-one
p105
aVby Watson, the Jeopardy-playing supercomputer from IBM.
p106
aVSo when we look at what technology can do to general knowledge workers,
p107
aVI start to think there might not be something so special
p108
aVabout this idea of a generalist,
p109
aVparticularly when we start doing things like hooking Siri up to Watson,
p110
aVand having technologies that can understand what we're saying
p111
aVand repeat speech back to us.
p112
aa(lp113
VNow, Siri is far from perfect, and we can make fun of her flaws,
p114
aVbut we should also keep in mind
p115
aVthat if technologies like Siri and Watson improve along a Moore's law trajectory,
p116
aVwhich they will,
p117
aVin six years, they're not going to be two times better or four times better,
p118
aVthey'll be 16 times better than they are right now.
p119
aVSo I start to think a lot of knowledge work is going to be affected by this.
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd digital technologies are not just impacting knowledge work,
p122
aVthey're starting to flex their muscles in the physical world as well.
p123
aVI had the chance a little while back to ride in the Google autonomous car,
p124
aVwhich is as cool as it sounds.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd I will vouch that it handled the stop-and-go traffic on US 101
p129
aVvery smoothly.
p130
aVThere are about three and a half million people who drive trucks for a living
p131
aVin the United States;
p132
aVI think some of them are going to be affected by this technology.
p133
aVAnd right now, humanoid robots are still incredibly primitive.
p134
aVThey can't do very much.
p135
aVBut they're getting better quite quickly
p136
aVand DARPA, which is the investment arm of the Defense Department,
p137
aVis trying to accelerate their trajectory.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo, in short, yeah, the droids are coming for our jobs.
p140
aVIn the short term, we can stimulate job growth
p141
aVby encouraging entrepreneurship
p142
aVand by investing in infrastructure,
p143
aVbecause the robots today still aren't very good at fixing bridges.
p144
aVBut in the not-too-long-term,
p145
aVI think within the lifetimes of most of the people in this room,
p146
aVwe're going to transition into an economy that is very productive,
p147
aVbut that just doesn't need a lot of human workers.
p148
aVAnd managing that transition is going to be the greatest challenge
p149
aVthat our society faces.
p150
aVVoltaire summarized why; he said,
p151
aV"Work saves us from three great evils: boredom, vice and need."
p152
aa(lp153
VBut despite this challenge \u2014
p154
aVpersonally, I'm still a huge digital optimist,
p155
aVand I am supremely confident
p156
aVthat the digital technologies that we're developing now
p157
aVare going to take us into a Utopian future,
p158
aVnot a dystopian future.
p159
aVAnd to explain why,
p160
aVI want to pose a ridiculously broad question.
p161
aVI want to ask:
p162
aVwhat have been the most important developments in human history?
p163
aa(lp164
VNow, I want to share some of the answers that I've gotten
p165
aVin response to this question.
p166
aVIt's a wonderful question to ask and start an endless debate about,
p167
aVbecause some people are going to bring up
p168
aVsystems of philosophy in both the West and the East
p169
aVthat have changed how a lot of people think about the world.
p170
aVAnd then other people will say,
p171
aV"No, actually, the big stories, the big developments
p172
aVare the founding of the world's major religions,
p173
aVwhich have changed civilizations and have changed and influenced
p174
aVhow countless people are living their lives."
p175
aVAnd then some other folk will say,
p176
aV"Actually, what changes civilizations,
p177
aVwhat modifies them and what changes people's lives are empires,
p178
aVso the great developments in human history
p179
aVare stories of conquest and of war."
p180
aVAnd then some cheery soul usually always pipes up and says,
p181
aV"Hey, don't forget about plagues!"
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VThere are some optimistic answers to this question,
p186
aVso some people will bring up the Age of Exploration
p187
aVand the opening up of the world.
p188
aVOthers will talk about intellectual achievements in disciplines like math
p189
aVthat have helped us get a better handle on the world,
p190
aVand other folk will talk about periods when there was a deep flourishing
p191
aVof the arts and sciences.
p192
aVSo this debate will go on and on.
p193
aVIt's an endless debate
p194
aVand there's no conclusive, single answer to it.
p195
aVBut if you're a geek like me,
p196
aVyou say, "Well, what do the data say?"
p197
aVAnd you start to do things
p198
aVlike graph things that we might be interested in \u2014
p199
aVthe total worldwide population, for example,
p200
aVor some measure of social development
p201
aVor the state of advancement of a society.
p202
aVAnd you start to plot the data, because, by this approach,
p203
aVthe big stories, the big developments in human history,
p204
aVare the ones that will bend these curves a lot.
p205
aa(lp206
VSo when you do this and when you plot the data,
p207
aVyou pretty quickly come to some weird conclusions.
p208
aVYou conclude, actually,
p209
aVthat none of these things have mattered very much.
p210
aa(lp211
V(Laughter)
p212
aa(lp213
VThey haven't done a darn thing to the curves.
p214
aVThere has been one story, one development in human history
p215
aVthat bent the curve, bent it just about 90 degrees,
p216
aVand it is a technology story.
p217
aa(lp218
VThe steam engine and the other associated technologies
p219
aVof the Industrial Revolution
p220
aVchanged the world and influenced human history so much,
p221
aVthat in the words of the historian Ian Morris,
p222
aV"... they made mockery out of all that had come before."
p223
aVAnd they did this by infinitely multiplying the power of our muscles,
p224
aVovercoming the limitations of our muscles.
p225
aVNow, what we're in the middle of now
p226
aVis overcoming the limitations of our individual brains
p227
aVand infinitely multiplying our mental power.
p228
aVHow can this not be as big a deal
p229
aVas overcoming the limitations of our muscles?
p230
aa(lp231
VSo at the risk of repeating myself a little bit,
p232
aVwhen I look at what's going on with digital technology these days,
p233
aVwe are not anywhere near through with this journey.
p234
aVAnd when I look at what is happening to our economies and our societies,
p235
aVmy single conclusion is that we ain't seen nothing yet.
p236
aVThe best days are really ahead.
p237
aa(lp238
VLet me give you a couple examples.
p239
aVEconomies don't run on energy.
p240
aVThey don't run on capital, they don't run on labor.
p241
aVEconomies run on ideas.
p242
aVSo the work of innovation, the work of coming up with new ideas,
p243
aVis some of the most powerful, most fundamental work that we can do
p244
aVin an economy.
p245
aVAnd this is kind of how we used to do innovation.
p246
aVWe'd find a bunch of fairly similar-looking people ...
p247
aa(lp248
V(Laughter)
p249
aa(lp250
VWe'd take them out of elite institutions,
p251
aVwe'd put them into other elite institutions
p252
aVand we'd wait for the innovation.
p253
aVNow \u2014
p254
aa(lp255
V(Laughter)
p256
aa(lp257
Vas a white guy who spent his whole career at MIT and Harvard,
p258
aVI've got no problem with this.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Laughter)
p261
aa(lp262
VBut some other people do,
p263
aVand they've kind of crashed the party
p264
aVand loosened up the dress code of innovation.
p265
aa(lp266
V(Laughter)
p267
aa(lp268
VSo here are the winners of a Topcoder programming challenge,
p269
aVand I assure you that nobody cares
p270
aVwhere these kids grew up, where they went to school,
p271
aVor what they look like.
p272
aVAll anyone cares about is the quality of the work, the quality of the ideas.
p273
aa(lp274
VAnd over and over again, we see this happening
p275
aVin the technology-facilitated world.
p276
aVThe work of innovation is becoming more open,
p277
aVmore inclusive, more transparent and more merit-based,
p278
aVand that's going to continue no matter what MIT and Harvard think of it,
p279
aVand I couldn't be happier about that development.
p280
aa(lp281
VI hear once in a while, "OK, I'll grant you that,
p282
aVbut technology is still a tool for the rich world,
p283
aVand what's not happening,
p284
aVthese digital tools are not improving the lives
p285
aVof people at the bottom of the pyramid."
p286
aVAnd I want to say to that very clearly: nonsense.
p287
aVThe bottom of the pyramid is benefiting hugely from technology.
p288
aVThe economist Robert Jensen did this wonderful study a while back
p289
aVwhere he watched, in great detail,
p290
aVwhat happened to the fishing villages of Kerala, India,
p291
aVwhen they got mobile phones for the very first time.
p292
aVAnd when you write for the Quarterly Journal of Economics,
p293
aVyou have to use very dry and very circumspect language.
p294
aVBut when I read his paper,
p295
aVI kind of feel Jensen is trying to scream at us
p296
aVand say, "Look, this was a big deal.
p297
aVPrices stabilized, so people could plan their economic lives.
p298
aVWaste was not reduced \u2014 it was eliminated.
p299
aVAnd the lives of both the buyers and the sellers
p300
aVin these villages measurably improved."
p301
aa(lp302
VNow, what I don't think is that Jensen got extremely lucky
p303
aVand happened to land in the one set of villages
p304
aVwhere technology made things better.
p305
aVWhat happened instead is he very carefully documented
p306
aVwhat happens over and over again when technology comes for the first time
p307
aVto an environment and a community:
p308
aVthe lives of people, the welfares of people, improve dramatically.
p309
aa(lp310
VSo as I look around at all the evidence
p311
aVand I think about the room that we have ahead of us,
p312
aVI become a huge digital optimist
p313
aVand I start to think that this wonderful statement from the physicist Freeman Dyson
p314
aVis actually not hyperbole.
p315
aVThis is an accurate assessment of what's going on.
p316
aVOur technologies are great gifts,
p317
aVand we, right now, have the great good fortune
p318
aVto be living at a time when digital technology is flourishing,
p319
aVwhen it is broadening and deepening and becoming more profound
p320
aVall around the world.
p321
aa(lp322
VSo, yeah, the droids are taking our jobs,
p323
aVbut focusing on that fact misses the point entirely.
p324
aVThe point is that then we are freed up to do other things,
p325
aVand what we're going to do, I am very confident,
p326
aVwhat we're going to do is reduce poverty
p327
aVand drudgery and misery around the world.
p328
aVI'm very confident we're going to learn to live more lightly on the planet,
p329
aVand I am extremely confident that what we're going to do
p330
aVwith our new digital tools
p331
aVis going to be so profound and so beneficial
p332
aVthat it's going to make a mockery out of everything that came before.
p333
aVI'm going to leave the last word
p334
aVto a guy who had a front-row seat for digital progress,
p335
aVour old friend Ken Jennings.
p336
aVI'm with him; I'm going to echo his words:
p337
aV"I, for one, welcome our new computer overlords."
p338
aa(lp339
V(Laughter)
p340
aa(lp341
VThanks very much.

VIn India, we have these huge families.
p5
aVI bet a lot of you all must have heard about it.
p6
aVWhich means that there are a lot of family events.
p7
aVSo as a child, my parents used to drag me to these family events.
p8
aa(lp9
VBut the one thing that I always looked forward to
p10
aVwas playing around with my cousins.
p11
aVAnd there was always this one uncle
p12
aVwho used to be there,
p13
aValways ready, jumping around with us,
p14
aVhaving games for us,
p15
aVmaking us kids have the time of our lives.
p16
aVThis man was extremely successful:
p17
aVhe was confident and powerful.
p18
aVBut then I saw this hale and hearty person deteriorate in health.
p19
aVHe was diagnosed with Parkinson's.
p20
aa(lp21
VParkinson's is a disease that causes degeneration of the nervous system,
p22
aVwhich means that this person who used to be independent
p23
aVsuddenly finds tasks like drinking coffee, because of tremors, much more difficult.
p24
aVMy uncle started using a walker to walk,
p25
aVand to take a turn,
p26
aVhe literally had to take one step at a time, like this,
p27
aVand it took forever.
p28
aVSo this person, who used to be the center of attention
p29
aVin every family gathering,
p30
aVwas suddenly hiding behind people.
p31
aVHe was hiding from the pitiful look in people's eyes.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd he's not the only one in the world.
p34
aVEvery year, 60,000 people are newly diagnosed with Parkinson's,
p35
aVand this number is only rising.
p36
aVAs designers, we dream that our designs solve these multifaceted problems,
p37
aVone solution that solves it all,
p38
aVbut it need not always be like that.
p39
aVYou can also target simple problems
p40
aVand create small solutions for them and eventually make a big impact.
p41
aVSo my aim here was to not cure Parkinson's,
p42
aVbut to make their everyday tasks much more simple,
p43
aVand then make an impact.
p44
aa(lp45
VWell, the first thing I targeted was tremors, right?
p46
aVMy uncle told me that he had stopped drinking coffee or tea in public
p47
aVjust out of embarrassment,
p48
aVso, well, I designed the no-spill cup.
p49
aVIt works just purely on its form.
p50
aVThe curve on top deflects the liquid back inside every time they have tremors,
p51
aVand this keeps the liquid inside compared to a normal cup.
p52
aVBut the key here is that it is not tagged as a Parkinson's patient product.
p53
aVIt looks like a cup that could be used by you, me, any clumsy person,
p54
aVand that makes it much more comforting for them to use, to blend in.
p55
aVSo, well, one problem solved,
p56
aVmany more to go.
p57
aa(lp58
VAll this while, I was interviewing him,
p59
aVquestioning him,
p60
aVand then I realized that I was getting very superficial information,
p61
aVor just answers to my questions.
p62
aVBut I really needed to dig deeper to get a new perspective.
p63
aVSo I thought, well, let's observe him in his daily tasks,
p64
aVwhile he's eating, while he's watching TV.
p65
aVAnd then, when I was actually observing him walking to his dining table,
p66
aVit struck me, this man who finds it so difficult to walk on flat land,
p67
aVhow does he climb a staircase?
p68
aVBecause in India we do not have a fancy rail that takes you up a staircase
p69
aVlike in the developed countries.
p70
aVOne actually has to climb the stairs.
p71
aVSo he told me,
p72
aV"Well, let me show you how I do it."
p73
aVLet's take a look at what I saw.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo he took really long to reach this position,
p76
aVand then all this while, I'm thinking,
p77
aV"Oh my God, is he really going to do it?
p78
aVIs he really, really going to do it without his walker?"
p79
aVAnd then ...
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd the turns, he took them so easily.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo \u2014 shocked?
p86
aVWell, I was too.
p87
aVSo this person who could not walk on flat land
p88
aVwas suddenly a pro at climbing stairs.
p89
aa(lp90
VOn researching this, I realized that it's because it's a continuous motion.
p91
aVThere's this other man who also suffers from the same symptoms
p92
aVand uses a walker,
p93
aVbut the moment he's put on a cycle,
p94
aVall his symptoms vanish,
p95
aVbecause it is a continuous motion.
p96
aVSo the key for me was to translate this feeling of walking on a staircase
p97
aVback to flat land.
p98
aVAnd a lot of ideas were tested and tried on him,
p99
aVbut the one that finally worked was this one. Let's take a look.
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
V(Applause)
p104
aa(lp105
VHe walked faster, right?
p106
aa(lp107
V(Applause)
p108
aa(lp109
VI call this the staircase illusion,
p110
aVand actually when the staircase illusion abruptly ended, he froze,
p111
aVand this is called freezing of gait.
p112
aVSo it happens a lot,
p113
aVso why not have a staircase illusion flowing through all their rooms,
p114
aVmaking them feel much more confident?
p115
aVYou know, technology is not always it.
p116
aVWhat we need are human-centered solutions.
p117
aVI could have easily made it into a projection,
p118
aVor a Google Glass, or something like that.
p119
aVBut I stuck to simple print on the floor.
p120
aVThis print could be taken into hospitals
p121
aVto make them feel much more welcome.
p122
aa(lp123
VWhat I wish to do is make every Parkinson's patient
p124
aVfeel like my uncle felt that day.
p125
aVHe told me that I made him feel like his old self again.
p126
aa(lp127
V"Smart" in today's world has become synonymous to high tech,
p128
aVand the world is only getting smarter and smarter day by day.
p129
aVBut why can't smart be something that's simple and yet effective?
p130
aVAll we need is a little bit of empathy and some curiosity,
p131
aVto go out there, observe.
p132
aVBut let's not stop at that.
p133
aVLet's find these complex problems. Don't be scared of them.
p134
aVBreak them, boil them down into much smaller problems,
p135
aVand then find simple solutions for them.
p136
aVTest these solutions, fail if needed,
p137
aVbut with newer insights to make it better.
p138
aVImagine what we all could do if we all came up with simple solutions.
p139
aVWhat would the world be like if we combined all our simple solutions?
p140
aVLet's make a smarter world, but with simplicity.
p141
aa(lp142
VThank you.

She currently works in the Netherlands as a strategist. Her work entails combining the fuzzy front-end of the design process with emerging technologies to answer the question of what needs to be designed in the future.</p> <p class=\\"p1\\">Even as a child, Mileha had a keen interest in (re)designing things around her, even though she had little knowledge about it as a profession. This led her to take up the Bachelor in Product Design at the MIT School of Design. After graduation, she got a couple of years of work experience in India, where she quickly realized that apart from the actual tangible design, a successful product needs a backbone of thorough research in user needs and market analysis. The need to study this further brought Mileha to Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands to study Strategic Product Design for her Masters.</p>", "slug": "mileha_soneji", "whotheyare": "Mileha Soneji believes that having empathy and being able to put yourself in another person\'s shoes is what makes for great design.", "whatotherssay": "", "id": 2955, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/399fc4a103cd903a8be59693bea8224c944c0867_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "Simple hacks for life with Parkinson\'s", "take_action": [], "comments": 27072, "more_resources": [], "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/77d59ec0a2c75d5a228edc3e0fb8d87fb6e97c99_2880x1620.jpg", "description": "Simple solutions are often best, even when dealing with something as complicated as Parkinson\'s.

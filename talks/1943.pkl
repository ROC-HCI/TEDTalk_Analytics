VSo my moment of truth
p5
aVdid not come all at once.
p6
aVIn 2010, I had the chance to be considered
p7
aVfor promotion from my job
p8
aVas director of policy planning
p9
aVat the U.S. State Department.
p10
aVThis was my moment to lean in,
p11
aVto push myself forward
p12
aVfor what are really only a handful
p13
aVof the very top foreign policy jobs,
p14
aVand I had just finished a big, 18-month project
p15
aVfor Secretary Clinton, successfully,
p16
aVand I knew I could handle a bigger job.
p17
aa(lp18
VThe woman I thought I was
p19
aVwould have said yes.
p20
aVBut I had been commuting for two years
p21
aVbetween Washington and Princeton, New Jersey,
p22
aVwhere my husband and my two teenage sons lived,
p23
aVand it was not going well.
p24
aVI tried on the idea of eking out another two years
p25
aVin Washington, or maybe uprooting my sons
p26
aVfrom their school and my husband from his work
p27
aVand asking them to join me.
p28
aVBut deep down, I knew
p29
aVthat the right decision was to go home,
p30
aVeven if I didn't fully recognize the woman
p31
aVwho was making that choice.
p32
aa(lp33
VThat was a decision based on love
p34
aVand responsibility.
p35
aVI couldn't keep watching my oldest son
p36
aVmake bad choices
p37
aVwithout being able to be there for him
p38
aVwhen and if he needed me.
p39
aVBut the real change came more gradually.
p40
aVOver the next year,
p41
aVwhile my family was righting itself,
p42
aVI started to realize
p43
aVthat even if I could go back into government,
p44
aVI didn't want to.
p45
aVI didn't want to miss the last five years
p46
aVthat my sons were at home.
p47
aVI finally allowed myself to accept
p48
aVwhat was really most important to me,
p49
aVnot what I was conditioned to want
p50
aVor maybe what I conditioned myself to want,
p51
aVand that decision led to a reassessment
p52
aVof the feminist narrative that I grew up with
p53
aVand have always championed.
p54
aa(lp55
VI am still completely committed
p56
aVto the cause of male-female equality,
p57
aVbut let's think about what that equality really means,
p58
aVand how best to achieve it.
p59
aVI always accepted the idea
p60
aVthat the most respected and powerful people
p61
aVin our society are men at the top of their careers,
p62
aVso that the measure of male-female equality
p63
aVought to be how many women are in those positions:
p64
aVprime ministers, presidents, CEOs,
p65
aVdirectors, managers, Nobel laureates, leaders.
p66
aVI still think we should do everything we possibly can
p67
aVto achieve that goal.
p68
aVBut that's only half of real equality,
p69
aVand I now think we're never going to get there
p70
aVunless we recognize the other half.
p71
aVI suggest that real equality,
p72
aVfull equality,
p73
aVdoes not just mean valuing women
p74
aVon male terms.
p75
aVIt means creating a much wider range
p76
aVof equally respected choices
p77
aVfor women and for men.
p78
aVAnd to get there, we have to change our workplaces,
p79
aVour policies and our culture.
p80
aa(lp81
VIn the workplace,
p82
aVreal equality means valuing family
p83
aVjust as much as work,
p84
aVand understanding that the two reinforce each other.
p85
aVAs a leader and as a manager,
p86
aVI have always acted on the mantra,
p87
aVif family comes first,
p88
aVwork does not come second \u2014
p89
aVlife comes together.
p90
aVIf you work for me, and you have a family issue,
p91
aVI expect you to attend to it,
p92
aVand I am confident,
p93
aVand my confidence has always been borne out,
p94
aVthat the work will get done, and done better.
p95
aVWorkers who have a reason to get home
p96
aVto care for their children or their family members
p97
aVare more focused, more efficient,
p98
aVmore results-focused.
p99
aVAnd breadwinners who are also caregivers
p100
aVhave a much wider range
p101
aVof experiences and contacts.
p102
aVThink about a lawyer who spends part of his time
p103
aVat school events for his kids
p104
aVtalking to other parents.
p105
aVHe's much more likely to bring in
p106
aVnew clients for his firm
p107
aVthan a lawyer who never leaves his office.
p108
aVAnd caregiving itself
p109
aVdevelops patience \u2014
p110
aVa lot of patience \u2014
p111
aVand empathy, creativity, resilience, adaptability.
p112
aVThose are all attributes that are ever more important
p113
aVin a high-speed, horizontal,
p114
aVnetworked global economy.
p115
aa(lp116
VThe best companies actually know this.
p117
aVThe companies that win awards
p118
aVfor workplace flexibility in the United States
p119
aVinclude some of our most successful corporations,
p120
aVand a 2008 national study
p121
aVon the changing workforce
p122
aVshowed that employees
p123
aVin flexible and effective workplaces
p124
aVare more engaged with their work,
p125
aVthey're more satisfied and more loyal,
p126
aVthey have lower levels of stress
p127
aVand higher levels of mental health.
p128
aVAnd a 2012 study of employers
p129
aVshowed that deep, flexible practices
p130
aVactually lowered operating costs
p131
aVand increased adaptability
p132
aVin a global service economy.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo you may think
p135
aVthat the privileging of work over family
p136
aVis only an American problem.
p137
aVSadly, though, the obsession with work
p138
aVis no longer a uniquely American disease.
p139
aVTwenty years ago,
p140
aVwhen my family first started going to Italy,
p141
aVwe used to luxuriate in the culture of siesta.
p142
aVSiesta is not just about avoiding the heat of the day.
p143
aVIt's actually just as much
p144
aVabout embracing the warmth of a family lunch.
p145
aVNow, when we go, fewer and fewer businesses
p146
aVclose for siesta,
p147
aVreflecting the advance of global corporations
p148
aVand 24-hour competition.
p149
aVSo making a place for those we love
p150
aVis actually a global imperative.
p151
aa(lp152
VIn policy terms,
p153
aVreal equality means recognizing
p154
aVthat the work that women have traditionally done
p155
aVis just as important
p156
aVas the work that men have traditionally done,
p157
aVno matter who does it.
p158
aVThink about it: Breadwinning and caregiving
p159
aVare equally necessary for human survival.
p160
aVAt least if we get beyond a barter economy,
p161
aVsomebody has to earn an income
p162
aVand someone else has to convert that income
p163
aVto care and sustenance for loved ones.
p164
aa(lp165
VNow most of you, when you hear me
p166
aVtalk about breadwinning and caregiving,
p167
aVinstinctively translate those categories
p168
aVinto men's work and women's work.
p169
aVAnd we don't typically challenge
p170
aVwhy men's work is advantaged.
p171
aVBut consider a same-sex couple
p172
aVlike my friends Sarah and Emily.
p173
aVThey're psychiatrists.
p174
aVThey got married five years ago,
p175
aVand now they have two-year-old twins.
p176
aVThey love being mothers,
p177
aVbut they also love their work,
p178
aVand they're really good at what they do.
p179
aVSo how are they going to divide up
p180
aVbreadwinning and caregiving responsibilities?
p181
aVShould one of them stop working
p182
aVor reduce hours to be home?
p183
aVOr should they both change their practices
p184
aVso they can have much more flexible schedules?
p185
aVAnd what criteria should they use
p186
aVto make that decision?
p187
aVIs it who makes the most money
p188
aVor who is most committed to her career?
p189
aVOr who has the most flexible boss?
p190
aa(lp191
VThe same-sex perspective helps us see
p192
aVthat juggling work and family
p193
aVare not women's problems,
p194
aVthey're family problems.
p195
aVAnd Sarah and Emily are the lucky ones,
p196
aVbecause they have a choice
p197
aVabout how much they want to work.
p198
aVMillions of men and women
p199
aVhave to be both breadwinners and caregivers
p200
aVjust to earn the income they need,
p201
aVand many of those workers are scrambling.
p202
aVThey're patching together care arrangements
p203
aVthat are inadequate
p204
aVand often actually unsafe.
p205
aVIf breadwinning and caregiving are really equal,
p206
aVthen why shouldn't a government
p207
aVinvest as much in an infrastructure of care
p208
aVas the foundation of a healthy society
p209
aVas it invests in physical infrastructure
p210
aVas the backbone of a successful economy?
p211
aa(lp212
VThe governments that get it \u2014
p213
aVno surprises here \u2014
p214
aVthe governments that get it,
p215
aVNorway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands,
p216
aVprovide universal child care,
p217
aVsupport for caregivers at home,
p218
aVschool and early childhood education,
p219
aVprotections for pregnant women,
p220
aVand care for the elderly and the disabled.
p221
aVThose governments invest in that infrastructure
p222
aVthe same way they invest in roads and bridges
p223
aVand tunnels and trains.
p224
aVThose societies also show you
p225
aVthat breadwinning and caregiving
p226
aVreinforce each other.
p227
aVThey routinely rank among the top 15 countries
p228
aVof the most globally competitive economies,
p229
aVbut at the same time,
p230
aVthey rank very high on the OECD Better Life Index.
p231
aVIn fact, they rank higher than other governments,
p232
aVlike my own, the U.S., or Switzerland,
p233
aVthat have higher average levels of income
p234
aVbut lower rankings on work-life balance.
p235
aa(lp236
VSo changing our workplaces
p237
aVand building infrastructures of care
p238
aVwould make a big difference,
p239
aVbut we're not going to get equally valued choices
p240
aVunless we change our culture,
p241
aVand the kind of cultural change required
p242
aVmeans re-socializing men.
p243
aV(Applause)
p244
aVIncreasingly in developed countries,
p245
aVwomen are socialized to believe that our place
p246
aVis no longer only in the home,
p247
aVbut men are actually still where they always were.
p248
aVMen are still socialized to believe
p249
aVthat they have to be breadwinners,
p250
aVthat to derive their self-worth
p251
aVfrom how high they can climb over other men
p252
aVon a career ladder.
p253
aVThe feminist revolution still has a long way to go.
p254
aVIt's certainly not complete.
p255
aVBut 60 years after
p256
aV"The Feminine Mystique" was published,
p257
aVmany women actually have
p258
aVmore choices than men do.
p259
aVWe can decide to be a breadwinner,
p260
aVa caregiver, or any combination of the two.
p261
aVWhen a man, on the other hand,
p262
aVdecides to be a caregiver,
p263
aVhe puts his manhood on the line.
p264
aVHis friends may praise his decision,
p265
aVbut underneath, they're scratching their heads.
p266
aVIsn't the measure of a man
p267
aVhis willingness to compete with other men
p268
aVfor power and prestige?
p269
aVAnd as many women hold that view as men do.
p270
aVWe know that lots of women
p271
aVstill judge the attractiveness of a man
p272
aVbased in large part on how successful he is
p273
aVin his career.
p274
aVA woman can drop out of the work force
p275
aVand still be an attractive partner.
p276
aVFor a man, that's a risky proposition.
p277
aVSo as parents and partners,
p278
aVwe should be socializing our sons
p279
aVand our husbands
p280
aVto be whatever they want to be,
p281
aVeither caregivers or breadwinners.
p282
aVWe should be socializing them to make caregiving
p283
aVcool for guys.
p284
aV(Applause)
p285
aa(lp286
VI can almost hear lots of you thinking, "No way."
p287
aVBut in fact, the change is  actually already happening.
p288
aVAt least in the United States,
p289
aVlots of men take pride in cooking,
p290
aVand frankly obsess over stoves.
p291
aVThey are in the birthing rooms.
p292
aVThey take paternity leave when they can.
p293
aVThey can walk a baby or soothe a toddler
p294
aVjust as well as their wives can,
p295
aVand they are increasingly
p296
aVdoing much more of the housework.
p297
aVIndeed, there are male college students now
p298
aVwho are starting to say,
p299
aV"I want to be a stay-at-home dad."
p300
aVThat was completely unthinkable
p301
aV50 or even 30 years ago.
p302
aVAnd in Norway, where men have
p303
aVan automatic three month's paternity leave,
p304
aVbut they lose it if they decide not to take it,
p305
aVa high government official told me
p306
aVthat companies are starting to look
p307
aVat prospective male employees
p308
aVand raise an eyebrow if they didn't in fact
p309
aVtake their leave when they had kids.
p310
aVThat means that it's starting to seem
p311
aVlike a character defect
p312
aVnot to want to be a fully engaged father.
p313
aa(lp314
VSo I was raised
p315
aVto believe that championing women's rights
p316
aVmeant doing everything we could
p317
aVto get women to the top.
p318
aVAnd I still hope that I live long enough
p319
aVto see men and women equally represented
p320
aVat all levels of the work force.
p321
aVBut I've come to believe that we have to value family
p322
aVevery bit as much as we value work,
p323
aVand that we should entertain the idea
p324
aVthat doing right by those we love
p325
aVwill make all of us better at everything we do.
p326
aa(lp327
VThirty years ago, Carol Gilligan,
p328
aVa wonderful psychologist, studied adolescent girls
p329
aVand identified an ethic of care,
p330
aVan element of human nature every bit as important
p331
aVas the ethic of justice.
p332
aVIt turns out that "you don't care"
p333
aVis just as much a part of who we are
p334
aVas "that's not fair."
p335
aVBill Gates agrees.
p336
aVHe argues that the two great forces of human nature
p337
aVare self-interest and caring for others.
p338
aVLet's bring them both together.
p339
aVLet's make the feminist revolution
p340
aVa humanist revolution.
p341
aVAs whole human beings,
p342
aVwe will be better caregivers and breadwinners.
p343
aVYou may think that can't happen,
p344
aVbut I grew up in a society
p345
aVwhere my mother put out small vases
p346
aVof cigarettes for dinner parties,
p347
aVwhere blacks and whites used separate bathrooms,
p348
aVand where everybody claimed to be heterosexual.
p349
aVToday, not so much.
p350
aVThe revolution for human equality
p351
aVcan happen.
p352
aVIt is happening.
p353
aVIt will happen.
p354
aVHow far and how fast is up to us.
p355
aa(lp356
VThank you.

Slaughter has served as the Dean of Princeton&rsquo;s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, and was the first female Director of Policy Planning for the US Department of State.

And she is on the record saying that integrating her remarkably high-powered career and motherhood was doable when she had the flexibility to control her own schedule, but impossible once she was no longer her own boss. </p>  <p>In <a href=\\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/07/why-women-still-cant-have-it-all/309020/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">a 2012 article</a> for the <em>Atlantic </em>that became the magazine&rsquo;s most-read ever,&nbsp;Slaughter dismantles the recently-popularized notion that women who fail to &ldquo;have it all&rdquo; lack the ambition to do so. Instead, she argues that the way most top jobs are structured, including the expectations of workers regardless of gender, uphold slavish devotion to work above family life or other passions. Creating a more flexible work environment would benefit not just individual women and men, but society as a whole. It is unacceptable, she argues, that a desire to spend time with one&rsquo;s family should be cause for shame. </p>", "slug": "anne_marie_slaughter", "whotheyare": "Anne-Marie Slaughter has exploded the conversation around women\\u2019s work-life balance.", "whatotherssay": "Why should we want leaders who fall short on personal responsibilities?

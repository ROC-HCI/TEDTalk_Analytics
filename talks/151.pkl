VWell, first of all, let me thank Emeka \u2014 as a matter of fact,
p5
aVTED Global \u2014 for putting this conference together.
p6
aVThis conference is going to rank as the most important
p7
aVin the beginning of the 21st century.
p8
aVThink African governments will put together a conference like this?
p9
aVYou think the A.U. will put together a conference like this?
p10
aVEven before they do that they will ask for foreign aid.
p11
aVI would also like to pay homage and honor to the TED Fellows
p12
aVJune Arunga, James Shikwati, Andrew, and the other TED Fellows.
p13
aVI call them the Cheetah Generation.
p14
aVThe Cheetah Generation is a new breed of Africans
p15
aVwho brook no nonsense about corruption.
p16
aVThey understand what accountability and democracy is.
p17
aVThey're not going to wait for government to do things for them.
p18
aVThat's the Cheetah Generation,
p19
aVand Africa's salvation rests on the backs of these Cheetahs.
p20
aVIn contrast, of course, we have the Hippo Generation.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VThe Hippo Generation are the ruling elites.
p25
aVThey are stuck in their intellectual patch.
p26
aVComplaining about colonialism and imperialism,
p27
aVthey wouldn't move one foot.
p28
aVIf you ask them to reform the economies,
p29
aVthey're not going to reform it
p30
aVbecause they benefit from the rotten status quo.
p31
aVNow, there are a lot of Africans who are very angry,
p32
aVangry at the condition of Africa.
p33
aVNow, we're talking about a continent that is not poor.
p34
aVIt is rich in mineral resources, natural mineral resources.
p35
aVBut the mineral wealth of Africa is not being utilized
p36
aVto lift its people out of poverty.
p37
aVThat's what makes a lot of Africans very angry.
p38
aVAnd in a way, Africa is more than a tragedy, in more ways than one.
p39
aVThere's another enduring tragedy, and that tragedy is that
p40
aVthere are so many people, so many governments,
p41
aVso many organizations who want to help the people in Africa.
p42
aVThey don't understand.
p43
aVNow, we're not saying don't help Africa.
p44
aVHelping Africa is noble.
p45
aVBut helping Africa has been turned into a theater of the absurd.
p46
aVIt's like the blind leading the clueless.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VThere are certain things that we need to recognize.
p51
aVAfrica's begging-bowl leaks.
p52
aVDid you know that 40 percent of the wealth created in Africa
p53
aVis not invested here in Africa?
p54
aVIt's taken out of Africa.
p55
aVThat's what the World Bank says.
p56
aVLook at Africa's begging-bowl.
p57
aVIt leaks horribly.
p58
aVThere are people who think that we should pour more money,
p59
aVmore aid into this bowl which leaks.
p60
aVWhat are the leakages?
p61
aVCorruption alone costs Africa 148 billion dollars a year.
p62
aVYes, put that aside.
p63
aVCapital flight out of Africa, 80 billion a year.
p64
aVPut that aside.
p65
aVLet's take food imports.
p66
aVEvery year Africa spends 20 billion dollars to import food.
p67
aVJust add that up, all these leakages.
p68
aVThat's far more than the 50 billion Tony Blair wants to raise for Africa.
p69
aVNow, back in the 1960s Africa not only fed itself,
p70
aVit also exported food.
p71
aVNot anymore.
p72
aa(lp73
VWe know that something has gone fundamentally wrong.
p74
aVYou know it, I know it, but let's not waste our time
p75
aVtalking about these mistakes because we'll spend all day here.
p76
aVLet's move on, and flip over to the next chapter,
p77
aVand that's what this conference is all about \u2014 the next chapter.
p78
aVThe next chapter begins with first of all, asking ourselves
p79
aVthis fundamental question,
p80
aV"Whom do we want to help in Africa?"
p81
aVThere is the people, and then there is the government or leaders.
p82
aVNow, the previous speaker before me,
p83
aVIdris Mohammed, indicated that
p84
aVwe've had abysmal leadership in Africa.
p85
aVThat characterization, in my view, is even more charitable.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VI belong to an Internet discussion forum,
p90
aVan African Internet discussion forum,
p91
aVand I asked them, I said, "Since 1960, we've had exactly
p92
aV204 African heads of state, since 1960."
p93
aVAnd I asked them to name me just 20 good leaders,
p94
aVjust 20 good leaders \u2014
p95
aVyou may want to take this leadership challenge yourself.
p96
aVI asked them to name me just 20.
p97
aVEverybody mentioned Nelson Mandela, of course.
p98
aVKwame Nkrumah, Nyerere, Kenyatta \u2014 somebody mentioned Idi Amin.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VI let that pass.
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VMy point is, they couldn't go beyond 15.
p107
aVEven if they had been able to name me 20,
p108
aVwhat does that tell you?
p109
aV20 out of 204 means that the vast majority
p110
aVof the African leaders failed their people.
p111
aVAnd if you look at them, the slate of the post-colonial leaders \u2014
p112
aVan assortment of military fufu heads,
p113
aVSwiss-bank socialists, crocodile liberators, vampire elites,
p114
aVquack revolutionaries.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Applause)
p117
aa(lp118
VNow, this leadership is a far cry from the traditional leaders
p119
aVthat Africans have known for centuries.
p120
aVThe second false premise that we make
p121
aVwhen we're trying to help Africa
p122
aVis that sometimes we think that there is something called
p123
aVa government in Africa that cares about its people,
p124
aVserves the interests of the people, and represents the people.
p125
aVThere is one particular quote \u2014 a Lesotho chief once said
p126
aVthat "Here in Lesotho, we've got two problems:
p127
aVrats and the government."
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VWhat you and I understand as a government
p132
aVdoesn't exist in many African countries.
p133
aVIn fact, what we call our governments are vampire states.
p134
aVVampires because they suck
p135
aVthe economic vitality out of their people.
p136
aVGovernment is the problem in Africa.
p137
aVA vampire state is the government \u2014
p138
aV(Applause)
p139
aV\u2014 which has been hijacked by a phalanx of bandits and crooks
p140
aVwho use the instruments of state power to enrich themselves,
p141
aVtheir cronies, and tribesmen and exclude everybody else.
p142
aVThe richest people in Africa are heads-of-state and ministers,
p143
aVand quite often the chief bandit is the head-of-state himself.
p144
aVWhere do they get their money?
p145
aVBy creating wealth?
p146
aVNo.
p147
aVBy raking it off the backs of their suffering people.
p148
aVThat's not wealth creation. It's wealth redistribution.
p149
aa(lp150
VThe third fundamental issue that we have to recognize
p151
aVis that if we want to help the African people,
p152
aVwe must know where the African people are.
p153
aVTake any African economy.
p154
aVAn African economy can be broken up into three sectors.
p155
aVThere is the modern sector, there is the informal sector
p156
aVand the traditional sector.
p157
aVThe modern sector is the abode of the elites.
p158
aVIt's the seat of government.
p159
aVIn many African countries the modern sector is lost.
p160
aVIt's dysfunctional.
p161
aVIt is a meretricious fandango of imported systems,
p162
aVwhich the elites themselves don't understand.
p163
aVThat is the source of many of Africa's problems
p164
aVwhere the struggles for political power emanate
p165
aVand then spill over onto the informal and the traditional sector,
p166
aVclaiming innocent lives.
p167
aa(lp168
VNow the modern sector, of course,
p169
aVis where a lot of the development aid and resources went into.
p170
aVMore than 80 percent of Ivory Coast's development
p171
aVwent into the modern sector.
p172
aVThe other sectors, the informal and the traditional sectors,
p173
aVare where you find the majority of the African people,
p174
aVthe real people in Africa. That's where you find them.
p175
aVNow, obviously it makes common sense
p176
aVthat if you want to help the people, you go where the people are.
p177
aVBut that's not what we did.
p178
aVAs a matter of fact,
p179
aVwe neglected the informal and the traditional sectors.
p180
aVNow, traditional sector is where Africa produces its agriculture,
p181
aVwhich is one of the reasons why Africa can't feed itself,
p182
aVand that's why it must import food.
p183
aa(lp184
VAll right, you cannot develop Africa by ignoring
p185
aVthe informal and the traditional sectors.
p186
aVAnd you can't develop the informal and the traditional sectors
p187
aVwithout an operational understanding of how these two sectors work.
p188
aVThese two sectors, let me describe to you,
p189
aVhave their own indigenous institutions.
p190
aVFirst one is the political system.
p191
aVTraditionally, Africans hate governments. They hate tyranny.
p192
aVIf you look into their traditional systems,
p193
aVAfricans organize their states in two types.
p194
aVThe first one belongs to those ethnic societies
p195
aVwho believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous,
p196
aVso they didn't want to have anything to do
p197
aVwith any centralized authority.
p198
aVThese societies are the Ibo, the Somali, the Kikuyus,
p199
aVfor example. They have no chiefs.
p200
aa(lp201
VThe other ethnic groups, which did have chiefs,
p202
aVmade sure that they surrounded the chiefs
p203
aVwith councils upon councils upon councils
p204
aVto prevent them from abusing their power.
p205
aVIn Ashanti tradition, for example,
p206
aVthe chief cannot make any decision
p207
aVwithout the concurrence of the council of elders.
p208
aVWithout the council the chief can't pass any law,
p209
aVand if the chief doesn't govern according to the will of the people
p210
aVhe will be removed.
p211
aVIf not, the people will abandon the chief,
p212
aVgo somewhere else and set up a new settlement.
p213
aVAnd even if you look in ancient African empires,
p214
aVthey were all organized around one particular principle \u2014
p215
aVthe confederacy principle,
p216
aVwhich is characterized by a great deal of devolution of authority,
p217
aVdecentralization of power.
p218
aa(lp219
VNow, this is what I have described to you.
p220
aVThis is part of Africa's indigenous political heritage.
p221
aVNow, compare that to the modern systems
p222
aVthe ruling elites established on Africa.
p223
aVIt is a total far cry.
p224
aVIn the economic system in traditional Africa,
p225
aVthe means of production is privately owned.
p226
aVIt's owned by extended families.
p227
aVYou see, in the West, the basic economic and social unit
p228
aVis the individual.
p229
aVThe American will say, "I am because I am,
p230
aVand I can damn well do anything I want, anytime."
p231
aVThe accent is on the "I."
p232
aVIn Africa, the Africans say, "I am, because we are."
p233
aVThe "we" connotes community \u2014 the extended family system.
p234
aVThe extended family system pools its resources together.
p235
aa(lp236
VThey own farms. They decide what to do, what to produce.
p237
aVThey don't take any orders from their chiefs.
p238
aVThey decide what to do.
p239
aVAnd when they produce their crops, they sell the surplus
p240
aVon marketplaces.
p241
aVWhen they make a profit it is theirs to keep,
p242
aVnot for the chief to sequester it from them.
p243
aVSo, in a nutshell, what we had in traditional Africa
p244
aVwas a free-market system.
p245
aVThere were markets in Africa
p246
aVbefore the colonialists stepped foot on the continent.
p247
aVTimbuktu was one great big market town.
p248
aVKano, Salaga \u2014 they were all there.
p249
aVEven if you go to West Africa, you notice that market activity
p250
aVin West Africa has always been dominated by women.
p251
aVSo, it's quite appropriate that this section is called
p252
aVa marketplace.
p253
aVThe market is not alien to Africa.
p254
aa(lp255
VWhat Africans practiced was a different form of capitalism,
p256
aVbut then after independence, all of a sudden,
p257
aVmarkets, capitalism became a western institution,
p258
aVand the leaders said Africans were ready for socialism.
p259
aVNonsense.
p260
aVAnd even then, what kind of socialism did they practice?
p261
aVThe socialism that they practiced was a peculiar form of
p262
aVSwiss-bank socialism,
p263
aVwhich allowed the heads of states and the ministers
p264
aVto rape and plunder Africa's
p265
aVtreasuries for deposit in Switzerland.
p266
aVThat is not the kind of system Africans had known for centuries.
p267
aVWhat do we do now?
p268
aVGo back to Africa's indigenous institutions,
p269
aVand this is where we charge the Cheetahs to go into the informal sectors,
p270
aVthe traditional sectors.
p271
aVThat's where you find the African people.
p272
aa(lp273
VAnd I'd like to show you a quick little video
p274
aVabout the informal sector, about the boat-building
p275
aVthat I, myself, tried to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora
p276
aVto invest in.
p277
aVCould you please show that?
p278
aVThe men are going fishing in these small boats.
p279
aVYes, it's an enterprise.
p280
aVThis is by a local Ghanaian entrepreneur, using his own capital.
p281
aVHe's getting no assistance from the government,
p282
aVand he's building a second, bigger boat.
p283
aVA bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed.
p284
aVIt means that he will be able to employ more Ghanaians.
p285
aVIt also means that he will be able to generate wealth.
p286
aVAnd then it will have what economists call
p287
aVexternal effects on a local economy.
p288
aVAll that you need to do, all that the elites need to do,
p289
aVis to move this operation into something that is enclosed
p290
aVso that the operation can be made more efficient.
p291
aa(lp292
VNow, it is not just this informal sector.
p293
aVThere is also traditional medicine.
p294
aV80 percent of Africans still rely on traditional medicine.
p295
aVThe modern healthcare sector has totally collapsed.
p296
aVNow, this is an area \u2014 I mean, there is a treasure trove of wealth
p297
aVin the traditional medicine area.
p298
aVThis is where we need to mobilize Africans,
p299
aVin the Diaspora especially, to invest in this.
p300
aVWe also need to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora,
p301
aVnot only to go into the traditional sectors,
p302
aVbut to go into agriculture and also to instigate change from within.
p303
aVWe were able to mobilize Ghanaians in the Diaspora
p304
aVto instigate change in Ghana and bring about democracy in Ghana.
p305
aVAnd I know that with the Cheetahs, we can take Africa back
p306
aVone village at a time.
p307
aVThank you very much.

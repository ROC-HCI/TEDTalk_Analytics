VI want you to imagine two couples in the middle of 1979
p5
aVon the exact same day, at the exact same moment,
p6
aVeach conceiving a baby, OK?
p7
aVSo two couples each conceiving one baby.
p8
aVNow I don't want you to spend too much time imagining the conception,
p9
aVbecause if you do, you're not going to listen to me,
p10
aVso just imagine that for a moment.
p11
aVAnd in this scenario, I want to imagine that, in one case,
p12
aVthe sperm is carrying a Y chromosome,
p13
aVmeeting that X chromosome of the egg.
p14
aVAnd in the other case, the sperm is carrying an X chromosome,
p15
aVmeeting the X chromosome of the egg.
p16
aVBoth are viable; both take off.
p17
aVWe'll come back to these people later.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo I wear two hats in most of what I do.
p20
aVAs the one hat, I do history of anatomy.
p21
aVI'm a historian by training, and what I study in that case
p22
aVis the way that people have dealt with anatomy \u2014
p23
aVmeaning human bodies, animal bodies \u2014
p24
aVhow they dealt with bodily fluids, concepts of bodies;
p25
aVhow have they thought about bodies.
p26
aVThe other hat that I've worn in my work is as an activist,
p27
aVas a patient advocate \u2014
p28
aVor, as I sometimes say, as an impatient advocate \u2014
p29
aVfor people who are patients of doctors.
p30
aVIn that case, what I've worked with is people who have body types
p31
aVthat challenge social norms.
p32
aVSo some of what I've worked on, for example,
p33
aVis people who are conjoined twins \u2014
p34
aVtwo people within one body.
p35
aVSome of what I've worked on is people who have dwarfism \u2014
p36
aVso people who are much shorter than typical.
p37
aVAnd a lot of what I've worked on is people who have atypical sex \u2014
p38
aVso people who don't have the standard male or the standard female body types.
p39
aVAnd as a general term, we can use the term "intersex" for this.
p40
aa(lp41
VIntersex comes in a lot of different forms.
p42
aVI'll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex
p43
aVthat isn't standard for male or female.
p44
aVSo in one instance,
p45
aVyou can have somebody who has an XY chromosomal basis,
p46
aVand that SRY gene on the Y chromosome
p47
aVtells the proto-gonads, which we all have in the fetal life,
p48
aVto become testes.
p49
aVSo in the fetal life, those testes are pumping out testosterone.
p50
aVBut because this individual lacks receptors to hear that testosterone,
p51
aVthe body doesn't react to the testosterone.
p52
aVAnd this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
p53
aVSo lots of levels of testosterone, but no reaction to it.
p54
aVAs a consequence, the body develops more along the female typical path.
p55
aVWhen the child is born, she looks like a girl.
p56
aVShe is a girl, she is raised as a girl.
p57
aVAnd it's often not until she hits puberty and she's growing and developing breasts,
p58
aVbut she's not getting her period,
p59
aVthat somebody figures out something's up here.
p60
aVAnd they do some tests and figure out
p61
aVthat, instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus,
p62
aVshe has testes inside, and she has a Y chromosome.
p63
aa(lp64
VNow what's important to understand
p65
aVis you may think of this person as really being male,
p66
aVbut they're really not.
p67
aVFemales, like males,
p68
aVhave in our bodies something called the adrenal glands.
p69
aVThey're in the back of our body.
p70
aVAnd the adrenal glands make androgens, which are a masculinizing hormone.
p71
aVMost females like me \u2014 I believe myself to be a typical female \u2014
p72
aVI don't actually know my chromosomal make-up,
p73
aVbut I think I'm probably typical \u2014
p74
aVmost females like me are actually androgen-sensitive.
p75
aVWe're making androgen, and we're responding to androgens.
p76
aVThe consequence is that somebody like me
p77
aVhas actually had a brain exposed to more androgens
p78
aVthan the woman born with testes who has androgen insensitivity syndrome.
p79
aVSo sex is really complicated \u2014
p80
aVit's not just that intersex people
p81
aVare in the middle of all the sex spectrum \u2014
p82
aVin some ways, they can be all over the place.
p83
aa(lp84
VAnother example:
p85
aVa few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old,
p86
aVwho was born a boy, raised a boy,
p87
aVhad a girlfriend, had sex with his girlfriend,
p88
aVhad a life as a guy,
p89
aVand had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside.
p90
aVWhat he had was an extreme form
p91
aVof a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
p92
aVHe had XX chromosomes,
p93
aVand in the womb, his adrenal glands were in such high gear
p94
aVthat it created, essentially, a masculine hormonal environment.
p95
aVAnd as a consequence, his genitals were masculinized,
p96
aVhis brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones.
p97
aVAnd he was born looking like a boy \u2014 nobody suspected anything.
p98
aVAnd it was only when he had reached the age of 19
p99
aVthat he began to have enough medical problems from menstruating internally,
p100
aVthat doctors figured out that, in fact, he was female, internally.
p101
aa(lp102
VOK, so just one more quick example of a way you can have intersex.
p103
aVSome people who have XX chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis,
p104
aVwhich is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular tissue wrapped around it.
p105
aVAnd we're not exactly sure why that happens.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo sex can come in lots of different varieties.
p108
aVThe reason that children with these kinds of bodies \u2014
p109
aVwhether it's dwarfism, or it's conjoined twinning,
p110
aVor it's an intersex type \u2014
p111
aVare often "normalized" by surgeons
p112
aVis not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health.
p113
aVIn many cases, people are actually perfectly healthy.
p114
aVThe reason they're often subject to various kinds of surgeries
p115
aVis because they threaten our social categories.
p116
aVOur system has been based typically on the idea
p117
aVthat a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity.
p118
aVSo we have the concept that what it means to be a woman
p119
aVis to have a female identity;
p120
aVwhat it means to be a black person is, allegedly, to have an African anatomy
p121
aVin terms of your history.
p122
aVAnd so we have this terribly simplistic idea.
p123
aVAnd when we're faced with a body
p124
aVthat actually presents us something quite different,
p125
aVit startles us in terms of those categorizations.
p126
aa(lp127
VSo we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism.
p128
aVAnd our nation's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism.
p129
aVYou can imagine how startling then it is
p130
aVwhen you have children who are born who are two people inside of one body.
p131
aVWhere I ran into the most heat from this most recently
p132
aVwas last year when South African runner, Caster Semenya,
p133
aVhad her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin.
p134
aVI had a lot of journalists calling me, asking me,
p135
aV"Which is the test they're going to run
p136
aVthat will tell us whether or not Caster Semenya is male or female?"
p137
aVAnd I had to explain to the journalists there isn't such a test.
p138
aa(lp139
VIn fact, we now know that sex is complicated enough
p140
aVthat we have to admit:
p141
aVNature doesn't draw the line for us between male and female,
p142
aVor between male and intersex and female and intersex;
p143
aVwe actually draw that line on nature.
p144
aVSo what we have is a sort of situation where the farther our science goes,
p145
aVthe more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories
p146
aVthat we thought of as stable anatomical categories,
p147
aVthat mapped very simply to stable identity categories
p148
aVare a lot more fuzzy than we thought.
p149
aVAnd it's not just in terms of sex.
p150
aVIt's also in terms of race,
p151
aVwhich turns out to be vastly more complicated
p152
aVthan our terminology has allowed.
p153
aa(lp154
VAs we look, we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas.
p155
aVWe look, for example, about the fact
p156
aVthat we share at least 95 percent of our DNA with chimpanzees.
p157
aVWhat are we to make of the fact
p158
aVthat we differ from them only, really, by a few nucleotides?
p159
aVAnd as we get farther and farther with our science,
p160
aVwe get more and more into a discomforted zone,
p161
aVwhere we have to acknowledge that the simplistic categories we've had
p162
aVare probably overly simplistic.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo we're seeing this in all sorts of places in human life.
p165
aVOne of the places we're seeing it, for example,
p166
aVin our culture, in the United States today,
p167
aVis battles over the beginning of life and the end of life.
p168
aVWe have difficult conversations
p169
aVabout at what point we decide a body becomes a human,
p170
aVsuch that it has a different right than a fetal life.
p171
aVWe have very difficult conversations nowadays \u2014
p172
aVprobably not out in the open as much as within medicine \u2014
p173
aVabout the question of when somebody's dead.
p174
aVIn the past, our ancestors never had to struggle so much
p175
aVwith this question of when somebody was dead.
p176
aVAt most, they'd stick a feather on somebody's nose,
p177
aVand if it twitched, they didn't bury them yet.
p178
aVIf it stopped twitching, you bury them.
p179
aVBut today, we have a situation
p180
aVwhere we want to take vital organs out of beings
p181
aVand give them to other beings.
p182
aVAnd as a consequence,
p183
aVwe have to struggle with this really difficult question
p184
aVabout who's dead,
p185
aVand this leads us to a really difficult situation
p186
aVwhere we don't have such simple categories as we've had before.
p187
aa(lp188
VNow you might think that all this breaking-down of categories
p189
aVwould make somebody like me really happy.
p190
aVI'm a political progressive, I defend people with unusual bodies,
p191
aVbut I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous.
p192
aVUnderstanding that these categories
p193
aVare really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense.
p194
aVIt makes me tense from the point of view of thinking about democracy.
p195
aVSo in order to tell you about that tension,
p196
aVI have to first admit to you a huge fan of the Founding Fathers.
p197
aVI know they were racists, I know they were sexist,
p198
aVbut they were great.
p199
aVI mean, they were so brave and so bold and so radical in what they did,
p200
aVthat I find myself watching that cheesy musical "1776" every few years,
p201
aVand it's not because of the music, which is totally forgettable.
p202
aVIt's because of what happened in 1776 with the Founding Fathers.
p203
aa(lp204
VThe Founding Fathers were, for my point of view,
p205
aVthe original anatomical activists,
p206
aVand this is why.
p207
aVWhat they rejected was an anatomical concept
p208
aVand replaced it with another one
p209
aVthat was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years.
p210
aVSo as you all recall,
p211
aVwhat our Founding Fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy,
p212
aVand the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
p213
aVThe monarchs of the old world didn't have a concept of DNA,
p214
aVbut they did have a concept of birthright.
p215
aVThey had a concept of blue blood.
p216
aVThey had the idea that the people who would be in political power
p217
aVshould be in political power because of the blood being passed down
p218
aVfrom grandfather to father to son and so forth.
p219
aVThe Founding Fathers rejected that idea,
p220
aVand they replaced it with a new anatomical concept,
p221
aVand that concept was "all men are created equal."
p222
aVThey leveled that playing field and decided the anatomy that mattered
p223
aVwas the commonality of anatomy, not the difference in anatomy,
p224
aVand that was a really radical thing to do.
p225
aa(lp226
VNow they were doing it in part
p227
aVbecause they were part of an Enlightenment system
p228
aVwhere two things were growing up together.
p229
aVAnd that was democracy growing up,
p230
aVbut it was also science growing up at the same time.
p231
aVAnd it's really clear, if you look at the history of the Founding Fathers,
p232
aVa lot of them were very interested in science,
p233
aVand they were interested in the concept of a naturalistic world.
p234
aVThey were moving away from supernatural explanations,
p235
aVand they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power,
p236
aVwhere it transmitted because of a very vague concept of birthright.
p237
aa(lp238
VThey were moving towards a naturalistic concept.
p239
aVAnd if you look, for example, in the Declaration of Independence,
p240
aVthey talk about nature and nature's God.
p241
aVThey don't talk about God and God's nature.
p242
aVThey're talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
p243
aVSo as part of that, they were coming to us with a concept
p244
aVthat was about anatomical commonality.
p245
aVAnd in doing so, they were really setting up in a beautiful way
p246
aVthe Civil Rights Movement of the future.
p247
aVThey didn't think of it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo what happened years afterwards?
p250
aVWhat happened was women, for example, who wanted the right to vote,
p251
aVtook the Founding Fathers' concept of anatomical commonality
p252
aVbeing more important than anatomical difference
p253
aVand said, "The fact that we have a uterus and ovaries
p254
aVis not significant enough in terms of a difference
p255
aVto mean that we shouldn't have the right to vote,
p256
aVthe right to full citizenship, the right to own property, etc."
p257
aVAnd women successfully argued that.
p258
aVNext came the successful Civil Rights Movement,
p259
aVwhere we found people like Sojourner Truth
p260
aVtalking about, "Ain't I a woman?"
p261
aVWe find men on the marching lines of the Civil Rights Movement
p262
aVsaying, "I am a man."
p263
aVAgain, people of color appealing to a commonality of anatomy
p264
aVover a difference of anatomy, again, successfully.
p265
aVWe see the same thing with the disability rights movement.
p266
aa(lp267
VThe problem is, of course,
p268
aVthat, as we begin to look at all that commonality,
p269
aVwe have to begin to question why we maintain certain divisions.
p270
aVMind you, I want to maintain some divisions,
p271
aVanatomically, in our culture.
p272
aVFor example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
p273
aVI don't want to say we give up entirely on anatomy.
p274
aVI don't want to say a five-year-old
p275
aVshould be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry.
p276
aVSo there are some anatomical divisions
p277
aVthat make sense to me and that I think we should retain.
p278
aVBut the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are
p279
aVand why do we retain them, and do they have meaning.
p280
aa(lp281
VSo let's go back to those two beings conceived at the beginning of this talk.
p282
aVWe have two beings, both conceived
p283
aVin the middle of 1979 on the exact same day.
p284
aVLet's imagine one of them, Mary, is born three months prematurely,
p285
aVso she's born on June 1, 1980.
p286
aVHenry, by contrast, is born at term, so he's born on March 1, 1980.
p287
aVSimply by virtue of the fact
p288
aVthat Mary was born prematurely three months,
p289
aVshe comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than Henry does \u2014
p290
aVthe right to consent to sex, the right to vote, the right to drink.
p291
aVHenry has to wait for all of that,
p292
aVnot because he's actually any different in age, biologically,
p293
aVexcept in terms of when he was born.
p294
aa(lp295
VWe find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are.
p296
aVHenry, by virtue of being assumed to be male \u2014
p297
aValthough I haven't told you that he's the XY one \u2014
p298
aVby virtue of being assumed to be male is now liable to be drafted,
p299
aVwhich Mary does not need to worry about.
p300
aVMary, meanwhile, cannot in all the states have the same right
p301
aVthat Henry has in all the states,
p302
aVnamely, the right to marry.
p303
aVHenry can marry, in every state, a woman,
p304
aVbut Mary can only marry today in a few states, a woman.
p305
aa(lp306
VSo we have these anatomical categories that persist,
p307
aVthat are in many ways problematic and questionable.
p308
aVAnd the question to me becomes:
p309
aVWhat do we do, as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy,
p310
aVthat we reach the point where we have to admit
p311
aVthat a democracy that's been based on anatomy
p312
aVmight start falling apart?
p313
aVI don't want to give up the science, but at the same time,
p314
aVit feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us.
p315
aVSo where do we go?
p316
aVIt seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude:
p317
aV"We have to draw the line somewhere, so we will draw the line somewhere."
p318
aVBut a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position.
p319
aa(lp320
VSo for example, Texas has at one point decided that what it means to marry a man
p321
aVis to mean that you don't have a Y chromosome,
p322
aVand what it means to marry a woman means you have a Y chromosome.
p323
aVIn practice they don't test people for their chromosomes.
p324
aVBut this is also very bizarre,
p325
aVbecause of the story I told you at the beginning
p326
aVabout androgen insensitivity syndrome.
p327
aa(lp328
VIf we look at one of the Founding Fathers of modern democracy,
p329
aVDr. Martin Luther King,
p330
aVhe offers us something of a solution in his "I have a dream" speech.
p331
aVHe says we should judge people "based not on the color of their skin,
p332
aVbut on the content of their character,"
p333
aVmoving beyond anatomy.
p334
aVAnd I want to say, "Yeah, that sounds like a really good idea."
p335
aVBut in practice, how do you do it?
p336
aVHow do you judge people based on the content of character?
p337
aVI also want to point out
p338
aVthat I'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans,
p339
aVbecause, I have to admit, that there are some golden retrievers I know
p340
aVthat are probably more deserving of social services than some humans I know.
p341
aVI also want to say there are probably also some yellow Labradors that I know
p342
aVthat are more capable of informed, intelligent, mature decisions
p343
aVabout sexual relations than some 40-year-olds that I know.
p344
aa(lp345
VSo how do we operationalize the question of content of character?
p346
aVIt turns out to be really difficult.
p347
aVAnd part of me also wonders,
p348
aVwhat if content of character
p349
aVturns out to be something that's scannable in the future \u2014
p350
aVable to be seen with an fMRI?
p351
aVDo we really want to go there?
p352
aVI'm not sure where we go.
p353
aa(lp354
VWhat I do know is that it seems to be really important
p355
aVto think about the idea of the United States being in the lead
p356
aVof thinking about this issue of democracy.
p357
aVWe've done a really good job struggling with democracy,
p358
aVand I think we would do a good job in the future.
p359
aVWe don't have a situation that Iran has, for example,
p360
aVwhere a man who's sexually attracted to other men
p361
aVis liable to be murdered,
p362
aVunless he's willing to submit to a sex change,
p363
aVin which case he's allowed to live.
p364
aa(lp365
VWe don't have that kind of situation.
p366
aVI'm glad to say we don't have the kind of situation with \u2014
p367
aVa surgeon I talked to a few years ago
p368
aVwho had brought over a set of conjoined twins
p369
aVin order to separate them, partly to make a name for himself.
p370
aVBut when I was on the phone with him, asking why he'll do this surgery \u2014
p371
aVthis was a very high-risk surgery \u2014 his answer was that, in this other nation,
p372
aVthese children were going to be treated very badly, and so he had to do this.
p373
aVMy response to him was, "Well, have you considered political asylum
p374
aVinstead of a separation surgery?"
p375
aVThe United States has offered tremendous possibility
p376
aVfor allowing people to be the way they are,
p377
aVwithout having them have to be changed for the sake of the state.
p378
aVSo I think we have to be in the lead.
p379
aa(lp380
VWell, just to close, I want to suggest to you
p381
aVthat I've been talking a lot about the Fathers.
p382
aVAnd I want to think about the possibilities
p383
aVof what democracy might look like, or might have looked like,
p384
aVif we had more involved the mothers.
p385
aVAnd I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist,
p386
aVand that is that I think that there may be different kinds of insights
p387
aVthat can come from different kinds of anatomies,
p388
aVparticularly when we have people thinking in groups.
p389
aVFor years, because I've been interested in intersex,
p390
aVI've also been interested in sex-difference research.
p391
aVAnd one of the things that I've been interested in
p392
aVis looking at the differences between males and females
p393
aVin terms of the way they think and operate in the world.
p394
aVAnd what we know from cross-cultural studies
p395
aVis that females, on average \u2014
p396
aVnot everyone, but on average \u2014
p397
aVare more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations
p398
aVand to taking care of people
p399
aVwho are, basically, vulnerable within the group.
p400
aVAnd so if we think about that,
p401
aVwe have an interesting situation in hands.
p402
aa(lp403
VYears ago, when I was in graduate school,
p404
aVone of my graduate advisors who knew I was interested in feminism \u2014
p405
aVI considered myself a feminist, as I still do,
p406
aVasked a really strange question.
p407
aVHe said, "Tell me what's feminine about feminism."
p408
aVAnd I thought, "Well, that's the dumbest question I've ever heard.
p409
aVFeminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender,
p410
aVso there's nothing feminine about feminism."
p411
aVBut the more I thought about his question,
p412
aVthe more I thought there might be something feminine about feminism.
p413
aVThat is to say, there might be something, on average,
p414
aVdifferent about female brains from male brains
p415
aVthat makes us more attentive to deeply complex social relationships,
p416
aVand more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable.
p417
aa(lp418
VSo whereas the Fathers were extremely attentive
p419
aVto figuring out how to protect individuals from the state,
p420
aVit's possible that if we injected more mothers into this concept,
p421
aVwhat we would have is more of a concept of not just how to protect,
p422
aVbut how to care for each other.
p423
aVAnd maybe that's where we need to go in the future,
p424
aVwhen we take democracy beyond anatomy,
p425
aVis to think less about the individual body in terms of the identity,
p426
aVand think more about those relationships.
p427
aVSo that as we the people try to create a more perfect union,
p428
aVwe're thinking about what we do for each other.

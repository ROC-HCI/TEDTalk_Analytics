VI draw to better understand things.
p5
aVSometimes I make a lot of drawings
p6
aVand I still don't understand what it is I'm drawing.
p7
aVThose of you who are comfortable with digital stuff
p8
aVand even smug about that relationship might be amused to know
p9
aVthat the guy who is best known for "The Way Things Work,"
p10
aVwhile preparing for part of a panel for called Understanding,
p11
aVspent two days trying to get his laptop to communicate with his new CD burner.
p12
aVWho knew about extension managers?
p13
aVI've always managed my own extensions
p14
aVso it never even occurred to me to read the instructions,
p15
aVbut I did finally figure it out. I had to figure it out,
p16
aVbecause along with the invitation
p17
aVcame the frightening reminder that there would be no projector,
p18
aVso bringing those carousels would no longer be necessary
p19
aVbut some alternate form of communication would.
p20
aa(lp21
VNow, I could talk about something that I'm known for,
p22
aVsomething that would be particularly appropriate
p23
aVfor many of the more technically minded people here,
p24
aVor I could talk about something I really care about.
p25
aVI decided to go with the latter.
p26
aVI'm going to talk about Rome.
p27
aVNow, why would I care about Rome, particularly?
p28
aVWell, I went to Rhode Island School of Design
p29
aVin the second half of the '60s to study architecture.
p30
aVI was lucky enough to spend my last year, my fifth year,
p31
aVin Rome as a student. It changed my life.
p32
aVNot the least reason was the fact that I had spent those first four years living at home,
p33
aVdriving into RISD everyday, driving back.
p34
aVI missed the '60s. I read about them; (Laughter)
p35
aVI understand they were pretty interesting. I missed them,
p36
aVbut I did spend that extraordinary year in Rome,
p37
aVand it's a place that is never far from my mind.
p38
aVSo, whenever given an opportunity,
p39
aVI try to do something in it or with it or for it.
p40
aa(lp41
VI also make drawings to help people understand things.
p42
aVThings that I want them to believe I understand.
p43
aVAnd that's what I do as an illustrator,
p44
aVthat's my job.
p45
aVSo, I'm going to show you some pictures of Rome.
p46
aVI've made a lot of drawings of Rome over the years.
p47
aVThese are just drawings of Rome. I get back as often as possible \u2014
p48
aVI need to.
p49
aVAll different materials, all different styles, all different times,
p50
aVdrawings from sketchbooks looking at the details of Rome.
p51
aVPart of the reason I'm showing you these
p52
aVis that it sort of helps illustrate this process I go through
p53
aVof trying to figure out what it is I feel about Rome and why I feel it.
p54
aa(lp55
VThese are sketches of some of the little details.
p56
aVRome is a city full of surprises.
p57
aVI mean, we're talking about unusual perspectives,
p58
aVwe're talking about narrow little winding streets
p59
aVthat suddenly open into vast, sun-drenched piazzas \u2014
p60
aVnever, though, piazzas that are not humanly scaled.
p61
aVPart of the reason for that is the fact that they grew up organically.
p62
aVThat amazing juxtaposition of old and new,
p63
aVthe bits of light that come down between the buildings
p64
aVthat sort of create a map that's traveling above your head of
p65
aVusually blue \u2014 especially in the summer \u2014
p66
aVcompared to the map that you would normally expect to see
p67
aVof conventional streets.
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd I began to think about how I could communicate this in book form.
p70
aVHow could I share my sense of Rome,
p71
aVmy understanding of Rome?
p72
aVAnd I'm going to show you a bunch of dead ends, basically.
p73
aVThe primary reason for all these dead ends is when
p74
aVif you're not quite sure where you're going, you're certainly not going to get there
p75
aVwith any kind of efficiency.
p76
aa(lp77
VHere's a little map. And I thought of maps at the beginning;
p78
aVmaybe I should just try and do a little atlas
p79
aVof my favorite streets and connections in Rome.
p80
aVAnd here's a line of text that actually evolves
p81
aVfrom the exhaust of a scooter zipping across the page.
p82
aVHere that same line of text wraps around a fountain
p83
aVin an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways.
p84
aVMaybe that line of text could be a story
p85
aVto help give some human aspect to this.
p86
aVMaybe I should get away from this map completely,
p87
aVand really be honest about wanting to show you my favorite bits and pieces of Rome
p88
aVand simply kick a soccer ball in the air \u2014
p89
aVwhich happens in so many of the squares in the city \u2014
p90
aVand let it bounce off of things. And I'll simply explain
p91
aVwhat each of those things is that the soccer ball hits.
p92
aVThat seemed like a sort of a cheap shot.
p93
aVBut even though I just started this presentation,
p94
aVthis is not the first thing that I tried to do
p95
aVand I was getting sort of desperate.
p96
aa(lp97
VEventually, I realized that I had really no content that I could count on,
p98
aVso I decided to move towards packaging. (Laughter)
p99
aVI mean, it seems to work for a lot of things.
p100
aVSo I thought a little box set of four small books might do the trick.
p101
aVBut one of the ideas that emerged
p102
aVfrom some of those sketches was the notion of traveling through Rome
p103
aVin different vehicles at different speeds in order
p104
aVto show the different aspects of Rome.
p105
aVSort of an overview of Rome and the plan that you might see from a dirigible.
p106
aVQuick snapshots of things you might see
p107
aVfrom a speeding motor scooter, and very slow
p108
aVwalking through Rome, you might be able to study in more detail
p109
aVsome of the wonderful surfaces and whatnot that you come across.
p110
aa(lp111
VAnyways, I went back to the dirigible notion.
p112
aVWent to Alberto Santos-Dumont.
p113
aVFound one of his dirigibles that had enough dimensions
p114
aVso I could actually use it as a scale
p115
aVthat I would then juxtapose with some of the things in Rome.
p116
aVThis thing would be flying over or past
p117
aVor be parked in front of, but it would be like having a ruler \u2014
p118
aVsort of travel through the pages without being a ruler.
p119
aVNot that you know how long number 11 actually is,
p120
aVbut you would be able to compare number 11 against the Pantheon
p121
aVwith number 11 against the Baths of Caracalla,
p122
aVand so on and so forth. If you were interested.
p123
aa(lp124
VThis is Beatrix. She has a dog named Ajax,
p125
aVshe has purchased a dirigible \u2014 a small dirigible \u2014
p126
aVshe's assembling the structure,
p127
aVAjax is sniffing for holes in the balloon before they set off.
p128
aVShe launches this thing above the Spanish Steps
p129
aVand sets off for an aerial tour of the city.
p130
aVOver the Spanish Steps we go.
p131
aVA nice way to show that river, that stream sort of pouring down the hill.
p132
aVUnfortunately, just across the road from it
p133
aVor quite close by is the Column of Marcus Aurelius,
p134
aVand the diameter of the dirigible makes an impression,
p135
aVas you can see, as she starts trying to read the story that spirals around
p136
aVthe Column of Marcus Aurelius \u2014 gets a little too close, nudges it.
p137
aVThis gives me a chance to suggest to you the structure
p138
aVof the Column of Marcus Aurelius,
p139
aVwhich is really no more than a pile of quarters
p140
aVhigh \u2014 thick quarters. Over the Piazza of Saint Ignacio,
p141
aVcompletely ruining the symmetry, but that aside
p142
aVa spectacular place to visit.
p143
aVA spectacular framework, inside of which you see, usually,
p144
aVextraordinary blue sky.
p145
aVOver the Pantheon and the 26-foot diameter Oculus.
p146
aVShe parks her dirigible, lowers the anchor rope
p147
aVand climbs down for a closer look inside.
p148
aVThe text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced
p149
aVto turn the book around, and you can see it from ground point of view
p150
aVand from her point of view \u2014 looking in the hole,
p151
aVgetting a different kind of perspective,
p152
aVmoving you around the space. Particularly appropriate in a building
p153
aVthat can contain perfectly a sphere
p154
aVdimensions of the diameter being the same
p155
aVas the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the Oculus.
p156
aa(lp157
VUnfortunately for her, the anchor line gets tangled
p158
aVaround the feet of some Boy Scouts who are visiting the Pantheon,
p159
aVand they are immediately yanked out
p160
aVand given an extraordinary but terrifying tour
p161
aVof some of the domes of Rome, which would,
p162
aVfrom their point of view, naturally be hanging upside down.
p163
aVThey bail out as soon as they get to the top of Saint Ivo,
p164
aVthat little spiral structure you see there.
p165
aVShe continues on her way over Piazza Navona.
p166
aVNotices a lot of activity at the Tre Scalini restaurant,
p167
aVis reminded that it is lunchtime and she's hungry.
p168
aVThey keep on motoring towards the Campo de' Fiori,
p169
aVwhich they soon reach. Ajax the dog is put in a basket
p170
aVand lowered with a list of food into the marketplace,
p171
aVwhich flourishes there until about one in the afternoon,
p172
aVand then is completely removed
p173
aVand doesn't appear again until six or seven the following morning.
p174
aVAnyway, the pooch gets back to the dirigible with the stuff.
p175
aVUnfortunately, when she goes to unwrap the prosciutto,
p176
aVAjax makes a lunge for it.
p177
aVShe's managed to save the prosciutto,
p178
aVbut in the process she loses the tablecloth,
p179
aVwhich you can see flying away in the upper left-hand corner.
p180
aVThey continue without their tablecloth,
p181
aVlooking for a place to land this thing so that they can actually have lunch.
p182
aVThey eventually discover a huge wall
p183
aVthat's filled with small holes, ideal for docking a dirigible
p184
aVbecause you've got a place to tie up.
p185
aVTurns out to be the exterior wall \u2014
p186
aVthat part of it that remains \u2014 of the Coliseum,
p187
aVso they park themselves there and have a terrific lunch
p188
aVand have a spectacular view.
p189
aa(lp190
VAt the end of lunch, they untie the anchor, they set off
p191
aVthrough the Baths of Caracalla and over the walls of the city
p192
aVand then an abandoned gatehouse
p193
aVand decide to take one more look at the Pyramid of Cestius,
p194
aVwhich has this lightning rod on top.
p195
aVUnfortunately, that's a problem: they get a little too close,
p196
aVand when you're in a dirigible
p197
aVyou have to be very careful about spikes.
p198
aVSo that sort of brings her little story to a conclusion.
p199
aVMarcello, on the other hand, is sort of a lazy guy,
p200
aVbut he's not due at work until about noon.
p201
aVSo, the alarm goes off and it's five to 12 or so.
p202
aVHe gets up, leaps onto his scooter, races through the city
p203
aVpast the church of Santa Maria della Pace,
p204
aVdown the alleys, through the streets
p205
aVthat tourists may be wandering through,
p206
aVdisturbing the quiet backstreet life of Rome at every turn.
p207
aVThat speed with which he is moving, I hope I have suggested in this little image,
p208
aVwhich, again, can be turned around and read from both sides
p209
aVbecause there's text on the bottom and text on the top,
p210
aVone of which is upside down in this image.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo, he keeps on moving, approaching an unsuspecting waiter
p213
aVwho is trying to deliver two plates of linguine
p214
aVin a delicate white wine clam sauce
p215
aVto diners who are sitting at a table just outside of a restaurant in the street.
p216
aVWaiter catches on, but it's too late.
p217
aVAnd Marcello keeps moving in his scooter.
p218
aVEverything he sees from this point on is slightly affected by the linguine,
p219
aVbut keeps on moving because this guy's got a job to do.
p220
aVRemoves some scaffolding. One of the reasons
p221
aVRome remains the extraordinary place it is that
p222
aVbecause of scaffolding and the determination
p223
aVto maintain the fabric, it is a city that continues
p224
aVto grow and adapt to the needs of the particular time
p225
aVin which it finds itself, or we find it.
p226
aVRight through the Piazza della Rotonda,
p227
aVin front of the Pantheon \u2014 again wreaking havoc \u2014 and finally getting to work.
p228
aVMarcello, as it turns out,
p229
aVis the driver of the number 64 bus,
p230
aVand if you've been on the number 64 bus, you know
p231
aVthat it's driven with the same kind of exuberance
p232
aVas Marcello demonstrated on his scooter.
p233
aa(lp234
VAnd finally Carletto. You see his apartment in the upper left-hand corner.
p235
aVHe's looking at his table;
p236
aVhe's planning to propose this evening to his girlfriend of 40 years, (Laughter)
p237
aVand he wants it to be perfect.
p238
aVHe's got candles out, he's got flowers in the middle
p239
aVand he's trying to figure out where to put the plates and the glasses.
p240
aVBut he's not happy; something's wrong.
p241
aVThe phone rings anyway, he's called to the palazzo.
p242
aVHe saunters \u2014 he saunters at a good clip,
p243
aVbut as compared to all the traveling we've just seen, he's sauntering.
p244
aVEverybody knows Carletto, because he's in entertainment,
p245
aVactually; he's in television.
p246
aVHe's actually in television repair, which is why people know him.
p247
aVSo they all have his number.
p248
aVHe arrives at the palazzo, arrives at the big front door.
p249
aVEnters the courtyard and talks to the custodian,
p250
aVwho tells him that there's been a disaster in the palazzo;
p251
aVnobody's TVs are working
p252
aVand there's a big soccer game coming up,
p253
aVand the crowd is getting a little restless and a little nervous.
p254
aa(lp255
VHe goes down to the basement and starts to check the wiring,
p256
aVand then gradually works his way up to the top of the building,
p257
aVapartment by apartment, checking every television,
p258
aVchecking every connection,
p259
aVhoping to find out what this problem is.
p260
aVHe works his way up, finally, the grand staircase
p261
aVand then a smaller staircase until he reaches the attic.
p262
aVHe opens the window of the attic, of course, and there's a tablecloth
p263
aVwrapped around the building's television antenna.
p264
aVHe removes it, the problems are solved,
p265
aVeverybody in the palazzo is happy.
p266
aVAnd of course, he also solves his own problem.
p267
aVAll he has to do now, with a perfect table,
p268
aVis wait for her to arrive.
p269
aa(lp270
VThat was the first attempt, but it didn't seem substantial enough
p271
aVto convey whatever it was I wanted to convey about Rome.
p272
aVSo I thought, well, I'll just do piazzas,
p273
aVand I'll get inside and underneath
p274
aVand I'll show these things growing
p275
aVand show why they're shaped the way they are and so on.
p276
aVAnd then I thought, that's too complicated. No,
p277
aVI'll just take my favorite bits and pieces
p278
aVand I'll put them inside the Pantheon but keep the scale,
p279
aVso you can see the top of Sant'Ivo and the Pyramid of Cestius
p280
aVand the Tempietto of Bramante all side by side in this amazing space.
p281
aVNow that's one drawing,
p282
aVso I thought maybe it's time for Piranesi to meet Escher. (Laughter)
p283
aa(lp284
VYou see that I'm beginning to really lose control here
p285
aVand also hope.
p286
aVThere's a very thin blue line of exhaust
p287
aVthat sort of runs through this thing that would be kind of the trail that holds it all together.
p288
aVThen I thought, "Wait a minute, what am I doing?"
p289
aVA book is not only a neat way of collecting and storing information,
p290
aVit's a series of layers.
p291
aVI mean, you always peel one layer off another;
p292
aVwe think of them as pages, doing it a certain way.
p293
aVBut think of them as layers. I mean, Rome is a place of layers \u2014
p294
aVhorizontal layers, vertical layers \u2014
p295
aVand I thought, well just peeling off a page would allow me to \u2014
p296
aVif I got you thinking about it the right way \u2014
p297
aVwould allow me to sort of show you the depth of layers.
p298
aVThe stucco on the walls of most of the buildings in Rome
p299
aVcovers the scars; the scars of centuries of change
p300
aVas these structures have been adapted
p301
aVrather than being torn down.
p302
aVIf I do a foldout page on the left-hand side
p303
aVand let you just unfold it, you see behind it what I mean by scar tissue.
p304
aVYou can see that in 1635,
p305
aVit became essential to make smaller windows
p306
aVbecause the bad guys were coming or whatever.
p307
aVAdaptations all get buried under the stucco.
p308
aVI could peel out a page of this palazzo to show you what's going on inside of it.
p309
aVBut more importantly, I could also show you
p310
aVwhat it looks like at the corner of one of those magnificent buildings
p311
aVwith all the massive stone blocks,
p312
aVor the fake stone blocks done with brick and stucco,
p313
aVwhich is more often the case.
p314
aa(lp315
VSo it becomes slightly three-dimensional.
p316
aVI could take you down one of those narrow little streets
p317
aVinto one of those surprising piazzas by using a double gate fold \u2014
p318
aVdouble foldout page \u2014 which, if you were like me
p319
aVreading a pop-up book as a child, you hopefully stick your head into.
p320
aVYou wrap the pages around your head
p321
aVand are in that piazza for that brief period of time.
p322
aVAnd I've really not done anything much more complicated
p323
aVthan make foldout pages.
p324
aVBut then I thought, maybe I could be simpler here.
p325
aVLet's look at the Pantheon and the Piazza della Rotonda in front of it.
p326
aVHere's a book completely wide open.
p327
aVOK, if I don't open the book the whole way,
p328
aVif I just open it 90 degrees, we're looking down the front of the Pantheon,
p329
aVand we're looking sort of at the top, more or less down on the square.
p330
aVAnd if I turn the book the other way,
p331
aVwe're looking across the square at the front of the Pantheon.
p332
aVNo foldouts, no tricks \u2014
p333
aVjust a book that isn't open the whole way.
p334
aVThat seemed promising. I thought, maybe I'll do it inside
p335
aVand I can even combine the foldouts with the only partially opened book.
p336
aVSo we get inside the Pantheon
p337
aVand it grows and so on and so forth.
p338
aVAnd I thought, maybe I'm on the right track,
p339
aVbut it sort of lost its human quality.
p340
aa(lp341
VSo I went back to the notion of story,
p342
aVwhich is always a good thing to have if you're trying to get people
p343
aVto pay attention to a book and pick up information along the way.
p344
aV"Pigeon's Progress" struck me as a catchy title.
p345
aVIf it was a homing pigeon,
p346
aVit would be called "Homer's Odyssey."
p347
aVBut it was the journey of the ... (Laughter)
p348
aVI mean, if a title works, use it. But it would be a journey that went through Rome
p349
aVand showed all the things that I like about Rome.
p350
aVIt's a pigeon sitting on top of a church.
p351
aVGoes off during the day and does normal pigeon stuff. Comes back,
p352
aVthe whole place is covered with scaffolding and green netting
p353
aVand there's no way this pigeon can get home.
p354
aVSo it's a homeless pigeon now
p355
aVand it's going to have to find another place to live,
p356
aVand that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things,
p357
aVand we start with the tall ones and so on.
p358
aVMaybe it has to go back and live with family members;
p359
aVthat's not always a good thing,
p360
aVbut it does sort of bring pigeons together again.
p361
aVAnd I thought, that's sort of interesting,
p362
aVbut maybe there's a person who should be involved in this in some way.
p363
aa(lp364
VSo I kind of came up with this old guy
p365
aVwho spends his life looking after sick pigeons.
p366
aVHe'll go anywhere to get them \u2014 dangerous places and whatnot \u2014
p367
aVand they become really friends with this guy,
p368
aVand learn to do tricks for him and entertain him at lunchtime and stuff like that.
p369
aVThere's a real bond that develops
p370
aVbetween this old man and these pigeons.
p371
aVBut unfortunately he gets sick. He gets really sick at the end of the story.
p372
aVHe's taught them to spell his name, which is Aldo.
p373
aVThey show up one day after three or four days of not seeing him \u2014
p374
aVhe lives in this little garret \u2014
p375
aVand they spell his name and fly around.
p376
aVAnd he finally gets enough strength together
p377
aVto climb up the ladder onto the roof,
p378
aVand all the pigeons, a la Red Balloon, are there waiting for him
p379
aVand they carry him off over the walls of the city.
p380
aVAnd I forgot to mention this:
p381
aVwhenever he lost a pigeon, he would take that pigeon
p382
aVout beyond the walls of the city.
p383
aVIn the old Roman custom, the dead
p384
aVwere never buried within the walls.
p385
aVAnd I thought that's a really cheery story.
p386
aV(Laughter). That's really going to go a long way.
p387
aa(lp388
VSo anyway, I went through ... And again, if packaging doesn't work
p389
aVand if the stories aren't going anywhere,
p390
aVI just come up with titles
p391
aVand hope that a title will sort of kick me off in the right direction.
p392
aVAnd sometimes it does focus me enough
p393
aVand I'll even do a title page.
p394
aVSo, these are all title pages that eventually led me
p395
aVto the solution I settled on, which is the story of a young woman
p396
aVwho sends a message on a homing pigeon \u2014
p397
aVshe lives outside the walls of the city of Rome \u2014 to someone in the city.
p398
aVAnd the pigeon is flying down above the Appian Way here.
p399
aVYou can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth along the way.
p400
aVIf you see the red line,
p401
aVyou are seeing the trail of the pigeon;
p402
aVif you don't see the red line, you are the pigeon.
p403
aVAnd it becomes necessary and possible, at this point,
p404
aVto try to convey what that sense would be like
p405
aVof flying over the city without actually moving.
p406
aVPast the Pyramid of Cestius \u2014
p407
aVthese will seem very familiar to you, even if you haven't been to Rome recently \u2014
p408
aVpast the gatehouse.
p409
aVThis is something that's a little bit unusual.
p410
aVThis pigeon does something that most homing pigeons do not do:
p411
aVit takes the scenic route, (Laughter) which was a device
p412
aVthat I felt was necessary to actually extend this book
p413
aVbeyond about four pages.
p414
aa(lp415
VSo, we circle around the Coliseum, past the Church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin
p416
aVand the Temple of Hercules towards the river.
p417
aVWe almost collide with the cornice of the Palazzo Farnese \u2014
p418
aVdesigned by Michelangelo,
p419
aVbuilt of stone taken from the Coliseum \u2014 narrow escape.
p420
aVWe swoop down over the Campo de' Fiori.
p421
aVThis is one of those things I show to my students
p422
aVbecause it's a complete bastardization \u2014
p423
aVa denial of any rules of perspective.
p424
aVThe only rule of perspective that I think matters is
p425
aVif it looks believable, you've succeeded.
p426
aVBut you try and figure out where the vanishing points meet here;
p427
aVa couple are on Mars and
p428
aVa couple of others in Cremona.
p429
aVBut into the piazza in front of Santa Maria della Pace,
p430
aVwhere invariably a soccer game is going on,
p431
aVand we're hit by a soccer ball.
p432
aVNow this is a terrible illustration of being hit by a soccer ball.
p433
aVI have all the pieces:
p434
aVthere's Santa Maria della Pace, there's a soccer ball,
p435
aVthere's a little bit of a bird's wing \u2014 nothing's happening,
p436
aVso I had to rethink it.
p437
aVAnd if you do want to see Santa Maria della Pace,
p438
aVthese books are really flexible, incredibly interactive \u2014
p439
aVjust turn it around and look at it the other way.
p440
aa(lp441
VThrough the alley, we can see the impact is captured in the red line.
p442
aVAnd then bird manages to pull itself together past this medieval tower \u2014
p443
aVone of the few remaining medieval towers \u2014
p444
aVtowards the church of Sant'Agnese
p445
aVand around the dome looking down into Piazza Navona \u2014
p446
aVwhich we've already mentioned and seen and flown over a couple of times;
p447
aVthere's the Bernini statue of the Four Rivers \u2014
p448
aVand then past the wonderful Borromini Sant'Ivo,
p449
aVstopping just long enough on the 26-foot diameter Oculus
p450
aVof the Pantheon to catch our breath.
p451
aVAnd then we can swoop inside and around; and because we're flying,
p452
aVwe don't really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time,
p453
aVso this drawing can be oriented in any way on the page.
p454
aa(lp455
VWe get a little exuberant as we pass Gesu;
p456
aVit's not surprising to sort of mimic the architecture in this way.
p457
aVPast the wonderful wall filled with the juxtaposition that I was talking about;
p458
aVbeautiful carvings set into the walls above the neon "Ristorante" sign, and so on.
p459
aVAnd eventually, we arrive at the courtyard of the palazzo,
p460
aVwhich is our destination.
p461
aVStraight up through the courtyard
p462
aVinto a little window into the attic,
p463
aVwhere somebody is working at the drawing board.
p464
aVHe removes the message from the leg of the bird; this is what it says.
p465
aVAs we look at the drawing board,
p466
aVwe see what he's working on is, in fact,
p467
aVa map of the journey that the pigeon has just taken,
p468
aVand the red line extends through all the sights.
p469
aVAnd if you want the information, so that we complete this cycle of understanding,
p470
aVall you have to do is read these paragraphs.
p471
aVThank you very much.

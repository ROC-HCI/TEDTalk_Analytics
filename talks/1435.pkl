VUsually I like working in my shop,
p5
aVbut when it's raining and the driveway outside turns into a river,
p6
aVthen I just love it.
p7
aVAnd I'll cut some wood and drill some holes and watch the water,
p8
aVand maybe I'll have to walk around and look for washers.
p9
aVYou have no idea how much time I spend.
p10
aa(lp11
VThis is the "Double Raindrop."
p12
aVOf all my sculptures, it's the most talkative.
p13
aVIt adds together the interference pattern
p14
aVfrom two raindrops that land near each other.
p15
aVInstead of expanding circles, they're expanding hexagons.
p16
aa(lp17
VAll the sculptures move by mechanical means.
p18
aVDo you see how there's three peaks to the yellow sine wave?
p19
aVRight here I'm adding a sine wave with four peaks and turning it on.
p20
aa(lp21
VEight hundred two-liter soda bottles \u2014
p22
aVoh yea.
p23
aV(Laughter)
p24
aVFour hundred aluminum cans.
p25
aa(lp26
VTule is a reed that's native to California,
p27
aVand the best thing about working with it is that it smells just delicious.
p28
aVA single drop of rain
p29
aVincreasing amplitude.
p30
aVThe spiral eddy that trails a paddle on a rafting trip.
p31
aa(lp32
VThis adds together four different waves.
p33
aVAnd here I'm going to pull out the double wavelengths
p34
aVand increase the single.
p35
aVThe mechanism that drives it has nine motors
p36
aVand about 3,000 pulleys.
p37
aa(lp38
VFour hundred and forty-five strings in a three-dimensional weave.
p39
aVTransferred to a larger scale \u2014
p40
aVactually a lot larger, with a lot of help \u2014
p41
aV14,064 bicycle reflectors \u2014
p42
aVa 20-day install.
p43
aa(lp44
V"Connected" is a collaboration
p45
aVwith choreographer Gideon Obarzanek.
p46
aVStrings attached to dancers.
p47
aVThis is very early rehearsal footage,
p48
aVbut the finished work's on tour
p49
aVand is actually coming through L.A. in a couple weeks.
p50
aa(lp51
VA pair of helices and 40 wooden slats.
p52
aVTake your finger and draw this line.
p53
aVSummer, fall, winter, spring,
p54
aVnoon, dusk, dark, dawn.
p55
aVHave you ever seen those stratus clouds
p56
aVthat go in parallel stripes across the sky?
p57
aVDid you know that's a continuous sheet of cloud
p58
aVthat's dipping in and out of the condensation layer?
p59
aVWhat if every seemingly isolated object
p60
aVwas actually just where the continuous wave of that object
p61
aVpoked through into our world?
p62
aVThe Earth is neither flat nor round.
p63
aVIt's wavy.
p64
aa(lp65
VIt sounds good, but I'll bet you know in your gut that it's not the whole truth,
p66
aVand I'll tell you why.
p67
aVI have a two-year-old daughter who's the best thing ever.
p68
aVAnd I'm just going to come out and say it:
p69
aVMy daughter is not a wave.
p70
aVAnd you might say, "Surely, Rueben, if you took even just the slightest step back,
p71
aVthe cycles of hunger and eating,
p72
aVwaking and sleeping, laughing and crying
p73
aVwould emerge as pattern."
p74
aVBut I would say, "If I did that,
p75
aVtoo much would be lost."
p76
aa(lp77
VThis tension between the need to look deeper
p78
aVand the beauty and immediacy of the world,
p79
aVwhere if you even try to look deeper you've already missed what you're looking for,
p80
aVthis tension is what makes the sculptures move.
p81
aVAnd for me, the path between these two extremes
p82
aVtakes the shape of a wave.
p83
aa(lp84
VLet me show you one more.
p85
aVThank you very much. Thanks.
p86
aV(Applause)
p87
aa(lp88
VThanks.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Applause)
p91
aa(lp92
VJune Cohen: Looking at each of your sculptures,
p93
aVthey evoke so many different images.
p94
aVSome of them are like the wind and some are like waves,
p95
aVand sometimes they look alive and sometimes they seem like math.
p96
aVIs there an actual inspiration behind each one?
p97
aVAre you thinking of something physical or somthing tangible as you design it?
p98
aa(lp99
VRM: Well some of them definitely have a direct observation \u2014
p100
aVlike literally two raindrops falling,
p101
aVand just watching that pattern is so stunning.
p102
aVAnd then just trying to figure out how to make that using stuff.
p103
aVI like working with my hands.
p104
aVThere's nothing better than cutting a piece of wood
p105
aVand trying to make it move.
p106
aa(lp107
VJC: And does it ever change?
p108
aVDo you think you're designing one thing,
p109
aVand then when it's produced it looks like something else?
p110
aa(lp111
VRM: The "Double Raindrop" I worked on for nine months,
p112
aVand when I finally turned it on,
p113
aVI actually hated it.
p114
aVThe very moment I turned it on, I hated it.
p115
aVIt was like a really deep-down gut reaction, and I wanted to throw it out.
p116
aVAnd I happened to have a friend who was over,
p117
aVand he said, "Why don't you just wait."
p118
aVAnd I waited, and the next day I liked it a bit better,
p119
aVthe next day I liked it a bit better, and now I really love it.
p120
aVAnd so I guess, one, the gut reactions a little bit wrong sometimes,
p121
aVand two, it does not look like as expected.
p122
aa(lp123
VJC: The relationship evolves over time.
p124
aVWell thank you so much. That was a gorgeous treat for us.
p125
aa(lp126
VRM: Thanks. (JC: Thank you, Reuben.)

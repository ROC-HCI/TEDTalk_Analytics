VHi. Today, I'm going to take you through glimpses
p5
aVof about eight of my projects,
p6
aVdone in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors.
p7
aVWe call ourselves Pors and Rao,
p8
aVand we live and work in India.
p9
aa(lp10
VI'd like to begin with my very first object,
p11
aVwhich I call "The Uncle Phone."
p12
aVAnd it was inspired by my uncle's peculiar habit
p13
aVof constantly asking me to do things for him,
p14
aValmost like I were an extension of his body \u2014
p15
aVto turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water,
p16
aVa pack of cigarettes.
p17
aVAnd as I grew up, it became worse and worse,
p18
aVAnd I started to think of it as a form of control.
p19
aVBut of course, I could never say anything,
p20
aVbecause the uncle is a respected figure
p21
aVin the Indian family.
p22
aVAnd the situation that irked me and mystified me the most
p23
aVwas his use of a landline telephone.
p24
aVHe would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him.
p25
aVAnd so as a response and as a gift to my uncle,
p26
aVI made him "The Uncle Phone."
p27
aVIt's so long that it requires two people to use it.
p28
aVIt's exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that's designed for one person.
p29
aa(lp30
VBut the problem is that, when I left home and went to college,
p31
aVI started missing his commands.
p32
aVAnd so I made him a golden typewriter
p33
aVthrough which he could dispense his commands
p34
aVto nephews and nieces around the world as an email.
p35
aVSo what he had to do was take a piece of paper, roll it into the carriage,
p36
aVtype his email or command and pull the paper out.
p37
aVThis device would automatically send the intended person
p38
aVthe letter as an email.
p39
aVSo here you can see, we embedded a lot of electronics
p40
aVthat understands all of the mechanical actions
p41
aVand converts it to digital.
p42
aVSo my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface.
p43
aVAnd of course, the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism,
p44
aVthe way my uncle likes it.
p45
aa(lp46
VThe next work is a sound-sensitive installation
p47
aVthat we affectionately call "The Pygmies."
p48
aVAnd we wanted to work with a notion of being
p49
aVsurrounded by a tribe of very shy, sensitive and sweet creatures.
p50
aVSo how it works is we have these panels, which we have on the wall,
p51
aVand behind them, we have these little creatures which hide.
p52
aVAnd as soon as it's silent, they sort of creep out.
p53
aVAnd if it's even more silent, they stretch their necks out.
p54
aVAnd at the slightest sound, they hide back again.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo we had these panels on three walls of a room.
p57
aVAnd we had over 500 of these little pygmies hiding behind them.
p58
aVSo this is how it works.
p59
aVThis is a video prototype.
p60
aVSo when it's quiet, it's sort of coming out from behind the panels.
p61
aVAnd they hear like humans do, or real creatures do.
p62
aVSo they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile.
p63
aVAnd they don't react to background sounds.
p64
aVYou'll hear a train in moment that they don't react to.
p65
aV(Noise)
p66
aVBut they react to foreground sounds. You'll hear that in a second.
p67
aV(Whistling)
p68
aVSo we worked very hard
p69
aVto make them as lifelike as possible.
p70
aVSo each pygmy has its own behavior, psyche,
p71
aVmood swings, personalities and so on.
p72
aVSo this is a very early prototype.
p73
aVOf course, it got much better after that.
p74
aVAnd we made them react to people,
p75
aVbut we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them.
p76
aa(lp77
VThis is a video installation called "The Missing Person."
p78
aVAnd we were quite intrigued
p79
aVwith playing with the notion of invisibility.
p80
aVHow would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility?
p81
aVSo we worked with a company
p82
aVthat specializes in camera surveillance,
p83
aVand we asked them to develop a piece of software with us,
p84
aVusing a camera
p85
aVthat could look at people in the room, track them
p86
aVand replace one person with the background, rendering them invisible.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo I'm just going to show you a very early prototype.
p89
aVOn the right side you can see my colleague Soren,
p90
aVwho's actually in the space.
p91
aVAnd on the left side, you'll see the processed video
p92
aVwhere the camera has made him invisible.
p93
aVSoren enters the room. Pop! He goes invisible.
p94
aVAnd you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing.
p95
aVIt's a very early video,
p96
aVso we haven't yet dealt with the overlap and all of that,
p97
aVbut that got refined pretty soon, later.
p98
aVSo how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space,
p99
aVand we had one monitor, one on each wall.
p100
aVAnd as people walked into the room,
p101
aVthey would see themselves in the monitor, except with one difference:
p102
aVone person was constantly invisible
p103
aVwherever they moved in the room.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo this is a work called "The Sun Shadow."
p106
aVAnd it was almost like a sheet of paper,
p107
aVlike a cutout of a childlike drawing
p108
aVof an oil spill or a sun.
p109
aVAnd from the front, this object appeared to be very strong and robust,
p110
aVand from the side, it almost seemed very weak.
p111
aVSo people would walking into the room and they'd almost ignore it,
p112
aVthinking it was some crap laying around.
p113
aVBut as soon as they passed by,
p114
aVit would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion.
p115
aVAnd it would get exhausted, and it would collapse every time.
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
VSo this work
p120
aVis a caricature of an upside-down man.
p121
aVHis head is so heavy, full of heavy thoughts,
p122
aVthat it's sort of fallen into his hat,
p123
aVand his body's grown out of him almost like a plant.
p124
aVWell what he does is he moves around
p125
aVin a very drunken fashion on his head
p126
aVin a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement.
p127
aVAnd it's kind of constrained by that circle.
p128
aVBecause if that circle weren't there, and the floor was very even,
p129
aVit would start to wander about in the space.
p130
aVAnd there's no wires.
p131
aVSo I'll just show you an instance \u2014
p132
aVso when people enter the room, it activates this object.
p133
aVAnd it very slowly, over a few minutes,
p134
aVsort of painfully goes up,
p135
aVand then it gains momentum
p136
aVand it looks like it's almost about to fall.
p137
aVAnd this is an important moment,
p138
aVbecause we wanted to instill in the viewer
p139
aVan instinct to almost go and help, or save the subject.
p140
aVBut it doesn't really need it,
p141
aVbecause it, again, sort of manages to pull itself up.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo this work was a real technical challenge for us,
p144
aVand we worked very hard, like most of our works, over years
p145
aVto get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics.
p146
aVAnd it was very important for us
p147
aVto establish the exact moment that it would fall,
p148
aVbecause if we made it in a way that it would topple over,
p149
aVthen it would damage itself,
p150
aVand if it didn't fall enough, it wouldn't instill that fatalism,
p151
aVor that sense of wanting to go and help it.
p152
aVSo I'm going to show you a very quick video
p153
aVwhere we are doing a test scenario \u2014 it's much faster.
p154
aVThat's my colleague. He's let it go.
p155
aVNow he's getting nervous, so he's going to go catch it.
p156
aVBut he doesn't need to,
p157
aVbecause it manages to lift itself up on its own.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo this is a work that we were very intrigued with,
p160
aVworking with the aesthetic of fur
p161
aVembedded with thousands of tiny different sizes
p162
aVof fiber optics, which twinkle like the night sky.
p163
aVAnd it's at the scale of the night sky.
p164
aVSo we wrapped this around a blob-like form,
p165
aVwhich is in the shape of a teddy bear,
p166
aVwhich was hanging from the ceiling.
p167
aVAnd the idea was to sort of contrast
p168
aVsomething very cold and distant and abstract like the universe
p169
aVinto the familiar form of a teddy bear,
p170
aVwhich is very comforting and intimate.
p171
aVAnd the idea was that at some point
p172
aVyou would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear
p173
aVand you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space,
p174
aVand as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo this is the last work, and a work in progress,
p177
aVand it's called "Space Filler."
p178
aVWell imagine a small cube that's about this big
p179
aVstanding in front of you in the middle of the room,
p180
aVand as you approached it, it tried to intimidate you
p181
aVby growing into a cube
p182
aVthat's twice its height and [eight] times its volume.
p183
aVAnd so this object is constantly expanding and contracting
p184
aVto create a dynamic with people moving around it \u2014
p185
aValmost like it were trying
p186
aVto conceal a secret within its seams or something.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo we work with a lot of technology,
p189
aVbut we don't really love technology,
p190
aVbecause it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years.
p191
aVBut we use it because we're interested
p192
aVin the way that it can help us
p193
aVto express the emotions and behavioral patterns
p194
aVin these creatures that we create.
p195
aVAnd once a creature pops into our minds,
p196
aVit's almost like the process of creation
p197
aVis to discover the way this creature really wants to exist
p198
aVand what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move.
p199
aa(lp200
VThank you.

VHow many times have you used the word "awesome" today?
p5
aVOnce? Twice? Seventeen times?
p6
aVDo you remember what you were describing
p7
aVwhen you used the word?
p8
aVNo, I didn't think so, because it's come down to this, people:
p9
aVYou're using the word incorrectly,
p10
aVand tonight I hope to show you
p11
aVhow to put the "awe" back in "awesome."
p12
aa(lp13
VRecently, I was dining at an outdoor cafe,
p14
aVand the server came up to our table,
p15
aVand asked us if we had dined there before,
p16
aVand I said, "Yes, yes, we have."
p17
aVAnd she said, "Awesome."
p18
aVAnd I thought, "Really?
p19
aVAwesome or just merely good
p20
aVthat we decided to visit your restaurant again?"
p21
aa(lp22
VThe other day, one of my coworkers asked me
p23
aVif I could save that file as a PDF,
p24
aVand I said, "Well, of course," and he said, "Awesome."
p25
aVSeriously, can saving anything as a PDF
p26
aVbe awesome?
p27
aa(lp28
VSadly, the frequent overuse of the word "awesome"
p29
aVhas now replaced words like "great" and "thank you."
p30
aVSo Webster's dictionary defines the word "awesome"
p31
aVas fear mingled with admiration or reverence,
p32
aVa feeling produced by something majestic.
p33
aVNow, with that in mind,
p34
aVwas your Quiznos sandwich awesome?
p35
aVHow about that parking space? Was that awesome?
p36
aVOr that game the other day? Was that awesome?
p37
aVThe answer is no, no and no.
p38
aVA sandwich can be delicious,
p39
aVthat parking space can be nearby,
p40
aVand that game can be a blowout,
p41
aVbut not everything can be awesome.
p42
aV(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VSo when you use the word "awesome"
p45
aVto describe the most mundane of things,
p46
aVyou're taking away the very power of the word.
p47
aVThis author says, "Snowy days
p48
aVor finding money in your pants is awesome."
p49
aV(Laughter)
p50
aVUm, no, it is not,
p51
aVand we need to raise the bar for this poor schmuck. (Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VSo in other words, if you have everything, you value nothing.
p54
aVIt's a lot like drinking from a firehose
p55
aVlike this jackass right here.
p56
aVThere's no dynamic, there's no highs or lows,
p57
aVif everything is awesome.
p58
aa(lp59
VLadies and gentlemen, here are 10 things
p60
aVthat are truly awesome.
p61
aa(lp62
VImagine, if you will, having to schlep
p63
aVeverything on your back.
p64
aVWouldn't this be easier for me
p65
aVif I could roll this home?
p66
aVYes, so I think I'll invent the wheel.
p67
aVThe wheel, ladies and gentlemen.
p68
aVIs the wheel awesome? Say it with me.
p69
aVYes, the wheel is awesome!
p70
aa(lp71
VThe Great Pyramids were the tallest
p72
aVman-made structure in the world
p73
aVfor 4,000 years.
p74
aVPharaoh had his slaves move millions of blocks
p75
aVjust to this site to erect a big freaking headstone.
p76
aVWere the Great Pyramids awesome?
p77
aVYes, the pyramids were awesome.
p78
aa(lp79
VThe Grand Canyon. Come on.
p80
aVIt's almost 80 million years old.
p81
aVIs the Grand Canyon awesome?
p82
aVYes, the Grand Canyon is.
p83
aa(lp84
VLouis Daguerre invented photography in 1829,
p85
aVand earlier today,
p86
aVwhen you whipped out your smartphone
p87
aVand you took a shot of your awesome sandwich,
p88
aVand you know who you are \u2014
p89
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p90
aVwasn't that easier than exposing the image
p91
aVto copper plates coated with iodized silver?
p92
aVI mean, come on. Is photography awesome?
p93
aVYes, photography is awesome.
p94
aa(lp95
VD-Day, June 6, 1944,
p96
aVthe Allied invasion of Normandy,
p97
aVthe largest amphibious invasion in world history.
p98
aVWas D-Day awesome? Yes, it was awesome.
p99
aa(lp100
VDid you eat food today? Did you eat?
p101
aVThen you can thank the honeybee, that's the one,
p102
aVbecause if crops aren't pollinated, we can't grow food,
p103
aVand then we're all going to die.
p104
aVIt's just like that.
p105
aVBut it's not like a flower can just get up
p106
aVand have sex with another flower,
p107
aValthough that would be awesome.
p108
aV(Laughter)
p109
aVBees are awesome. Are you kidding me?
p110
aa(lp111
VLanding on the moon! Come on!
p112
aVApollo 11. Are you kidding me?
p113
aVSixty-six years after the Wright Brothers
p114
aVtook off from Kitty Hawk, North Carolina,
p115
aVNeil Armstrong was 240,000 miles away.
p116
aVThat's like from here to the moon.
p117
aV(Laughter)
p118
aVThat's one small step for a man,
p119
aVone giant leap for awesome!
p120
aVYou're damn right, it was.
p121
aa(lp122
VWoodstock, 1969: Rolling Stone Magazine said
p123
aVthis changed the history of rock and roll.
p124
aVTickets were only 24 dollars back then.
p125
aVYou can't even buy a freaking t-shirt for that now.
p126
aVJimi Hendrix's version of "The Star-Spangled Banner"
p127
aVwas the most iconic.
p128
aVWas Woodstock awesome? Yes, it was awesome.
p129
aa(lp130
VSharks! They're at the top of the food chain.
p131
aVSharks have multiple rows of teeth
p132
aVthat grow in their jaw
p133
aVand they move forward like a conveyor belt.
p134
aVSome sharks can lose 30,000 teeth in their lifetime.
p135
aVDoes awesome inspire fear?
p136
aVOh, hell yeah, sharks are awesome!
p137
aa(lp138
VThe Internet was born in 1982
p139
aVand it instantly took over global communication,
p140
aVand later tonight, when all these PowerPoints
p141
aVare uplifted to the Internet
p142
aVso that a guy in Siberia can get drunk
p143
aVand watch this crap,

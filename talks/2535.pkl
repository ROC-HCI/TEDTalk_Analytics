VI could never have imagined
p5
aVthat a 19-year-old suicide bomber
p6
aVwould actually teach me a valuable lesson.
p7
aVBut he did.
p8
aVHe taught me to never presume anything
p9
aVabout anyone you don't know.
p10
aa(lp11
VOn a Thursday morning in July 2005,
p12
aVthe bomber and I, unknowingly,
p13
aVboarded the same train carriage at the same time,
p14
aVstanding, apparently, just feet apart.
p15
aVI didn't see him.
p16
aVActually, I didn't see anyone.
p17
aVYou know not to look at anyone on the Tube,
p18
aVbut I guess he saw me.
p19
aVI guess he looked at all of us,
p20
aVas his hand hovered over the detonation switch.
p21
aVI've often wondered: What was he thinking?
p22
aVEspecially in those final seconds.
p23
aa(lp24
VI know it wasn't personal.
p25
aVHe didn't set out to kill or maim me, Gill Hicks.
p26
aVI mean \u2014 he didn't know me.
p27
aVNo.
p28
aVInstead, he gave me
p29
aVan unwarranted and an unwanted label.
p30
aVI had become the enemy.
p31
aVTo him, I was the "other,"
p32
aVthe "them," as opposed to "us."
p33
aVThe label "enemy" allowed him to dehumanize us.
p34
aVIt allowed him to push that button.
p35
aVAnd he wasn't selective.
p36
aVTwenty-six precious lives were taken in my carriage alone,
p37
aVand I was almost one of them.
p38
aa(lp39
VIn the time it takes to draw a breath,
p40
aVwe were plunged into a darkness so immense
p41
aVthat it was almost tangible;
p42
aVwhat I imagine wading through tar might be like.
p43
aVWe didn't know we were the enemy.
p44
aVWe were just a bunch of commuters who, minutes earlier,
p45
aVhad followed the Tube etiquette:
p46
aVno direct eye contact,
p47
aVno talking
p48
aVand absolutely no conversation.
p49
aa(lp50
VBut in the lifting of the darkness,
p51
aVwe were reaching out.
p52
aVWe were helping each other.
p53
aVWe were calling out our names,
p54
aVa little bit like a roll call,
p55
aVwaiting for responses.
p56
aa(lp57
V"I'm Gill. I'm here.
p58
aVI'm alive.
p59
aVOK."
p60
aa(lp61
V"I'm Gill.
p62
aVHere.
p63
aVAlive.
p64
aVOK."
p65
aa(lp66
VI didn't know Alison.
p67
aVBut I listened for her check-ins every few minutes.
p68
aVI didn't know Richard.
p69
aVBut it mattered to me that he survived.
p70
aa(lp71
VAll I shared with them
p72
aVwas my first name.
p73
aVThey didn't know
p74
aVthat I was a head of a department at the Design Council.
p75
aVAnd here is my beloved briefcase,
p76
aValso rescued from that morning.
p77
aVThey didn't know that I published architecture and design journals,
p78
aVthat I was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts,
p79
aVthat I wore black \u2014
p80
aVstill do \u2014
p81
aVthat I smoked cigarillos.
p82
aVI don't smoke cigarillos anymore.
p83
aVI drank gin and I watched TED Talks,
p84
aVof course, never dreaming that one day I would be standing,
p85
aVbalancing on prosthetic legs,
p86
aVgiving a talk.
p87
aa(lp88
VI was a young Australian woman doing extraordinary things in London.
p89
aVAnd I wasn't ready for that all to end.
p90
aVI was so determined to survive
p91
aVthat I used my scarf to tie tourniquets around the tops of my legs,
p92
aVand I just shut everything and everyone out,
p93
aVto focus, to listen to myself,
p94
aVto be guided by instinct alone.
p95
aVI lowered my breathing rate.
p96
aVI elevated my thighs.
p97
aVI held myself upright
p98
aVand I fought the urge to close my eyes.
p99
aa(lp100
VI held on for almost an hour,
p101
aVan hour to contemplate the whole of my life
p102
aVup until this point.
p103
aVPerhaps I should have done more.
p104
aVPerhaps I could have lived more, seen more.
p105
aVMaybe I should have gone running, dancing, taken up yoga.
p106
aVBut my priority and my focus was always my work.
p107
aVI lived to work.
p108
aVWho I was on my business card
p109
aVmattered to me.
p110
aVBut it didn't matter down in that tunnel.
p111
aa(lp112
VBy the time I felt that first touch
p113
aVfrom one of my rescuers,
p114
aVI was unable to speak,
p115
aVunable to say even a small word, like "Gill."
p116
aVI surrendered my body to them.
p117
aVI had done all I possibly could,
p118
aVand now I was in their hands.
p119
aa(lp120
VI understood
p121
aVjust who and what humanity really is,
p122
aVwhen I first saw the ID tag
p123
aVthat was given to me when I was admitted to hospital.
p124
aVAnd it read:
p125
aV"One unknown estimated female."
p126
aVOne unknown estimated female.
p127
aVThose four words were my gift.
p128
aVWhat they told me very clearly
p129
aVwas that my life was saved,
p130
aVpurely because I was a human being.
p131
aVDifference of any kind made no difference
p132
aVto the extraordinary lengths that the rescuers were prepared to go
p133
aVto save my life,
p134
aVto save as many unknowns as they could,
p135
aVand putting their own lives at risk.
p136
aVTo them, it didn't matter if I was rich or poor,
p137
aVthe color of my skin,
p138
aVwhether I was male or female,
p139
aVmy sexual orientation,
p140
aVwho I voted for,
p141
aVwhether I was educated,
p142
aVif I had a faith or no faith at all.
p143
aVNothing mattered
p144
aVother than I was a precious human life.
p145
aa(lp146
VI see myself as a living fact.
p147
aVI am proof
p148
aVthat unconditional love and respect can not only save,
p149
aVbut it can transform lives.
p150
aVHere is a wonderful image of one of my rescuers, Andy, and I
p151
aVtaken just last year.
p152
aVTen years after the event,
p153
aVand here we are, arm in arm.
p154
aa(lp155
VThroughout all the chaos,
p156
aVmy hand was held tightly.
p157
aVMy face was stroked gently.
p158
aVWhat did I feel?
p159
aVI felt loved.
p160
aVWhat's shielded me from hatred and wanting retribution,
p161
aVwhat's given me the courage to say:
p162
aVthis ends with me
p163
aVis love.
p164
aVI was loved.
p165
aa(lp166
VI believe the potential for widespread positive change
p167
aVis absolutely enormous
p168
aVbecause I know what we're capable of.
p169
aVI know the brilliance of humanity.
p170
aVSo this leaves me with some pretty big things to ponder
p171
aVand some questions for us all to consider:
p172
aVIs what unites us not far greater than what can ever divide?
p173
aVDoes it have to take a tragedy or a disaster
p174
aVfor us to feel deeply connected as one species,
p175
aVas human beings?
p176
aVAnd when will we embrace the wisdom of our era
p177
aVto rise above mere tolerance
p178
aVand move to an acceptance
p179
aVfor all who are only a label until we know them?
p180
aa(lp181
VThank you.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Applause)

Gill Hicks is considered to be one of the most thought provoking, powerful and life affirming speakers in Australia and the UK. She is globally known as a survivor of the London terrorist bombings on July 7, 2005. She survived, but suffered severe and permanent injuries, losing both legs from just below the knee.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">Originally from Adelaide, Australia, Hicks has lived in London since 1991, however in 2012 Hicks returned to Australia where she operates nationally and internationally through her not for profit&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.madnests.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">M.A.D. for Peace</a>&nbsp;network and her public speaking work.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">Her unique and compelling projects and initiative&#39;s, aimed at both deterring anyone from following the path of violent extremism and building sustainable models for peace, draw upon Hicks&#39;s previous roles within the Arts.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">An impressive career before the bombings included being at the helm of some of the UK&#39;s most prestigious and respected institutions -- including publishing director of the architecture, design and contemporary culture magazine, <em>Blueprint</em>, director of the Dangerous Minds design consultancy and head curator at the Design Council. It wasn&rsquo;t until after the bombings that Hicks decided to dedicate her life to being an advocate for peace. She has made it her mission to use her experiences and her new body form to positive effect.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">In 2007 Hicks founded the not for profit organisation M.A.D. for Peace, a platform that connects people globally and encourages us to think of &quot;Peace as a Verb,&quot; something that we have an individual responsibility to do every day.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">In 2008 Hicks released her first book,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/OneUnknown\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>One Unknown</em></a>, named after the chilling label given to her as she arrived to hospital as an unidentified body. The book was shortlisted for the Mind Book of the Year Awards.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">Since her return to Australia in 2012, Hicks has been recognised as South Australian, Australian of the Year 2015 and is Chair to the Innovation component for the Committee for Adelaide.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">In 2013 Hicks welcomed her daughter, Amelie into the world.

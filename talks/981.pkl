VEvery presentation needs this slide in it.
p5
aV(Laughter)
p6
aVIt's beautiful, isn't it?
p7
aVDo you see?
p8
aVAll the points, all the lines \u2014
p9
aVit's incredible.
p10
aVIt is the network;
p11
aVand in my case, the network has been important in media,
p12
aVbecause I get to connect to people.
p13
aVIsn't it amazing?
p14
aVThrough that, I connect to people.
p15
aVAnd the way that I've been doing it
p16
aVhas been multifaceted.
p17
aVFor example, I get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners.
p18
aV(Laughter)
p19
aVI put together projects like Earth Sandwich,
p20
aVwhere I ask people
p21
aVto try and simultaneously place
p22
aVtwo pieces of bread
p23
aVperfectly opposite each other on the Earth.
p24
aVAnd people started laying bread in tribute,
p25
aVand eventually a team was able to do it
p26
aVbetween New Zealand and Spain.
p27
aVIt's pretty incredible \u2014 the video's online.
p28
aVConnecting to people in projects
p29
aVlike YoungmeNowme for example.
p30
aVIn YoungmeNowme, the audience was asked
p31
aVto find a childhood photograph of themselves
p32
aVand restage it as an adult.
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVThis is the same person \u2014
p35
aVtop photo, James, bottom photo, [Jennifer].
p36
aVPoignant.
p37
aVThis was a Mother's Day gift.
p38
aV(Laughter)
p39
aVParticularly creepy.
p40
aV(Applause)
p41
aV(Laughter)
p42
aVMy favorite of these photos, which I couldn't find,
p43
aVis there's a picture of a 30 year-old woman or so
p44
aVwith a little baby on her lap,
p45
aVand the next photo is a 220-lb man
p46
aVwith a tiny, little old lady peaking over his shoulder.
p47
aa(lp48
VBut this project changed the way
p49
aVthat I thought about connecting to people.
p50
aVThis is project called Ray.
p51
aVAnd what happened was I was sent this piece of audio
p52
aVand had no idea who generated the audio.
p53
aVSomebody said, "You have to listen to this."
p54
aVAnd this is what came to me.
p55
aa(lp56
VRecording: Hi, my name is Ray,
p57
aVand on yesterday my daughter called me
p58
aVbecause she was stressed out
p59
aVbecause of things that were going on on her job
p60
aVthat she felt was quite unfair.
p61
aVBeing quite disturbed, she called for comfort,
p62
aVand I didn't really know what to tell her,
p63
aVbecause we have to deal with so much mess in our society.
p64
aVSo I was led to write this song just for her,
p65
aVjust to give her some encouragement
p66
aVwhile dealing with stress and pressures on her job.
p67
aVAnd I figured I'd put it on the Internet
p68
aVfor all employees under stress
p69
aVto help you better deal with what you're going through on your job.
p70
aVHere's how the song goes.
p71
aa(lp72
V\u266b I'm about to whip somebody's ass \u266b
p73
aa(lp74
V\u266b Oh, I'm about to whip somebody's ass \u266b
p75
aa(lp76
V\u266b Oh, if you don't leave me alone, \u266b
p77
aa(lp78
V\u266b you gonna have to send me home \u266b
p79
aa(lp80
V\u266b 'Cause I'm about to whip somebody's ass \u266b
p81
aa(lp82
VNow you might not be able to sing that out loud,
p83
aVbut you can hum it to yourself, and you know what the words are.
p84
aVAnd let it give you some strength to get the next few moments on your job.
p85
aVAll right. Stay strong. Peace.
p86
aa(lp87
VZe Frank: So \u2014 yeah.
p88
aVNo, no, no, shush. We've got to go quickly.
p89
aVSo I was so moved by this \u2014
p90
aVthis is incredible. This was connecting, right.
p91
aVThis was, at a distance,
p92
aVrealizing that someone was feeling something,
p93
aVwanting to affect them in a particular way,
p94
aVusing media to do it, putting it online
p95
aVand realizing that there was a greater impact.
p96
aVThis was incredible; this is what I wanted to do.
p97
aVSo the first thing I thought of is we have to thank him.
p98
aVAnd I asked my audience, I said, "Listen to this piece of audio.
p99
aVWe have to remix it. He's got a great voice.
p100
aVIt's actually in the key of B flat.
p101
aVAnd have to do something with it."
p102
aVHundreds of remixes came back \u2014 lots of different attempts.
p103
aVOne stood out in particular.
p104
aVIt was done by a guy named Goose.
p105
aa(lp106
VRemix: \u266b I'm about to whip somebody's ass \u266b
p107
aa(lp108
V\u266b Oh, I'm about to whip somebody's ass \u266b
p109
aa(lp110
V\u266b Oh, if you don't leave me alone, \u266b
p111
aa(lp112
V\u266b You gonna have to send me home \u266b
p113
aa(lp114
V\u266b Cuz I'm about to whip somebody's ass \u266b
p115
aa(lp116
V\u266b I'm about to whip some \u266b \u2014
p117
aa(lp118
VZF: Great, so it was incredible.
p119
aVThat song \u2014 (Applause) Thank you.
p120
aVSo that song, somebody told me that it was at a baseball game
p121
aVin Kansas City.
p122
aVIn the end,
p123
aVit was one of the top downloads
p124
aVon a whole bunch of music streaming services.
p125
aVAnd so I said, "Let's put this together in an album."
p126
aVAnd the audience came together, and they designed an album cover.
p127
aVAnd I said, "If you put it all on this, I'm going to deliver it to him,
p128
aVif you can figure out who this person is,"
p129
aVbecause all I had was his name \u2014 Ray \u2014
p130
aVand this little piece of audio
p131
aVand the fact that his daughter was upset.
p132
aVIn two weeks, they found him.
p133
aVI received and email and it said,
p134
aV"Hi, I'm Ray.
p135
aVI heard you were looking for me."
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aVAnd I was like, "Yeah, Ray.
p138
aVIt's been an interesting two weeks."
p139
aVAnd so I flew to St. Louis
p140
aVand met Ray,
p141
aVand he's a preacher \u2014
p142
aV(Laughter)
p143
aVamong other things.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo but anyways, here's the thing \u2014
p146
aVis it reminds me of this,
p147
aVwhich is a sign that you see in Amsterdam on every street corner.
p148
aVAnd it's sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual world.
p149
aVI look at this photo, and he seems really interested
p150
aVin what's going on with that button,
p151
aVbut it doesn't seem like he is really that interested in crossing the street.
p152
aV(Laughter)
p153
aVAnd it makes me think of this.
p154
aVOn street corners everywhere, people are looking at their cell phones,
p155
aVand it's easy to dismiss this
p156
aVas some sort of bad trend
p157
aVin human culture.
p158
aVBut the truth is
p159
aVlife is being lived there.
p160
aVWhen they smile \u2014
p161
aVright, you've seen people stop \u2014
p162
aVall of a sudden, life is being lived there,
p163
aVsomewhere up in that weird, dense network.
p164
aVAnd this is it, right, to feel and be felt.
p165
aVIt's the fundamental force
p166
aVthat we're all after.
p167
aVWe can build all sorts of environments
p168
aVto make it a little bit easier,
p169
aVbut ultimately, what we're trying to do
p170
aVis really connect with one other person.
p171
aVAnd that's not always going to happen in physical spaces.
p172
aVIt's also going to now happen in virtual spaces,
p173
aVand we have to get better at figuring that out.
p174
aVI think, of the people that build all this technology in the network,
p175
aVa lot of them aren't very good
p176
aVat connecting with people.
p177
aVThis is kind of like something I used to do
p178
aVin third grade.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VSo here's a series of projects
p183
aVover the last few years
p184
aVwhere I've been inspired by trying to figure out
p185
aVhow to really facilitate close connection.
p186
aVSometimes they're very, very simple things.
p187
aVA Childhood Walk, which is a project
p188
aVwhere I ask people to remember a walk
p189
aVthat they used to take as a child over and over again
p190
aVthat was sort of meaningless \u2014
p191
aVlike on the route to the bus stop, to a neighbor's house,
p192
aVand take it inside of Google Streetview.
p193
aVAnd I promise you,
p194
aVif you take that walk inside Google Streetview,
p195
aVyou come to a moment
p196
aVwhere something comes back
p197
aVand hits you in the face.
p198
aVAnd I collected those moments \u2014
p199
aVthe photos inside Google Streetview
p200
aVand the memories, specifically.
p201
aV"Our conversation started with me saying, 'I'm bored,'
p202
aVand her replying, 'When I'm bored I eat pretzels.'
p203
aVI remember this distinctly because it came up a lot."
p204
aV"Right after he told me and my brother
p205
aVhe was going to be separating from my mom,
p206
aVI remember walking to a convenience store
p207
aVand getting a cherry cola."
p208
aV"They used some of the morbidly artist footage,
p209
aVa close-up of Chad's shoes in the middle of the highway.
p210
aVI guess the shoes came off when he was hit.
p211
aVHe slept over at my house once, and he left his pillow.
p212
aVIt had 'Chad' written in magic marker on it.
p213
aVHe died long after he left the pillow at my house,
p214
aVbut we never got around to returning it."
p215
aa(lp216
VSometimes they're a little bit more abstract.
p217
aVThis is Pain Pack.
p218
aVRight after September 11th, last year,
p219
aVI was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it,
p220
aVthe way that we excise it from our bodies.
p221
aVSo what I did is I opened up a hotline \u2014
p222
aVa hotline where people could leave voicemails of their pain,
p223
aVnot necessarily related to that event.
p224
aVAnd people called in and left messages like this.
p225
aa(lp226
VRecording: Okay, here's something.
p227
aVI'm not alone,
p228
aVand I am loved.
p229
aVI'm really fortunate.
p230
aVBut sometimes I feel really lonely.
p231
aVAnd when I feel that way
p232
aVeven the smallest act of kindness
p233
aVcan make me cry.
p234
aVLike even people in convenience stores
p235
aVsaying, "Have a nice day,"
p236
aVwhen they're accidentally looking me in the eye.
p237
aa(lp238
VZF: So what I did was I took those voicemails,
p239
aVand with their permission, converted them to MP3s
p240
aVand distributed them to sound editors
p241
aVwho created short sounds
p242
aVusing just those voicemails.
p243
aVAnd those were then distributed to DJs
p244
aVwho have made hundreds of songs
p245
aVusing that source material.
p246
aV(Music)
p247
aVWe don't have time to play much of it.
p248
aVYou can look at it online.
p249
aa(lp250
V"From 52 to 48 with love"
p251
aVwas a project around the time of the last election cycle,
p252
aVwhere McCain and Obama both,
p253
aVin their speeches after the election, talked about reconciliation,
p254
aVand I was like, "What the hell
p255
aVdoes that look like?"
p256
aVSo I thought, "Well let's just give it a try.
p257
aVLet's have people hold up signs about reconciliation."
p258
aVAnd so some really nice things came together.
p259
aV"I voted blue. I voted red.
p260
aVTogether, for our future."
p261
aVThese are very, very cute little things right.
p262
aVSome came from the winning party.
p263
aV"Dear 48, I promise to listen to you, to fight for you, to respect you always."
p264
aVSome came from the party who had just lost.
p265
aV"From a 48 to a 52, may your party's leadership be as classy as you,
p266
aVbut I doubt it."
p267
aVBut the truth was that as this start becoming popular,
p268
aVa couple rightwing blogs and some message boards
p269
aVapparently found it to be a little patronizing,
p270
aVwhich I could also see.
p271
aVAnd so I started getting amazing amounts of hate mail,
p272
aVdeath threats even.
p273
aVAnd one guy in particular kept on writing me these pretty awful messages,
p274
aVand he was dressed as Batman.
p275
aVAnd he said, "I'm dressed as Batman to hide my identity."
p276
aVJust in case I thought the real Batman
p277
aVwas coming after me;
p278
aVwhich actually made me feel a little better \u2014
p279
aVlike, "Phew, it's not him."
p280
aa(lp281
VSo what I did \u2014
p282
aVunfortunately, I was harboring all this kind of
p283
aVawful experience and this pain inside of me,
p284
aVand it started to eat away at my psyche.
p285
aVAnd I was protecting the project from it, I realized. I was protecting it \u2014
p286
aVI didn't want this special, little group of photographs
p287
aVto get sullied in some way.
p288
aVSo what I did, I took all those emails,
p289
aVand I put them together into something called Angrigami,
p290
aVwhich was an origami template
p291
aVmade out of this sort of vile stuff.
p292
aVAnd I asked people to send me beautiful things
p293
aVmade out of the Angrigami.
p294
aV(Laughter)
p295
aVBut this was the emotional moment.
p296
aVOne of my viewer's uncles died on a particular day
p297
aVand he chose to commemorate it with a piece of hate.
p298
aVIt's amazing.
p299
aa(lp300
VThe last thing I'm going to tell you about is a series of projects
p301
aVcalled Songs You Already Know,
p302
aVwhere the idea was,
p303
aVI was trying to figure out to address
p304
aVparticular kinds of emotions with group projects.
p305
aVSo one of them was fairly straightforward.
p306
aVA guy said that his daughter got scared at night
p307
aVand could I write a song for her, his daughter.
p308
aVAnd I said, "Oh yeah,
p309
aVI'll try to write a mantra that she can sing to herself
p310
aVto help herself go to sleep."
p311
aVAnd this was "Scared."
p312
aa(lp313
V(Video) \u266b This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something \u266b
p314
aa(lp315
V\u266b I don't know why but it helps me get over it \u266b
p316
aa(lp317
V\u266b The words of the song just move me along \u266b
p318
aa(lp319
V\u266b And somehow I get over it \u266b
p320
aa(lp321
V\u266b At least I don't suck at life \u266b
p322
aa(lp323
V\u266b I keep on trying despite \u266b
p324
aa(lp325
V\u266b At least I don't suck at life \u266b
p326
aa(lp327
V\u266b I keep on trying despite \u266b
p328
aa(lp329
V\u266b This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something \u266b
p330
aa(lp331
VOkay, so I wrote that song, right. Thank you.
p332
aVSo the nice thing was is he walked by his daughter's room at some point,
p333
aVand she actually was singing that song to herself.
p334
aVSo I was like, "Awesome. This is great."
p335
aa(lp336
VAnd then I got this email. And there's a little bit of a back story to this.
p337
aVAnd I don't have much time.
p338
aVBut the idea was that at one point
p339
aVI did a project called Facebook Me Equals You,
p340
aVwhere I wanted to experience what it was like
p341
aVto live as another person.
p342
aVSo I asked for people's usernames and passwords to be sent to me.
p343
aVAnd I got a lot, like 30 in a half an hour.
p344
aVAnd I shut that part down.
p345
aVAnd I chose two people to be,
p346
aVand I asked them to send me descriptions
p347
aVof how to act as them on Facebook.
p348
aVOne person sent me a very detailed description;
p349
aVthe other person didn't.
p350
aVAnd the person who didn't, it turned out,
p351
aVhad just moved to a new city and taken on a new job.
p352
aVSo, you know, people were writing me and saying, "How's your new job?"
p353
aVI was like, "I don't know.
p354
aVDidn't know I had one."
p355
aa(lp356
VBut anyway, this same person, Laura,
p357
aVended up emailing me a little bit after that project.
p358
aVAnd I felt badly for not having done a good job.
p359
aVAnd she said, "I'm really anxious, I just moved to a new town, I have this new job,
p360
aVand I've just had this incredible amount of anxiety."
p361
aVSo she had seen the "Scared" song and wondered if I could do something.
p362
aVSo I asked her, "What does it feel like when you feel this way?"
p363
aVAnd she wrote a sort of descriptive set
p364
aVof what it felt like to have had this anxiety.
p365
aVAnd so what I decided to do.
p366
aVI said, "Okay, I'll think about it."
p367
aVAnd so quietly in the background, I started sending people this.
p368
aa(lp369
V(Audio) \u266b Hey \u266b
p370
aa(lp371
V\u266b You're okay \u266b
p372
aa(lp373
V\u266b You'll be fine \u266b
p374
aa(lp375
VSo I asked people
p376
aVwhether they had basic audio capabilities,
p377
aVjust so they could sing along to the song with headphones on,
p378
aVso I could just get their voices back.
p379
aVAnd this is the kind of thing that I got back.
p380
aa(lp381
VRecording: \u266b Hey \u266b
p382
aa(lp383
V\u266b You're okay \u266b
p384
aa(lp385
V\u266b You'll be fine \u266b
p386
aa(lp387
VZF: So that's one of the better ones, really.
p388
aVBut what's awesome is, as I started getting more and more and more of them,
p389
aVall of a sudden I had 30, 40 voices from around the world.
p390
aVAnd when you put them together, something magical happens,
p391
aVsomething absolutely incredible happens,
p392
aVand all of a sudden I get a chorus from around the world.
p393
aVAnd what was really great is, I'm putting all this work together in the background,
p394
aVand Laura sent me a follow-up email because a good month had passed by.
p395
aVAnd she said, "I know you've forgotten about me.
p396
aVI just want to say thanks for even considering it."
p397
aVAnd then a few days later I sent her this.
p398
aa(lp399
V(Audio) \u266b Right now, it feels like I forgot to turn the light on \u266b
p400
aa(lp401
V\u266b And things that looked so good yesterday \u266b
p402
aa(lp403
V\u266b are now shades of gray \u266b
p404
aa(lp405
V\u266b And it seems like the world is spinning \u266b
p406
aa(lp407
V\u266b while I'm standing still \u266b
p408
aa(lp409
V\u266b Or maybe I am spinning I can't tell \u266b
p410
aa(lp411
V\u266b And then you say \u266b
p412
aa(lp413
V\u266b Hey \u266b
p414
aa(lp415
V\u266b You're okay \u266b
p416
aa(lp417
V\u266b You'll be fine \u266b
p418
aa(lp419
V\u266b Just breathe \u266b
p420
aa(lp421
V\u266b And now the words sing \u266b
p422
aa(lp423
V\u266b Hey \u266b
p424
aa(lp425
V\u266b You're okay \u266b
p426
aa(lp427
V\u266b You'll be fine \u266b
p428
aa(lp429
V\u266b Just breathe \u266b
p430
aa(lp431
V\u266b Now everybody sings \u266b
p432
aa(lp433
V\u266b Hey \u266b
p434
aa(lp435
V\u266b You're okay \u266b
p436
aa(lp437
V\u266b You'll be fine \u266b
p438
aa(lp439
V\u266b Just breathe \u266b
p440
aa(lp441
V\u266b Hey \u266b
p442
aa(lp443
V\u266b You're okay \u266b
p444
aa(lp445
V\u266b You'll be fine \u266b
p446
aa(lp447
V\u266b Just breathe \u266b

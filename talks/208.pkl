V"Jó napot, pacák" Which, as somebody here must surely know,
p5
aVmeans "What's up, guys?" in Magyar,
p6
aVthat peculiar non-Indo-European language spoken by Hungarians
p7
aVfor which, given the fact that cognitive diversity is
p8
aVat least as threatened as biodiversity on this planet,
p9
aVfew would have imagined much of a future even a century or two ago.
p10
aVBut there it is: "Jó napot, pacák"
p11
aVI said somebody here must surely know, because
p12
aVdespite the fact that there aren't that many Hungarians to begin with,
p13
aVand the further fact that, so far as I know, there's not a drop
p14
aVof Hungarian blood in my veins, at every critical juncture of my life
p15
aVthere has been a Hungarian friend or mentor there beside me.
p16
aVI even have dreams that take place in landscapes
p17
aVI recognize as the landscapes of Hungarian films,
p18
aVespecially the early movies of Miklos Jancso.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo, how do I explain this mysterious affinity?
p21
aVMaybe it's because my native state of South Carolina,
p22
aVwhich is not much smaller than present-day Hungary,
p23
aVonce imagined a future for itself as an independent country.
p24
aVAnd as a consequence of that presumption,
p25
aVmy hometown was burned to the ground by an invading army,
p26
aVan experience that has befallen many a Hungarian town and village
p27
aVthroughout its long and troubled history.
p28
aVOr maybe it's because when I was a teenager back in the '50s,
p29
aVmy uncle Henry \u2014 having denounced the Ku Klux Klan
p30
aVand been bombed for his trouble and had crosses burned in his yard,
p31
aVliving under death threat \u2014 took his wife and children to Massachusetts for safety
p32
aVand went back to South Carolina to face down the Klan alone.
p33
aVThat was a very Hungarian thing to do,
p34
aVas anyone will attest who remembers 1956.
p35
aVAnd of course, from time to time Hungarians
p36
aVhave invented their own equivalent of the Klan.
p37
aa(lp38
VWell, it seems to me that this Hungarian presence in my life
p39
aVis difficult to account for, but ultimately I ascribe it to an admiration
p40
aVfor people with a complex moral awareness,
p41
aVwith a heritage of guilt and defeat matched by defiance and bravado.
p42
aVIt's not a typical mindset for most Americans,
p43
aVbut it is perforce typical of virtually all Hungarians.
p44
aVSo, "Jó napot, pacák!"
p45
aa(lp46
VI went back to South Carolina after some 15 years amid the alien corn
p47
aVat the tail end of the 1960s,
p48
aVwith the reckless condescension of that era
p49
aVthinking I would save my people.
p50
aVNever mind the fact that they were slow to acknowledge they needed saving.
p51
aVI labored in that vineyard for a quarter century before
p52
aVmaking my way to a little kingdom of the just in upstate South Carolina,
p53
aVa Methodist-affiliated institution of higher learning called Wofford College.
p54
aVI knew nothing about Wofford
p55
aVand even less about Methodism,
p56
aVbut I was reassured on the first day that I taught at Wofford College
p57
aVto find, among the auditors in my classroom,
p58
aVa 90-year-old Hungarian, surrounded by a bevy of middle-aged European women
p59
aVwho seemed to function as an entourage of Rhinemaidens.
p60
aa(lp61
VHis name was Sandor Teszler.
p62
aVHe was a puckish widower whose wife and children were dead
p63
aVand whose grandchildren lived far away.
p64
aVIn appearance, he resembled Mahatma Gandhi,
p65
aVminus the loincloth, plus orthopedic boots.
p66
aVHe had been born in 1903 in the provinces
p67
aVof the old Austro-Hungarian Empire,
p68
aVin what later would become Yugoslavia.
p69
aVHe was ostracized as a child, not because he was a Jew \u2014
p70
aVhis parents weren't very religious anyhow \u2014
p71
aVbut because he had been born with two club feet,
p72
aVa condition which, in those days, required institutionalization
p73
aVand a succession of painful operations between the ages of one and 11.
p74
aVHe went to the commercial business high school as a young man
p75
aVin Budapest, and there he was as smart as he was modest
p76
aVand he enjoyed a considerable success. And after graduation
p77
aVwhen he went into textile engineering, the success continued.
p78
aVHe built one plant after another.
p79
aVHe married and had two sons. He had friends in high places who
p80
aVassured him that he was of great value to the economy.
p81
aa(lp82
VOnce, as he had left instructions to have done,
p83
aVhe was summoned in the middle of the night by the night watchman at one of his plants.
p84
aVThe night watchman had caught an employee who was stealing socks \u2014
p85
aVit was a hosiery mill, and he simply backed a truck up to the loading dock
p86
aVand was shoveling in mountains of socks.
p87
aVMr. Teszler went down to the plant and confronted the thief and said,
p88
aV"But why do you steal from me? If you need money you have only to ask."
p89
aVThe night watchman, seeing how things were going and waxing indignant,
p90
aVsaid, "Well, we're going to call the police, aren't we?"
p91
aVBut Mr. Teszler answered, "No, that will not be necessary.
p92
aVHe will not steal from us again."
p93
aa(lp94
VWell, maybe he was too trusting, because he stayed where he was
p95
aVlong after the Nazi Anschluss in Austria
p96
aVand even after the arrests and deportations began in Budapest.
p97
aVHe took the simple precaution of having cyanide capsules placed in lockets
p98
aVthat could be worn about the necks of himself and his family.
p99
aVAnd then one day, it happened: he and his family were arrested
p100
aVand they were taken to a death house on the Danube.
p101
aVIn those early days of the Final Solution, it was handcrafted brutality;
p102
aVpeople were beaten to death and their bodies tossed into the river.
p103
aVBut none who entered that death house had ever come out alive.
p104
aVAnd in a twist you would not believe in a Steven Spielberg film \u2014
p105
aVthe Gauleiter who was overseeing this brutal beating was the very same thief
p106
aVwho had stolen socks from Mr. Teszler's hosiery mill.
p107
aVIt was a brutal beating. And midway through that brutality,
p108
aVone of Mr. Teszler's sons, Andrew, looked up and said,
p109
aV"Is it time to take the capsule now, Papa?"
p110
aVAnd the Gauleiter, who afterwards vanishes from this story,
p111
aVleaned down and whispered into Mr. Teszler's ear,
p112
aV"No, do not take the capsule. Help is on the way."
p113
aVAnd then resumed the beating.
p114
aa(lp115
VBut help was on the way, and shortly afterwards
p116
aVa car arrived from the Swiss Embassy.
p117
aVThey were spirited to safety. They were reclassified as Yugoslav citizens
p118
aVand they managed to stay one step ahead of their pursuers
p119
aVfor the duration of the War, surviving burnings and bombings
p120
aVand, at the end of the War, arrest by the Soviets.
p121
aVProbably, Mr. Teszler had gotten some money into Swiss bank accounts
p122
aVbecause he managed to take his family first to Great Britain,
p123
aVthen to Long Island and then to the center of the textile industry in the American South.
p124
aVWhich, as chance would have it, was Spartanburg, South Carolina,
p125
aVthe location of Wofford College.
p126
aVAnd there, Mr. Teszler began all over again and once again achieved immense success,
p127
aVespecially after he invented the process
p128
aVfor manufacturing a new fabric called double-knit.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd then in the late 1950s, in the aftermath of Brown v. Board of Education,
p131
aVwhen the Klan was resurgent all over the South,
p132
aVMr. Teszler said, "I have heard this talk before."
p133
aVAnd he called his top assistant to him and asked,
p134
aV"Where would you say, in this region, racism is most virulent?"
p135
aV"Well, I don't rightly know, Mr. Teszler. I reckon that would be Kings Mountain."
p136
aV"Good. Buy us some land in Kings Mountain
p137
aVand announce we are going to build a major plant there."
p138
aVThe man did as he was told, and shortly afterwards,
p139
aVMr. Teszler received a visit from the white mayor of Kings Mountain.
p140
aVNow, you should know that at that time,
p141
aVthe textile industry in the South was notoriously segregated.
p142
aVThe white mayor visited Mr. Teszler and said,
p143
aV"Mr. Teszler, I trust you\u2019re going to be hiring a lot of white workers."
p144
aVMr. Teszler told him, "You bring me the best workers that you can find,
p145
aVand if they are good enough, I will hire them."
p146
aVHe also received a visit from the leader of the black community,
p147
aVa minister, who said, "Mr. Teszler, I sure hope you're going to
p148
aVhire some black workers for this new plant of yours."
p149
aVHe got the same answer: "You bring the best workers that you can find,
p150
aVand if they are good enough, I will hire them."
p151
aVAs it happens, the black minister did his job better than the white mayor,
p152
aVbut that's neither here or there.
p153
aVMr. Teszler hired 16 men: eight white, eight black.
p154
aa(lp155
VThey were to be his seed group, his future foremen.
p156
aVHe had installed the heavy equipment for his new process
p157
aVin an abandoned store in the vicinity of Kings Mountain,
p158
aVand for two months these 16 men would live and work together,
p159
aVmastering the new process.
p160
aVHe gathered them together after an initial tour of that facility
p161
aVand he asked if there were any questions.
p162
aVThere was hemming and hawing and shuffling of feet,
p163
aVand then one of the white workers stepped forward and said,
p164
aV"Well, yeah. We\u2019ve looked at this place and there's only one place to sleep,
p165
aVthere's only one place to eat, there's only one bathroom,
p166
aVthere's only one water fountain. Is this plant going to be integrated or what?"
p167
aVMr. Teszler said, "You are being paid twice the wages of any other textile workers in this region
p168
aVand this is how we do business. Do you have any other questions?"
p169
aV"No, I reckon I don't."
p170
aVAnd two months later when the main plant opened
p171
aVand hundreds of new workers, white and black,
p172
aVpoured in to see the facility for the first time,
p173
aVthey were met by the 16 foremen, white and black, standing shoulder to shoulder.
p174
aVThey toured the facility and were asked if there were any questions, and
p175
aVinevitably the same question arose:
p176
aV"Is this plant integrated or what?"
p177
aVAnd one of the white foremen stepped forward and said,
p178
aV"You are being paid twice the wages of any other workers
p179
aVin this industry in this region and this is how we do business.
p180
aVDo you have any other questions?"
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd there were none. In one fell swoop,
p183
aVMr. Teszler had integrated the textile industry in that part of the South.
p184
aVIt was an achievement worthy of Mahatma Gandhi,
p185
aVconducted with the shrewdness of a lawyer and the idealism of a saint.
p186
aVIn his eighties, Mr. Teszler, having retired from the textile industry,
p187
aVadopted Wofford College,
p188
aVauditing courses every semester,
p189
aVand because he had a tendency to kiss anything that moved,
p190
aVbecoming affectionately known as "Opi" \u2014 which is Magyar for grandfather \u2014
p191
aVby all and sundry. Before I got there, the library of the college
p192
aVhad been named for Mr. Teszler, and after I arrived in 1993,
p193
aVthe faculty decided to honor itself by naming Mr. Teszler Professor of the College \u2014
p194
aVpartly because at that point he had already taken
p195
aVall of the courses in the catalog, but mainly because
p196
aVhe was so conspicuously wiser than any one of us.
p197
aVTo me, it was immensely reassuring that the presiding spirit
p198
aVof this little Methodist college in upstate South Carolina
p199
aVwas a Holocaust survivor from Central Europe.
p200
aVWise he was, indeed, but he also had a wonderful sense of humor.
p201
aVAnd once for an interdisciplinary class,
p202
aVI was screening the opening segment of Ingmar Bergman's "The Seventh Seal."
p203
aVAs the medieval knight Antonius Block returns from the wild goose chase
p204
aVof the Crusades and arrives on the rocky shore of Sweden,
p205
aVonly to find the specter of death waiting for him,
p206
aVMr. Teszler sat in the dark with his fellow students. And
p207
aVas death opened his cloak to embrace the knight
p208
aVin a ghastly embrace, I heard Mr. Teszler's tremulous voice:
p209
aV"Uh oh," he said, "This doesn't look so good." (Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
VBut it was music that was his greatest passion, especially opera.
p212
aVAnd on the first occasion that I visited his house, he gave me
p213
aVhonor of deciding what piece of music we would listen to.
p214
aVAnd I delighted him by rejecting "Cavalleria Rusticana"
p215
aVin favor of Bela Bartok's "Bluebeard's Castle."
p216
aVI love Bartok's music, as did Mr. Teszler,
p217
aVand he had virtually every recording of Bartok's music ever issued.
p218
aVAnd it was at his house that I heard for the first time
p219
aVBartok's Third Piano Concerto and learned from
p220
aVMr. Teszler that it had been composed in nearby Asheville, North Carolina
p221
aVin the last year of the composer's life.
p222
aVHe was dying of leukemia and he knew it,
p223
aVand he dedicated this concerto to his wife,
p224
aVDita, who was herself a concert pianist.
p225
aVAnd into the slow, second movement, marked "adagio religioso,"
p226
aVhe incorporated the sounds of birdsong that he heard
p227
aVoutside his window in what he knew would be his last spring;
p228
aVhe was imagining a future for her in which he would play no part.
p229
aVAnd clearly this composition is his final statement to her \u2014
p230
aVit was first performed after his death \u2014
p231
aVand through her to the world.
p232
aVAnd just as clearly, it is saying, "It's okay. It was all so beautiful.
p233
aVWhenever you hear this, I will be there."
p234
aa(lp235
VIt was only after Mr. Teszler's death that I learned
p236
aVthat the marker on the grave of Bela Bartok in Hartsdale, New York
p237
aVwas paid for by Sandor Teszler. "Jó napot, Bela!"
p238
aVNot long before Mr. Teszler\u2019s own death at the age of 97,
p239
aVhe heard me hold forth on human iniquity.
p240
aVI delivered a lecture in which I described history
p241
aVas, on the whole, a tidal wave of human suffering and brutality,
p242
aVand Mr. Teszler came up to me afterwards with gentle reproach and said,
p243
aV"You know, Doctor, human beings are fundamentally good."
p244
aVAnd I made a vow to myself, then and there,
p245
aVthat if this man who had such cause to think otherwise
p246
aVhad reached that conclusion,
p247
aVI would not presume to differ until he released me from my vow.
p248
aVAnd now he's dead, so I'm stuck with my vow.
p249
aV"Jó napot, Sandor!"
p250
aa(lp251
VI thought my skein of Hungarian mentors had come to an end,
p252
aVbut almost immediately I met Francis Robicsek, a Hungarian doctor \u2014
p253
aVactually a heart surgeon in Charlotte, North Carolina, then in his late seventies \u2014
p254
aVwho had been a pioneer in open-heart surgery,
p255
aVand, tinkering away in his garage behind his house,
p256
aVhad invented many of the devices that are standard parts of those procedures.
p257
aVHe's also a prodigious art collector, beginning as an intern in Budapest
p258
aVby collecting 16th- and 17th-century Dutch art and Hungarian painting,
p259
aVand when he came to this country moving on to Spanish colonial art,
p260
aVRussian icons and finally Mayan ceramics.
p261
aVHe's the author of seven books, six of them on Mayan ceramics.
p262
aVIt was he who broke the Mayan codex, enabling scholars to relate
p263
aVthe pictographs on Mayan ceramics to the hieroglyphs of the Mayan script.
p264
aa(lp265
VOn the occasion of my first visit, we toured his house
p266
aVand we saw hundreds of works of museum quality,
p267
aVand then we paused in front of a closed door and Dr. Robicsek said,
p268
aVwith obvious pride, "Now for the piece De resistance."
p269
aVAnd he opened the door and we walked into a
p270
aVwindowless 20-by-20-foot room with shelves from floor to ceiling, and
p271
aVcrammed on every shelf his collection of Mayan ceramics.
p272
aVNow, I know absolutely nothing about Mayan ceramics,
p273
aVbut I wanted to be as ingratiating as possible so I said,
p274
aV"But Dr. Robicsek, this is absolutely dazzling."
p275
aV"Yes," he said. "That is what the Louvre said.
p276
aVThey would not leave me alone until I let them have a piece,
p277
aVbut it was not a good one." (Laughter)
p278
aa(lp279
VWell, it occurred to me that I should invite Dr. Robicsek
p280
aVto lecture at Wofford College on \u2014 what else?
p281
aV\u2014 Leonardo da Vinci. And further, I should invite him to meet
p282
aVmy oldest trustee, who had majored in French history at Yale
p283
aVsome 70-odd years before and, at 89, still ruled the world's
p284
aVlargest privately owned textile empire with an iron hand.
p285
aVHis name is Roger Milliken. And Mr. Milliken agreed,
p286
aVand Dr. Robicsek agreed. And Dr. Robicsek visited
p287
aVand delivered the lecture and it was a dazzling success.
p288
aVAnd afterwards we convened at the President's House with Dr. Robicsek
p289
aVon one hand, Mr. Milliken on the other.
p290
aVAnd it was only at that moment, as we were sitting down to dinner,
p291
aVthat I recognized the enormity of the risk I had created,
p292
aVbecause to bring these two titans, these two masters of the universe
p293
aVtogether \u2014 it was like introducing Mothra to Godzilla over the skyline of Tokyo.
p294
aVIf they didn't like each other, we could all get trampled to death.
p295
aa(lp296
VBut they did, they did like each other.
p297
aVThey got along famously until the very end of the meal,
p298
aVand then they got into a furious argument.
p299
aVAnd what they were arguing about was this:
p300
aVwhether the second Harry Potter movie was as good as the first. (Laughter)
p301
aVMr. Milliken said it was not. Dr. Robicsek disagreed.
p302
aVI was still trying to take in the notion that these titans,
p303
aVthese masters of the universe, in their spare time watch Harry Potter movies,
p304
aVwhen Mr. Milliken thought he would win the argument by saying,
p305
aV"You just think it's so good because you didn't read the book."
p306
aVAnd Dr. Robicsek reeled back in his chair, but quickly gathered his wits,
p307
aVleaned forward and said, "Well, that is true, but I'll bet you went
p308
aVto the movie with a grandchild." "Well, yes, I did," conceded Mr. Milliken.
p309
aV"Aha!" said Dr. Robicsek. "I went to the movie all by myself." (Laughter) (Applause)
p310
aa(lp311
VAnd I realized, in this moment of revelation,
p312
aVthat what these two men were revealing was the secret
p313
aVof their extraordinary success, each in his own right.
p314
aVAnd it lay precisely in that insatiable curiosity,
p315
aVthat irrepressible desire to know, no matter what the subject,
p316
aVno matter what the cost,
p317
aVeven at a time when the keepers of the Doomsday Clock
p318
aVare willing to bet even money that the human race won't be around
p319
aVto imagine anything in the year 2100, a scant 93 years from now.
p320
aV"Live each day as if it is your last," said Mahatma Gandhi.
p321
aV"Learn as if you'll live forever."
p322
aVThis is what I'm passionate about. It is precisely this.
p323
aVIt is this inextinguishable, undaunted appetite for learning and experience,
p324
aVno matter how risible, no matter how esoteric,
p325
aVno matter how seditious it might seem.
p326
aVThis defines the imagined futures of our fellow Hungarians \u2014
p327
aVRobicsek, Teszler and Bartok \u2014 as it does my own.
p328
aVAs it does, I suspect, that of everybody here.
p329
aa(lp330
VTo which I need only add, "Ez a mi munkank; es nem is keves."
p331
aVThis is our task; we know it will be hard.
p332
aV"Ez a mi munkank; es nem is keves. Jó napot, pacák!" (Applause)

VWhen I was a child growing up in Maine,
p5
aVone of my favorite things to do
p6
aVwas to look for sand dollars on the seashores of Maine,
p7
aVbecause my parents told me it would bring me luck.
p8
aVBut you know, these shells, they're hard to find.
p9
aVThey're covered in sand, they're difficult to see.
p10
aVHowever, over time, I got used to looking for them.
p11
aVI started seeing shapes
p12
aVand patterns that helped me to collect them.
p13
aa(lp14
VThis grew into a passion for finding things,
p15
aVa love for the past and archaeology.
p16
aVAnd eventually, when I started studying Egyptology,
p17
aVI realized that seeing with my naked eyes alone wasn't enough.
p18
aVBecause all of the sudden, in Egypt,
p19
aVmy beach had grown from a tiny beach in Maine
p20
aVto one eight hundred miles long,
p21
aVnext to the Nile.
p22
aVAnd my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities.
p23
aVThis is really what brought me to using satellite imagery.
p24
aVFor trying to map the past, I knew that I had to see differently.
p25
aa(lp26
VSo I want to show you an example of how we see differently
p27
aVusing the infrared.
p28
aVThis is a site located in the eastern Egyptian delta
p29
aVcalled Mendes.
p30
aVAnd the site visibly appears brown,
p31
aVbut when we use the infrared
p32
aVand we process it, all of the sudden,
p33
aVusing false color,
p34
aVthe site appears as bright pink.
p35
aVWhat you are seeing
p36
aVare the actual chemical changes to the landscape
p37
aVcaused by the building materials and activities
p38
aVof the ancient Egyptians.
p39
aa(lp40
VWhat I want to share with you today
p41
aVis how we've used satellite data
p42
aVto find an ancient Egyptian city,
p43
aVcalled Itjtawy,
p44
aVmissing for thousands of years.
p45
aVItjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital
p46
aVfor over four hundred years,
p47
aVat a period of time called the Middle Kingdom,
p48
aVabout four thousand years ago.
p49
aVThe site is located in the Faiyum of Egypt,
p50
aVand the site is really important,
p51
aVbecause in the Middle Kingdom there was this great renaissance
p52
aVfor ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.
p53
aVEgyptologists have always known the site of Itjtawy
p54
aVwas located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings who built it,
p55
aVindicated within the red circles here,
p56
aVbut somewhere within this massive flood plain.
p57
aVThis area is huge \u2014
p58
aVit's four miles by three miles in size.
p59
aVThe Nile used to flow right next to the city of Itjtawy,
p60
aVand as it shifted and changed and moved over time to the east,
p61
aVit covered over the city.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo, how do you find a buried city
p64
aVin a vast landscape?
p65
aVFinding it randomly would be the equivalent
p66
aVof locating a needle in a haystack,
p67
aVblindfolded, wearing baseball mitts.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VSo what we did is we used NASA topography data
p72
aVto map out the landscape, very subtle changes.
p73
aVWe started to be able to see where the Nile used to flow.
p74
aVBut you can see in more detail, and even more interesting,
p75
aVthis very slight raised area
p76
aVseen within the circle up here
p77
aVwhich we thought could possibly be the location of the city of Itjtawy.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo we collaborated with Egyptian scientists
p80
aVto do coring work, which you see here.
p81
aVWhen I say coring, it's like ice coring,
p82
aVbut instead of layers of climate change,
p83
aVyou're looking for layers of human occupation.
p84
aVAnd, five meters down,
p85
aVunderneath a thick layer of mud,
p86
aVwe found a dense layer of pottery.
p87
aVWhat this shows is that at this possible location of Itjtawy,
p88
aVfive meters down,
p89
aVwe have a layer of occupation for several hundred years,
p90
aVdating to the Middle Kingdom,
p91
aVdating to the exact period of time we think Itjtawy is.
p92
aVWe also found work stone \u2014
p93
aVcarnelian, quartz and agate
p94
aVthat shows that there was a jeweler's workshop here.
p95
aVThese might not look like much,
p96
aVbut when you think about the most common stones
p97
aVused in jewelry from the Middle Kingdom,
p98
aVthese are the stones that were used.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo, we have a dense layer of occupation
p101
aVdating to the Middle Kingdom at this site.
p102
aVWe also have evidence of an elite jeweler's workshop,
p103
aVshowing that whatever was there was a very important city.
p104
aVNo Itjtawy was here yet,
p105
aVbut we're going to be returning to the site
p106
aVin the near future to map it out.
p107
aVAnd even more importantly,
p108
aVwe have funding to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology
p109
aVso they can be the ones making great discoveries as well.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo I wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Kingdom \u2014
p112
aVit was probably written at the city of Itjtawy
p113
aVfour thousand years ago.
p114
aV"Sharing knowledge is the greatest of all callings.
p115
aVThere's nothing like it in the land."
p116
aVSo as it turns out, TED was not founded in 1984 AD.
p117
aa(lp118
V(Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
VMaking ideas actually started in 1984 BC
p121
aVat a not-lost-for-long city, found from above.
p122
aVIt certainly puts finding seashells by the seashore in perspective.
p123
aa(lp124
VThank you very much.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Applause)
p127
aa(lp128
VThank you.

Her goal: to make the world&#39;s invisible history visible once again.</p><p>In Egypt, Parcak&#39;s techniques have helped locate 17 potential pyramids, and more than 3,100 potential forgotten settlements. She&#39;s also made discoveries in the Viking world (as seen in the PBS Nova special,&nbsp;<em><a href=\\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/vikings-unearthed.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" onclick=\\"window.open(\'\',\'\',\'\');return false;\\">Vikings Unearthed</a>)</em>&nbsp;and across the Roman Empire (as shown in the BBC documentary,&nbsp;<em><a href=\\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pc063\\" target=\\"_blank\\" onclick=\\"window.open(\'\',\'\',\'\');return false;\\">Rome&rsquo;s Lost Empire</a>).</em>&nbsp;Her methods also offer a new way to understand how ancient sites are being affected by looting and urban development. By satellite-mapping Egypt and comparing sites over time, Parcak has noted a 1,000 percent increase in looting since 2009. It&rsquo;s likely that millions of dollars worth of artifacts are stolen each year. Parcak hopes that, through her work, unknown sites can be protected to preserve our rich, vibrant history.</p><p>As the winner of the 2016 TED Prize, Parcak asked the world to help in this important work. By building a citizen science platform for archaeology,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.globalxplorer.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">GlobalXplorer.org</a>, Parcak invites anyone with an internet connection to help find the next potential looting pit or unknown tomb.

"<p>There may be hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of undiscovered ancient sites across the globe. Sarah Parcak wants to locate them. As a space archaeologist, she analyzes high-resolution imagery collected by satellites in order to identify subtle changes to the Earth&rsquo;s surface that might signal man-made features hidden from view. A TED Senior Fellow and a <a href=\\"http://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/bios/sarah-parcak/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" onclick=\\"window.open(\'\',\'\',\'\');return false;\\">National Geographic Explorer</a>, Parcak wrote the <a href=\\"http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12033&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com/Satellite-Remote-Sensing-Archaeology-Parcak/dp/0415448786\\" onclick=\\"window.open(\'\',\'\',\'\');return false;\\">textbook on satellite archaeology</a> and founded the Laboratory for Global Observation at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Her goal: to make the world&#39;s invisible history visible once again.</p><p>In Egypt, Parcak&#39;s techniques have helped locate 17 potential pyramids, and more than 3,100 potential forgotten settlements. She&#39;s also made discoveries in the Viking world (as seen in the PBS Nova special,&nbsp;<em><a href=\\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/vikings-unearthed.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" onclick=\\"window.open(\'\',\'\',\'\');return false;\\">Vikings Unearthed</a>)</em>&nbsp;and across the Roman Empire (as shown in the BBC documentary,&nbsp;<em><a href=\\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pc063\\" target=\\"_blank\\" onclick=\\"window.open(\'\',\'\',\'\');return false;\\">Rome&rsquo;s Lost Empire</a>).</em>&nbsp;Her methods also offer a new way to understand how ancient sites are being affected by looting and urban development. By satellite-mapping Egypt and comparing sites over time, Parcak has noted a 1,000 percent increase in looting since 2009. It&rsquo;s likely that millions of dollars worth of artifacts are stolen each year. Parcak hopes that, through her work, unknown sites can be protected to preserve our rich, vibrant history.</p><p>As the winner of the 2016 TED Prize, Parcak asked the world to help in this important work. By building a citizen science platform for archaeology,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.globalxplorer.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">GlobalXplorer.org</a>, Parcak invites anyone with an internet connection to help find the next potential looting pit or unknown tomb. GlobalXplorer launched on January 30, 2017, with volunteers working together to map Peru. Other countries will follow, as the platform democratizes discovery and makes satellite-mapping rapid and cost-effective.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>", "slug": "sarah_parcak", "whotheyare": "Like a modern-day Indiana Jones, Sarah Parcak uses satellite images to locate lost ancient sites.

Perennial, 2015", "position": null, "blurb": "Marilyn Johnson is a delightful writer. She follows the story of archaeologists working in different parts of the world, and asks: Why do people do this? What guides people to travel to godforsaken places all over the world and spend all this time preparing to go into the field when the risk is so great and the payoff is often so low? The answer: all of us are driven by our passion.

Cline \\r\\nPrinceton University Press, 2015", "position": null, "blurb": "In 1177 B.C., many different ancient cultures thrived in the cradle of civilization. It was the Bronze Age, and all was well -- art and architecture were at a peak, knowledge was highly valued, and economies boomed. But then, a group called the \'Sea Peoples\' invaded Egypt, and everything turned around. The Egyptians fought them off, but their society was deeply weakened. With that vacuum of power and a major earthquake, civilizations started to fall -- and quickly.

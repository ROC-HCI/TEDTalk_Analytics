VSo, well, I do applied math,
p5
aVand this is a peculiar problem
p6
aVfor anyone who does applied math, is that
p7
aVwe are like management consultants.
p8
aVNo one knows what the hell we do.
p9
aVSo I am going to give you some \u2014 attempt today
p10
aVto try and explain to you what I do.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo, dancing is one of the most human of activities.
p13
aVWe delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers
p14
aVyou will see later on.
p15
aVNow, ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise
p16
aVand a high level of skill,
p17
aVand probably a level of initial suitability
p18
aVthat may well have a genetic component to it.
p19
aVNow, sadly, neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease
p20
aVgradually destroy this extraordinary ability,
p21
aVas it is doing to my friend Jan Stripling, who was
p22
aVa virtuoso ballet dancer in his time.
p23
aVSo great progress and treatment has been made over the years.
p24
aVHowever, there are 6.3 million people worldwide
p25
aVwho have the disease, and they have to live with
p26
aVincurable weakness, tremor, rigidity
p27
aVand the other symptoms that go along with the disease,
p28
aVso what we need are objective tools
p29
aVto detect the disease before it's too late.
p30
aVWe need to be able to measure progression objectively,
p31
aVand ultimately, the only way we're going to know
p32
aVwhen we actually have a cure is when we have
p33
aVan objective measure that can answer that for sure.
p34
aa(lp35
VBut frustratingly, with Parkinson's disease
p36
aVand other movement disorders, there are no biomarkers,
p37
aVso there's no simple blood test that you can do,
p38
aVand the best that we have is like
p39
aVthis 20-minute neurologist test.
p40
aVYou have to go to the clinic to do it. It's very, very costly,
p41
aVand that means that, outside the clinical trials,
p42
aVit's just never done. It's never done.
p43
aa(lp44
VBut what if patients could do this test at home?
p45
aVNow, that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic,
p46
aVand what if patients could do that test themselves, right?
p47
aVNo expensive staff time required.
p48
aVTakes about $300, by the way,
p49
aVin the neurologist's clinic to do it.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo what I want to propose to you as an unconventional way
p52
aVin which we can try to achieve this,
p53
aVbecause, you see, in one sense, at least,
p54
aVwe are all virtuosos like my friend Jan Stripling.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds.
p57
aVNow, this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds,
p58
aVand we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers,
p59
aVbecause we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs
p60
aVwhen we make sounds, and we all actually
p61
aVhave the genes for it. FoxP2, for example.
p62
aVAnd like ballet, it takes an extraordinary level of training.
p63
aVI mean, just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak.
p64
aVFrom the sound, we can actually track
p65
aVthe vocal fold position as it vibrates,
p66
aVand just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson's,
p67
aVso too are the vocal organs.
p68
aVSo on the bottom trace, you can see an example of
p69
aVirregular vocal fold tremor.
p70
aVWe see all the same symptoms.
p71
aVWe see vocal tremor, weakness and rigidity.
p72
aVThe speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy
p73
aVafter a while, and that's one of the example symptoms of it.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle,
p76
aVin some cases, but with any digital microphone,
p77
aVand using precision voice analysis software
p78
aVin combination with the latest in machine learning,
p79
aVwhich is very advanced by now,
p80
aVwe can now quantify exactly where somebody lies
p81
aVon a continuum between health and disease
p82
aVusing voice signals alone.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo these voice-based tests, how do they stack up against
p85
aVexpert clinical tests? We'll, they're both non-invasive.
p86
aVThe neurologist's test is non-invasive. They both use existing infrastructure.
p87
aVYou don't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it.
p88
aVAnd they're both accurate. Okay, but in addition,
p89
aVvoice-based tests are non-expert.
p90
aVThat means they can be self-administered.
p91
aVThey're high-speed, take about 30 seconds at most.
p92
aVThey're ultra-low cost, and we all know what happens.
p93
aVWhen something becomes ultra-low cost,
p94
aVit becomes massively scalable.
p95
aVSo here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now.
p96
aVWe can reduce logistical difficulties with patients.
p97
aVNo need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup.
p98
aVWe can do high-frequency monitoring to get objective data.
p99
aVWe can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials,
p100
aVand we can make population-scale screening
p101
aVfeasible for the first time.
p102
aVWe have the opportunity to start to search
p103
aVfor the early biomarkers of the disease before it's too late.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo, taking the first steps towards this today,
p106
aVwe're launching the Parkinson's Voice Initiative.
p107
aVWith Aculab and PatientsLikeMe, we're aiming
p108
aVto record a very large number of voices worldwide
p109
aVto collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals.
p110
aVWe have local numbers accessible to three quarters
p111
aVof a billion people on the planet.
p112
aVAnyone healthy or with Parkinson's can call in, cheaply,
p113
aVand leave recordings, a few cents each,
p114
aVand I'm really happy to announce that we've already hit
p115
aVsix percent of our target just in eight hours.
p116
aVThank you. (Applause)
p117
aV(Applause)
p118
aa(lp119
VTom Rielly: So Max, by taking all these samples of,
p120
aa(lp121
Vlet's say, 10,000 people,
p122
aVyou'll be able to tell who's healthy and who's not?
p123
aVWhat are you going to get out of those samples?
p124
aa(lp125
VMax Little: Yeah. Yeah. So what will happen is that,
p126
aVduring the call you have to indicate whether or not
p127
aVyou have the disease or not, you see. TR: Right.
p128
aVML: You see, some people may not do it. They may not get through it.
p129
aVBut we'll get a very large sample of data that is collected
p130
aVfrom all different circumstances, and it's getting it
p131
aVin different circumstances that matter because then
p132
aVwe are looking at ironing out the confounding factors,
p133
aVand looking for the actual markers of the disease.
p134
aa(lp135
VTR: So you're 86 percent accurate right now?
p136
aa(lp137
VML: It's much better than that.
p138
aVActually, my student Thanasis, I have to plug him,
p139
aVbecause he's done some fantastic work,
p140
aVand now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well,
p141
aVwhich enables this project, and we're getting 99 percent accuracy.
p142
aa(lp143
VTR: Ninety-nine. Well, that's an improvement.
p144
aVSo what that means is that people will be able to \u2014
p145
aVML: (Laughs)
p146
aVTR: People will be able to call in from their mobile phones
p147
aVand do this test, and people with Parkinson's could call in,
p148
aVrecord their voice, and then their doctor can check up
p149
aVon their progress, see where they're doing in this course of the disease.
p150
aa(lp151
VML: Absolutely.
p152
aa(lp153
VTR: Thanks so much. Max Little, everybody.
p154
aa(lp155
VML: Thanks, Tom. (Applause)

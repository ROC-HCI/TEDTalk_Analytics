VYou've all seen lots of articles on climate change,
p5
aVand here's yet another New York Times article,
p6
aVjust like every other darn one you've seen.
p7
aVIt says all the same stuff as all the other ones you've seen.
p8
aVIt even has the same amount of headline as all the other ones you've seen.
p9
aVWhat's unusual about this one, maybe, is that it's from 1953.
p10
aVAnd the reason I'm saying this
p11
aVis that you may have the idea this problem is relatively recent.
p12
aVThat people have just sort of figured out about it, and now
p13
aVwith Kyoto and the Governator and people beginning to actually do something,
p14
aVwe may be on the road to a solution.
p15
aVThe fact is \u2014 uh-uh.
p16
aVWe've known about this problem for 50 years, depending on how you count it.
p17
aVWe have talked about it endlessly over the last decade or so.
p18
aVAnd we've accomplished close to zip.
p19
aa(lp20
VThis is the growth rate of CO2 in the atmosphere.
p21
aVYou've seen this in various forms,
p22
aVbut maybe you haven't seen this one.
p23
aVWhat this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating.
p24
aVAnd that it's accelerating even faster
p25
aVthan what we thought was the worst case just a few years back.
p26
aVSo that red line there was something that a lot of skeptics said
p27
aVthe environmentalists only put in the projections
p28
aVto make the projections look as bad as possible,
p29
aVthat emissions would never grow as fast as that red line.
p30
aVBut in fact, they're growing faster.
p31
aa(lp32
VHere's some data from actually just 10 days ago,
p33
aVwhich shows this year's minimum of the Arctic Sea ice, and it's the lowest by far.
p34
aVAnd the rate at which the Arctic Sea ice is going away is a lot quicker than models.
p35
aVSo despite all sorts of experts like me flying around the planet and
p36
aVburning jet fuel, and politicians signing treaties \u2014
p37
aVin fact, you could argue the net effect of all this has been negative,
p38
aVbecause it's just consumed a lot of jet fuel. (Laughter)
p39
aVNo, no! In terms of what we really need to do to put the brakes on
p40
aVthis very high inertial thing \u2014 our big economy \u2014 we've really hardly started.
p41
aVReally, we're doing this, basically. Really, not very much.
p42
aa(lp43
VI don't want to depress you too much.
p44
aVThe problem is absolutely soluble, and even soluble in a way that's reasonably cheap.
p45
aVCheap meaning sort of the cost of the military, not the cost of medical care.
p46
aVCheap meaning a few percent of GDP.
p47
aVNo, this is really important to have this sense of scale.
p48
aVSo the problem is soluble, and the way we should go about solving it is, say,
p49
aVdealing with electricity production,
p50
aVwhich causes something like 43-or-so percent and rising of CO2 emissions.
p51
aVAnd we could do that by perfectly sensible things like conservation,
p52
aVand wind power, nuclear power and coal to CO2 capture,
p53
aVwhich are all things that are ready for giant scale deployment, and work.
p54
aVAll we lack is the action to actually spend the money to put those into place.
p55
aVInstead, we spend our time talking.
p56
aa(lp57
VBut nevertheless, that's not what I'm going to talk to you about tonight.
p58
aVWhat I'm going to talk to you about tonight is stuff we might do if we did nothing.
p59
aVAnd it's this stuff in the middle here, which is what you do
p60
aVif you don't stop the emissions quickly enough.
p61
aVAnd you need to deal \u2014 somehow break the link between human actions
p62
aVthat change climate, and the climate change itself. And that's particularly important
p63
aVbecause, of course, while we can adapt to climate change \u2014
p64
aVand it's important to be honest here, there will be some benefits to climate change.
p65
aVOh, yes, I think it's bad. I've spent my whole life working to stop it.
p66
aVBut one of the reasons it's politically hard is there are winners and losers \u2014 not all losers.
p67
aVBut, of course, the natural world, polar bears.
p68
aVI spent time skiing across the sea ice for weeks at a time in the high Arctic.
p69
aVThey will completely lose.
p70
aVAnd there's no adaption.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo this problem is absolutely soluble.
p73
aVThis geo-engineering idea, in it's simplest form, is basically the following.
p74
aVYou could put signed particles, say sulfuric acid particles \u2014 sulfates \u2014
p75
aVinto the upper atmosphere, the stratosphere,
p76
aVwhere they'd reflect away sunlight and cool the planet.
p77
aVAnd I know for certain that that will work.
p78
aVNot that there aren't side effects, but I know for certain it will work.
p79
aVAnd the reason is, it's been done.
p80
aVAnd it was done not by us, not by me, but by nature.
p81
aa(lp82
VHere's Mount Pinatubo in the early '90s. That put a whole bunch of sulfur
p83
aVin the stratosphere with a sort of atomic bomb-like cloud.
p84
aVThe result of that was pretty dramatic.
p85
aVAfter that, and some previous volcanoes we have, you see
p86
aVa quite dramatic cooling of the atmosphere.
p87
aVSo this lower bar is the upper atmosphere, the stratosphere,
p88
aVand it heats up after these volcanoes.
p89
aVBut you'll notice that in the upper bar, which is the lower atmosphere
p90
aVand the surface, it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit.
p91
aVThere's no big mystery about it.
p92
aVThere's lots of mystery in the details, and there's some bad side effects,
p93
aVlike it partially destroys the ozone layer \u2014 and I'll get to that in a minute.
p94
aVBut it clearly cools down.
p95
aVAnd one other thing: it's fast.
p96
aVIt's really important to say. So much of the other things that we ought to do,
p97
aVlike slowing emissions, are intrinsically slow, because it takes time
p98
aVto build all the hardware we need to reduce emissions.
p99
aVAnd not only that, when you cut emissions, you don't cut concentrations,
p100
aVbecause concentrations, the amount of CO2 in the air,
p101
aVis the sum of emissions over time.
p102
aVSo you can't step on the brakes very quickly.
p103
aVBut if you do this, it's quick.
p104
aVAnd there are times you might like to do something quick.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnother thing you might wonder about is, does it work?
p107
aVCan you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added CO2,
p108
aVand produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally?
p109
aVAnd the answer seems to be yes.
p110
aVSo here are the graphs you've seen lots of times before.
p111
aVThat's what the world looks like, under one particular climate model's view,
p112
aVwith twice the amount of CO2 in the air.
p113
aVThe lower graph is with twice the amount of CO2 and 1.8 percent less sunlight,
p114
aVand you're back to the original climate.
p115
aVAnd this graph from Ken Caldeira. It's important to say came, because
p116
aVKen \u2014 at a meeting that I believe Marty Hoffart was also at in the mid-'90s \u2014
p117
aVKen and I stood up at the back of the meeting and said,
p118
aV"Geo-engineering won't work."
p119
aVAnd to the person who was promoting it said,
p120
aV"The atmosphere's much more complicated."
p121
aVGave a bunch of physical reasons why it wouldn't do a very good compensation.
p122
aVKen went and ran his models, and found that it did.
p123
aa(lp124
VThis topic is also old.
p125
aVThat report that landed on President Johnson's desk when I was two years old \u2014
p126
aV1965.
p127
aVThat report, in fact, which had all the modern climate science \u2014
p128
aVthe only thing they talked about doing was geo-engineering.
p129
aVIt didn't even talk about cutting emissions,
p130
aVwhich is an incredible shift in our thinking about this problem.
p131
aVI'm not saying we shouldn't cut emissions.
p132
aVWe should, but it made exactly this point.
p133
aVSo, in a sense, there's not much new.
p134
aVThe one new thing is this essay.
p135
aVSo I should say, I guess, that since the time of that original President Johnson report,
p136
aVand the various reports of the U.S. National Academy \u2014
p137
aV1977, 1982, 1990 \u2014 people always talked about this idea.
p138
aVNot as something that was foolproof, but as an idea to think about.
p139
aa(lp140
VBut when climate became, politically, a hot topic \u2014 if I may make the pun \u2014
p141
aVin the last 15 years, this became so un-PC, we couldn't talk about it.
p142
aVIt just sunk below the surface. We weren't allowed to speak about it.
p143
aVBut in the last year, Paul Crutzen published this essay
p144
aVsaying roughly what's all been said before: that maybe, given our very slow rate
p145
aVof progress in solving this problem and the uncertain impacts,
p146
aVwe should think about things like this.
p147
aVHe said roughly what's been said before.
p148
aVThe big deal was he happened to have won the Nobel prize for ozone chemistry.
p149
aVAnd so people took him seriously when he said we should think about this,
p150
aVeven though there will be some ozone impacts.
p151
aVAnd in fact, he had some ideas to make them go away.
p152
aa(lp153
VThere was all sorts of press coverage, all over the world,
p154
aVgoing right down to "Dr. Strangelove Saves the Earth," from the Economist.
p155
aVAnd that got me thinking. I've worked on this topic on and off,
p156
aVbut not so much technically. And I was actually lying in bed thinking one night.
p157
aVAnd I thought about this child's toy \u2014 hence, the title of my talk \u2014
p158
aVand I wondered if you could use the same physics that makes that thing spin 'round
p159
aVin the child's radiometer, to levitate particles into the upper atmosphere
p160
aVand make them stay there.
p161
aVOne of the problems with sulfates is they fall out quickly.
p162
aVThe other problem is they're right in the ozone layer,
p163
aVand I'd prefer them above the ozone layer.
p164
aVAnd it turns out, I woke up the next morning, and I started to calculate this.
p165
aVIt was very hard to calculate from first principles. I was stumped.
p166
aVBut then I found out that there were all sorts of papers already published
p167
aVthat addressed this topic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere.
p168
aVSo it seems there are already fine particles
p169
aVthat are levitated up to what we call the mesosphere, about 100 kilometers up,
p170
aVthat already have this effect.
p171
aa(lp172
VI'll tell you very quickly how the effect works.
p173
aVThere are a lot of fun complexities
p174
aVthat I'd love to spend the whole evening on, but I won't.
p175
aVBut let's say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it's unevenly heated.
p176
aVSo the side facing the sun is warmer; the side away, cooler.
p177
aVGas molecules that bounce off the warm side
p178
aVbounce away with some extra velocity because it's warm.
p179
aVAnd so you see a net force away from the sun.
p180
aVThat's called the photophoretic force.
p181
aVThere are a bunch of other versions of it that I and some collaborators
p182
aVhave thought about how to exploit.
p183
aVAnd of course, we may be wrong \u2014
p184
aVthis hasn't all been peer reviewed, we're in the middle of thinking about it \u2014
p185
aVbut so far, it seems good.
p186
aVBut it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric lifetimes \u2014
p187
aVmuch longer than before \u2014 because they're levitated.
p188
aVWe can move things out of the stratosphere into the mesosphere,
p189
aVin principle solving the ozone problem.
p190
aVI'm sure there will be other problems that arise.
p191
aVFinally, we could make the particles migrate to over the poles,
p192
aVso we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles.
p193
aVWhich would have minimal bad impacts in the middle of the planet,
p194
aVwhere we live, and do the maximum job of what we might need to do,
p195
aVwhich is cooling the poles in case of planetary emergency, if you like.
p196
aa(lp197
VThis is a new idea that's crept up that may be, essentially,
p198
aVa cleverer idea than putting sulfates in.
p199
aVWhether this idea is right or some other idea is right,
p200
aVI think it's almost certain we will
p201
aVeventually think of cleverer things to do than just putting sulfur in.
p202
aVThat if engineers and scientists really turned their minds to this,
p203
aVit's amazing how we can affect the planet.
p204
aVThe one thing about this is it gives us extraordinary leverage.
p205
aVThis improved science and engineering will, whether we like it or not,
p206
aVgive us more and more leverage to affect the planet,
p207
aVto control the planet,
p208
aVto give us weather and climate control \u2014 not because we plan it,
p209
aVnot because we want it, just because science delivers it to us bit by bit,
p210
aVwith better knowledge of the way the system works
p211
aVand better engineering tools to effect it.
p212
aa(lp213
VNow, suppose that space aliens arrived.
p214
aVMaybe they're going to land at the U.N. headquarters down the road here,
p215
aVor maybe they'll pick a smarter spot \u2014
p216
aVbut suppose they arrive and they give you a box.
p217
aVAnd the box has two knobs.
p218
aVOne knob is the knob for controlling global temperature.
p219
aVMaybe another knob is a knob for controlling CO2 concentrations.
p220
aVYou might imagine that we would fight wars over that box.
p221
aVBecause we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs.
p222
aVWe have no global governance.
p223
aVAnd different people will have different places they want it set.
p224
aVNow, I don't think that's going to happen. It's not very likely.
p225
aa(lp226
VBut we're building that box.
p227
aVThe scientists and engineers of the world
p228
aVare building it piece by piece, in their labs.
p229
aVEven when they're doing it for other reasons.
p230
aVEven when they're thinking they're just working on protecting the environment.
p231
aVThey have no interest in crazy ideas like engineering the whole planet.
p232
aVThey develop science that makes it easier and easier to do.
p233
aVAnd so I guess my view on this is not that I want to do it \u2014 I do not \u2014
p234
aVbut that we should move this out of the shadows and talk about it seriously.
p235
aVBecause sooner or later, we'll be confronted with decisions about this,
p236
aVand it's better if we think hard about it,
p237
aVeven if we want to think hard about reasons why we should never do it.
p238
aa(lp239
VI'll give you two different ways to think about this problem that are the beginning
p240
aVof my thinking about how to think about it.
p241
aVBut what we need is not just a few oddballs like me thinking about this.
p242
aVWe need a broader debate.
p243
aVA debate that involves musicians, scientists, philosophers, writers,
p244
aVwho get engaged with this question about climate engineering
p245
aVand think seriously about what its implications are.
p246
aVSo here's one way to think about it,
p247
aVwhich is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it's cheaper.
p248
aVI guess the thing I haven't said about this is, it is absurdly cheap.
p249
aVIt's conceivable that, say, using the sulfates method or this method I've come up with,
p250
aVyou could create an ice age at a cost of .001 percent of GDP.
p251
aVIt's very cheap. We have a lot of leverage.
p252
aVIt's not a good idea, but it's just important. (Laughter)
p253
aVI'll tell you how big the lever is: the lever is that big.
p254
aVAnd that calculation isn't much in dispute.
p255
aVYou might argue about the sanity of it, but the leverage is real. (Laughter)
p256
aa(lp257
VSo because of this, we could deal with the problem
p258
aVsimply by stopping reducing emissions,
p259
aVand just as the concentrations go up, we can increase
p260
aVthe amount of geo-engineering.
p261
aVI don't think anybody takes that seriously.
p262
aVBecause under this scenario, we walk further and further away
p263
aVfrom the current climate.
p264
aVWe have all sorts of other problems, like ocean acidification
p265
aVthat come from CO2 in the atmosphere, anyway.
p266
aVNobody but maybe one or two very odd folks really suggest this.
p267
aa(lp268
VBut here's a case which is harder to reject.
p269
aVLet's say that we don't do geo-engineering, we do what we ought to do,
p270
aVwhich is get serious about cutting emissions.
p271
aVBut we don't really know how quickly we have to cut them.
p272
aVThere's a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much.
p273
aVSo let's say that we work hard, and we actually don't just tap the brakes,
p274
aVbut we step hard on the brakes and really reduce emissions
p275
aVand eventually reduce concentrations.
p276
aVAnd maybe someday \u2014 like 2075, October 23 \u2014
p277
aVwe finally reach that glorious day where concentrations have peaked
p278
aVand are rolling down the other side.
p279
aVAnd we have global celebrations, and we've actually started to \u2014 you know,
p280
aVwe've seen the worst of it.
p281
aVBut maybe on that day we also find that the Greenland ice sheet
p282
aVis really melting unacceptably fast, fast enough to put meters of sea level on
p283
aVthe oceans in the next 100 years,
p284
aVand remove some of the biggest cities from the map.
p285
aVThat's an absolutely possible scenario.
p286
aVWe might decide at that point that even though geo-engineering was uncertain
p287
aVand morally unhappy, that it's a lot better than not geo-engineering.
p288
aVAnd that's a very different way to look at the problem.
p289
aVIt's using this as risk control, not instead of action.
p290
aVIt's saying that you do some geo-engineering for a little while
p291
aVto take the worst of the heat off, not that you'd use it as a substitute for action.
p292
aa(lp293
VBut there is a problem with that view.
p294
aVAnd the problem is the following:
p295
aVknowledge that geo-engineering is possible makes
p296
aVthe climate impacts look less fearsome,
p297
aVand that makes a weaker commitment to cutting emissions today.
p298
aVThis is what economists call a moral hazard.
p299
aVAnd that's one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about,
p300
aVand, in general, I think it's the underlying reason
p301
aVthat it's been politically unacceptable to talk about this.
p302
aVBut you don't make good policy by hiding things in a drawer.
p303
aa(lp304
VI'll leave you with three questions, and then one final quote.
p305
aVShould we do serious research on this topic?
p306
aVShould we have a national research program that looks at this?
p307
aVNot just at how you would do it better,
p308
aVbut also what all the risks and downsides of it are.
p309
aVRight now, you have a few enthusiasts talking about it, some in a positive side,
p310
aVsome in a negative side \u2014 but that's a dangerous state to be in
p311
aVbecause there's very little depth of knowledge on this topic.
p312
aVA very small amount of money would get us some.
p313
aVMany of us \u2014 maybe now me \u2014 think we should do that.
p314
aVBut I have a lot of reservations.
p315
aVMy reservations are principally about the moral hazard problem,
p316
aVand I don't really know how we can best avoid the moral hazard.
p317
aVI think there is a serious problem: as you talk about this,
p318
aVpeople begin to think they don't need to work so hard to cut emissions.
p319
aa(lp320
VAnother thing is, maybe we need a treaty.
p321
aVA treaty that decides who gets to do this.
p322
aVRight now we may think of a big, rich country like the U.S. doing this.
p323
aVBut it might well be that, in fact, if China wakes up in 2030 and realizes
p324
aVthat the climate impacts are just unacceptable,
p325
aVthey may not be very interested in our moral conversations about how to do this,
p326
aVand they may just decide they'd really rather have a geo-engineered world
p327
aVthan a non-geo-engineered world.
p328
aVAnd we'll have no international mechanism to figure out who makes the decision.
p329
aa(lp330
VSo here's one last thought, which was said much, much better
p331
aV25 years ago in the U.S. National Academy report than I can say today.
p332
aVAnd I think it really summarizes where we are here.
p333
aVThat the CO2 problem, the climate problem that we've heard about,
p334
aVis driving lots of things \u2014 innovations in the energy technologies
p335
aVthat will reduce emissions \u2014
p336
aVbut also, I think, inevitably, it will drive us towards thinking about climate
p337
aVand weather control, whether we like it or not.
p338
aVAnd it's time to begin thinking about it,
p339
aVeven if the reason we're thinking about it is to construct arguments
p340
aVfor why we shouldn't do it.
p341
aVThank you very much.

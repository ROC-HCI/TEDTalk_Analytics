VThere's this fact that I love that I read somewhere once,
p5
aVthat one of the things that's contributed to homo sapiens' success
p6
aVas a species
p7
aVis our lack of body hair \u2014
p8
aVthat our hairlessness, our nakedness
p9
aVcombined with our invention of clothing,
p10
aVgives us the ability to modulate our body temperature
p11
aVand thus be able to survive in any climate we choose.
p12
aVAnd now we've evolved to the point where we can't survive without clothing.
p13
aVAnd it's more than just utility,
p14
aVnow it's a communication.
p15
aVEverything that we choose to put on is a narrative,
p16
aVa story about where we've been,
p17
aVwhat we're doing,
p18
aVwho we want to be.
p19
aa(lp20
VI was a lonely kid.
p21
aVI didn't have an easy time finding friends to play with,
p22
aVand I ended up making a lot of my own play.
p23
aVI made a lot of my own toys.
p24
aVIt began with ice cream.
p25
aVThere was a Baskin-Robbins in my hometown,
p26
aVand they served ice cream from behind the counter
p27
aVin these giant, five-gallon, cardboard tubs.
p28
aVAnd someone told me \u2014 I was eight years old \u2014
p29
aVsomeone told me that when they were done with those tubs,
p30
aVthey washed them out and kept them in the back,
p31
aVand if you asked they would give you one.
p32
aVIt took me a couple of weeks to work up the courage,
p33
aVbut I did, and they did.
p34
aVThey gave me one \u2014 I went home with this beautiful cardboard tub.
p35
aVI was trying to figure out what I could do with this exotic material \u2014
p36
aVmetal ring, top and bottom.
p37
aVI started turning it over in my head, and I realized, "Wait a minute \u2014
p38
aVmy head actually fits inside this thing."
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VYeah, I cut a hole out,
p43
aVI put some acetate in there
p44
aVand I made myself a space helmet.
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VI needed a place to wear the space helmet,
p49
aVso I found a refrigerator box a couple blocks from home.
p50
aVI pushed it home,
p51
aVand in my parents' guest room closet,
p52
aVI turned it into a spaceship.
p53
aVI started with a control panel out of cardboard.
p54
aVI cut a hole for a radar screen
p55
aVand put a flashlight underneath it to light it.
p56
aVI put a view screen up, which I offset off the back wall \u2014
p57
aVand this is where I thought I was being really clever \u2014
p58
aVwithout permission, I painted the back wall of the closet black
p59
aVand put a star field,
p60
aVwhich I lit up with some Christmas lights I found in the attic,
p61
aVand I went on some space missions.
p62
aa(lp63
VA couple years later,
p64
aVthe movie "Jaws" came out.
p65
aVI was way too young to see it, but I was caught up in "Jaws" fever,
p66
aVlike everyone else in America at the time.
p67
aVThere was a store in my town that had a "Jaws" costume in their window,
p68
aVand my mom must have overheard me talking to someone
p69
aVabout how awesome I thought this costume was,
p70
aVbecause a couple days before Halloween,
p71
aVshe blew my freaking mind by giving me this "Jaws" costume.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow, I recognize it's a bit of a trope
p74
aVfor people of a certain age to complain
p75
aVthat kids these days have no idea how good they have it,
p76
aVbut let me just show you a random sampling
p77
aVof entry-level kids' costumes you can buy online right now ...
p78
aV... and this is the "Jaws" costume my mom bought for me.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VThis is a paper-thin shark face
p83
aVand a vinyl bib with the poster of "Jaws" on it.
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd I loved it.
p88
aa(lp89
VA couple years later,
p90
aVmy dad took me to a film called "Excalibur."
p91
aVI actually got him to take me to it twice,
p92
aVwhich is no small thing, because it is a hard, R-rated film.
p93
aVBut it wasn't the blood and guts or the boobs
p94
aVthat made me want to go see it again.
p95
aVThey helped \u2014
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VIt was the armor.
p100
aVThe armor in "Excalibur" was intoxicatingly beautiful to me.
p101
aVThese were literally knights in shining, mirror-polished armor.
p102
aVAnd moreover, the knights in "Excalibur" wear their armor everywhere.
p103
aVAll the time \u2014 they wear it at dinner, they wear it to bed.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VI was like, "Are they reading my mind?
p108
aVI want to wear armor all the time!"
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VSo I went back to my favorite material,
p113
aVthe gateway drug for making,
p114
aVcorrugated cardboard,
p115
aVand I made myself a suit of armor,
p116
aVreplete with the neck shields and a white horse.
p117
aVNow that I've oversold it,
p118
aVhere's a picture of the armor that I made.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
V(Applause)
p123
aa(lp124
VNow, this is only the first suit of armor I made
p125
aVinspired by "Excalibur."
p126
aVA couple of years later,
p127
aVI convinced my dad to embark on making me a proper suit of armor.
p128
aVOver about a month,
p129
aVhe graduated me from cardboard to roofing aluminum called flashing
p130
aVand still, one of my all-time favorite attachment materials,
p131
aVPOP rivets.
p132
aVWe carefully, over that month,
p133
aVconstructed an articulated suit of aluminum armor
p134
aVwith compound curves.
p135
aVWe drilled holes in the helmet so that I could breathe,
p136
aVand I finished just in time for Halloween and wore it to school.
p137
aVNow, this is the one thing in this talk
p138
aVthat I don't have a slide to show you,
p139
aVbecause no photo exists of this armor.
p140
aVI did wear it to school,
p141
aVthere was a yearbook photographer patrolling the halls,
p142
aVbut he never found me, for reasons that are about to become clear.
p143
aa(lp144
VThere were things I didn't anticipate
p145
aVabout wearing a complete suit of aluminum armor to school.
p146
aVIn third period math, I was standing in the back of class,
p147
aVand I'm standing in the back of class
p148
aVbecause the armor did not allow me to sit down.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VThis is the first thing I didn't anticipate.
p153
aVAnd then my teacher looks at me sort of concerned
p154
aVabout halfway through the class and says, "Are you feeling OK?"
p155
aVI'm thinking, "Are you kidding? Am I feeling OK?
p156
aVI'm wearing a suit of armor! I am having the time of my \u2014"
p157
aVAnd I'm just about to tell her how great I feel,
p158
aVwhen the classroom starts to list to the left
p159
aVand disappear down this long tunnel,
p160
aVand then I woke up in the nurse's office.
p161
aVI had passed out from heat exhaustion,
p162
aVwearing the armor.
p163
aVAnd when I woke up,
p164
aVI wasn't embarrassed about having passed out in front of my class,
p165
aVI was wondering, "Who took my armor? Where's my armor?"
p166
aa(lp167
VOK, fast-forward a whole bunch of years,
p168
aVsome colleagues and I get hired to make a show for Discovery Channel,
p169
aVcalled "MythBusters."
p170
aVAnd over 14 years,
p171
aVI learn on the job how to build experimental methodologies
p172
aVand how to tell stories about them for television.
p173
aVI also learn early on
p174
aVthat costuming can play a key role in this storytelling.
p175
aa(lp176
VI use costumes to add humor, comedy, color
p177
aVand narrative clarity to the stories we're telling.
p178
aVAnd then we do an episode called "Dumpster Diving,"
p179
aVand I learn a little bit more
p180
aVabout the deeper implications of what costuming means to me.
p181
aVIn the episode "Dumpster Diving,"
p182
aVthe question we were trying to answer is:
p183
aVIs jumping into a dumpster as safe
p184
aVas the movies would lead you to believe?
p185
aa(lp186
V(Laughter)
p187
aa(lp188
VThe episode was going to have two distinct parts to it.
p189
aVOne was where we get trained to jump off buildings by a stuntman
p190
aVinto an air bag.
p191
aVAnd the second was the graduation to the experiment:
p192
aVwe'd fill a dumpster full of material and we'd jump into it.
p193
aVI wanted to visually separate these two elements,
p194
aVand I thought,
p195
aV"Well, for the first part we're training, so we should wear sweatsuits \u2014
p196
aVOh! Let's put 'Stunt Trainee' on the back of the sweatsuits.
p197
aVThat's for the training."
p198
aVBut for the second part, I wanted something really visually striking \u2014
p199
aV"I know! I'll dress as Neo from 'The Matrix.'"
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VSo I went to Haight Street.
p204
aVI bought some beautiful knee-high, buckle boots.
p205
aVI found a long, flowing coat on eBay.
p206
aVI got sunglasses, which I had to wear contact lenses in order to wear.
p207
aVThe day of the experiment shoot comes up,
p208
aVand I step out of my car in this costume,
p209
aVand my crew takes a look at me ...
p210
aVand start suppressing their church giggles.
p211
aVThey're like, "(Laugh sound)."
p212
aVAnd I feel two distinct things at this moment.
p213
aVI feel total embarrassment
p214
aVover the fact that it's so nakedly clear to my crew
p215
aVthat I'm completely into wearing this costume.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VBut the producer in my mind reminds myself
p220
aVthat in the high-speed shot in slow-mo,
p221
aVthat flowing coat is going to look beautiful behind me.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VFive years into the "MythBusters" run,
p226
aVwe got invited to appear at San Diego Comic-Con.
p227
aVI'd known about Comic-Con for years and never had time to go.
p228
aVThis was the big leagues \u2014 this was costuming mecca.
p229
aVPeople fly in from all over the world
p230
aVto show their amazing creations on the floor in San Diego.
p231
aVAnd I wanted to participate.
p232
aVI decided that I would put together an elaborate costume
p233
aVthat covered me completely,
p234
aVand I would walk the floor of San Diego Comic-Con anonymously.
p235
aVThe costume I chose?
p236
aVHellboy.
p237
aVThat's not my costume,
p238
aVthat's actually Hellboy.
p239
aa(lp240
V(Laughter)
p241
aa(lp242
VBut I spent months
p243
aVassembling the most screen-accurate Hellboy costume I could,
p244
aVfrom the boots to the belt to the pants
p245
aVto the right hand of doom.
p246
aVI found a guy who made a prosthetic Hellboy head and chest
p247
aVand I put them on.
p248
aVI even had contact lenses made in my prescription.
p249
aVI wore it onto the floor at Comic-Con
p250
aVand I can't even tell you how balls hot it was in that costume.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
VSweating! I should've remembered this.
p255
aVI'm sweating buckets and the contact lenses hurt my eyes,
p256
aVand none of it matters because I'm totally in love.
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
VNot just with the process of putting on this costume and walking the floor,
p261
aVbut also with the community of other costumers.
p262
aVIt's not called costuming at Cons,
p263
aVit's called "cosplay."
p264
aVNow ostensibly, cosplay means people who dress up
p265
aVas their favorite characters from film and television
p266
aVand especially anime,
p267
aVbut it is so much more than that.
p268
aVThese aren't just people who find a costume and put it on \u2014
p269
aVthey mash them up.
p270
aVThey bend them to their will.
p271
aVThey change them to be the characters they want to be in those productions.
p272
aVThey're super clever and genius.
p273
aVThey let their freak flag fly and it's beautiful.
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
VBut more than that,
p278
aVthey rehearse their costumes.
p279
aVAt Comic-Con or any other Con,
p280
aVyou don't just take pictures of people walking around.
p281
aVYou go up and say,
p282
aV"Hey, I like your costume, can I take your picture?"
p283
aVAnd then you give them time to get into their pose.
p284
aVThey've worked hard on their pose
p285
aVto make their costume look great for your camera.
p286
aVAnd it's so beautiful to watch.
p287
aVAnd I take this to heart.
p288
aVAt subsequent Cons,
p289
aVI learn Heath Ledger's shambling walk as the Joker from "The Dark Knight."
p290
aVI learn how to be a scary Ringwraith from "Lord of the Rings,"
p291
aVand I actually frighten some children.
p292
aVI learned that "hrr hrr hrr" \u2014
p293
aVthat head laugh that Chewbacca does.
p294
aa(lp295
VAnd then I dressed up as No-Face from "Spirited Away."
p296
aVIf you don't know about "Spirited Away" and its director, Hayao Miyazaki,
p297
aVfirst of all, you're welcome.
p298
aa(lp299
V(Laughter)
p300
aa(lp301
VThis is a masterpiece, and one of my all-time favorite films.
p302
aVIt's about a young girl named Chihiro who gets lost in the spirit world
p303
aVin an abandoned Japanese theme park.
p304
aVAnd she finds her way back out again
p305
aVwith the help of a couple of friends she makes \u2014
p306
aVa captured dragon named Haku
p307
aVand a lonely demon named No-Face.
p308
aVNo-Face is lonely and he wants to make friends,
p309
aVand he thinks the way to do it is by luring them to him
p310
aVand producing gold in his hand.
p311
aVBut this doesn't go very well,
p312
aVand so he ends up going on kind of a rampage
p313
aVuntil Chihiro saves him,
p314
aVrescues him.
p315
aa(lp316
VSo I put together a No-Face costume,
p317
aVand I wore it on the floor at Comic-Con.
p318
aVAnd I very carefully practiced No-Face's gestures.
p319
aVI resolved I would not speak in this costume at all.
p320
aVWhen people asked to take my picture,
p321
aVI would nod
p322
aVand I would shyly stand next to them.
p323
aVThey would take the picture
p324
aVand then I would secret out from behind my robe
p325
aVa chocolate gold coin.
p326
aVAnd at the end of the photo process, I'd make it appear for them.
p327
aVAh, ah ah! \u2014 like that.
p328
aa(lp329
VAnd people were freaking out.
p330
aV"Holy crap! Gold from No-Face! Oh my god, this is so cool!"
p331
aVAnd I'm feeling and I'm walking the floor and it's fantastic.
p332
aVAnd about 15 minutes in something happens.
p333
aVSomebody grabs my hand,
p334
aVand they put a coin back into it.
p335
aVAnd I think maybe they're giving me a coin as a return gift,
p336
aVbut no, this is one of the coins that I'd given away.
p337
aVI don't know why.
p338
aVAnd I keep on going, I take some more pictures.
p339
aVAnd then it happens again.
p340
aVUnderstand, I can't see anything inside this costume.
p341
aVI can see through the mouth \u2014
p342
aVI can see people's shoes.
p343
aVI can hear what they're saying and I can see their feet.
p344
aVBut the third time someone gives me back a coin,
p345
aVI want to know what's going on.
p346
aVSo I sort of tilt my head back to get a better view,
p347
aVand what I see is someone walking away from me going like this.
p348
aVAnd then it hits me:
p349
aVit's bad luck to take gold from No-Face.
p350
aVIn the film "Spirited Away,"
p351
aVbad luck befalls those who take gold from No-Face.
p352
aa(lp353
VThis isn't a performer-audience relationship; this is cosplay.
p354
aVWe are, all of us on that floor,
p355
aVinjecting ourselves into a narrative that meant something to us.
p356
aVAnd we're making it our own.
p357
aVWe're connecting with something important inside of us.
p358
aVAnd the costumes are how we reveal ourselves
p359
aVto each other.
p360
aa(lp361
VThank you.
p362
aa(lp363
V(Applause)

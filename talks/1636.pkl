VOn March 14, this year,
p5
aVI posted this poster on Facebook.
p6
aVThis is an image of me and my daughter
p7
aVholding the Israeli flag.
p8
aVI will try to explain to you about the context of why
p9
aVand when I posted.
p10
aa(lp11
VA few days ago, I was sitting waiting
p12
aVon the line at the grocery store,
p13
aVand the owner and one of the clients
p14
aVwere talking to each other,
p15
aVand the owner was explaining to the client
p16
aVthat we're going to get 10,000 missiles on Israel.
p17
aVAnd the client was saying, no, it's 10,000 a day.
p18
aV(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
V("10,000 missiles") This is the context. This is where we are now in Israel.
p21
aVWe have this war with Iran coming for 10 years now,
p22
aVand we have people, you know, afraid.
p23
aVIt's like every year it's the last minute
p24
aVthat we can do something about the war with Iran.
p25
aVIt's like, if we don't act now, it's too late forever,
p26
aVfor 10 years now.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo at some point it became, you know, to me,
p29
aVI'm a graphic designer, so I made posters about it
p30
aVand I posted the one I just showed you before.
p31
aVMost of the time, I make posters, I post them on Facebook,
p32
aVmy friends like it, don't like it,
p33
aVmost of the time don't like it, don't share it,
p34
aVdon't nothing,
p35
aVand it's another day.
p36
aVSo I went to sleep, and that was it for me.
p37
aVAnd later on in the night, I woke up
p38
aVbecause I'm always waking up in the night,
p39
aVand I went by the computer and I see all these red dots,
p40
aVyou know, on Facebook, which I've never seen before.
p41
aV(Laughter)
p42
aVAnd I was like, "What's going on?"
p43
aVSo I come to the computer and I start looking on,
p44
aVand suddenly I see many people talking to me,
p45
aVmost of them I don't know,
p46
aVand a few of them from Iran,
p47
aVwhich is \u2014 What?
p48
aVBecause you have to understand,
p49
aVin Israel we don't talk with people from Iran.
p50
aVWe don't know people from Iran.
p51
aVIt's like, on Facebook, you have friends only from \u2014
p52
aVit's like your neighbors are your friends on Facebook.
p53
aVAnd now people from Iran are talking to me.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo I start answering this girl, and she's telling me
p56
aVshe saw the poster and she asked her family to come,
p57
aVbecause they don't have a computer, she asked her family
p58
aVto come to see the poster, and they're all sitting in the living room crying.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo I'm like, whoa.
p61
aVI ask my wife to come, and I tell her, you have to see that.
p62
aVPeople are crying, and she came, she read the text,
p63
aVand she started to cry.
p64
aVAnd everybody's crying now. (Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VSo I don't know what to do, so my first reflex,
p67
aVas a graphic designer, is, you know, to show everybody
p68
aVwhat I'd just seen, and people started to see them
p69
aVand to share them, and that's how it started.
p70
aVThe day after, when really it became a lot of talking,
p71
aVI said to myself, and my wife said to me,
p72
aVI also want a poster,
p73
aVso this is her. (Laughter)
p74
aVBecause it's working, put me in a poster now.
p75
aa(lp76
VBut more seriously, I was like, okay, these ones work,
p77
aVbut it's not just about me, it's about people from Israel
p78
aVwho want to say something.
p79
aVSo I'm going to shoot all the people I know, if they want,
p80
aVand I'm going to put them in a poster and I'm going to share them.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo I went to my neighbors and friends and students
p83
aVand I just asked them, give me a picture, I will make you a poster.
p84
aVAnd that's how it started. And that's how, really,
p85
aVit's unleashed, because suddenly people
p86
aVfrom Facebook, friends and others,
p87
aVjust understand that they can be part of it.
p88
aVIt's not just one dude making one poster,
p89
aVit's \u2014 we can be part of it, so they start sending me pictures
p90
aVand ask me, "Make me a poster. Post it.
p91
aVTell the Iranians we from Israel love you too."
p92
aVIt became, you know, at some point it was really, really intense.
p93
aVI mean, so many pictures, so I asked friends
p94
aVto come, graphic designers most of them,
p95
aVto make posters with me, because I didn't have the time.
p96
aVIt was a huge amount of pictures.
p97
aVSo for a few days, that's how my living room was.
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd we received Israeli posters, Israeli images,
p100
aVbut also lots of comments, lots of messages from Iran.
p101
aVAnd we took these messages and we made posters out of it,
p102
aVbecause I know people: They don't read, they see images.
p103
aVIf it's an image, they may read it.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo here are a few of them.
p106
aa(lp107
V("You are my first Israelian friend. I wish we both get rid of our idiot politicians, anyway nice to see you!")
p108
aa(lp109
V("I love that blue. I love that star. I love that flag.") This one is really moving for me because it's the story
p110
aVof a girl who has been raised in Iran
p111
aVto walk on an Israeli flag to enter her school every morning,
p112
aVand now that she sees the posters that we're sending,
p113
aVshe starts \u2014 she said that she changed her mind,
p114
aVand now she loves that blue, she loves that star,
p115
aVand she loves that flag, talking about the Israeli flag,
p116
aVand she wished that we'd meet and come to visit one another,
p117
aVand just a few days after I posted the first poster.
p118
aa(lp119
VThe day after,
p120
aVIranians started to respond with their own posters.
p121
aVThey have graphic designers. What? (Laughter)
p122
aVCrazy, crazy.
p123
aVSo you can see they are still shy, they don't want to show their faces,
p124
aVbut they want to spread the message.
p125
aVThey want to respond. They want to say the same thing.
p126
aVSo. And now it's communication.
p127
aVIt's a two-way story. It's Israelis and Iranians
p128
aVsending the same message, one to each other.
p129
aa(lp130
V("My Israeli Friends. I don't hate you. I don't want War.")
p131
aa(lp132
VThis never happened before, and this is two people
p133
aVsupposed to be enemies, we're on the verge of a war,
p134
aVand suddenly people on Facebook are starting to say,
p135
aV"I like this guy. I love those guys."
p136
aVAnd it became really big at some point.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd then it became news.
p139
aVBecause when you're seeing the Middle East, you see only the bad news.
p140
aVAnd suddenly, there is something that was happening
p141
aVthat was good news. So the guys on the news,
p142
aVthey say, "Okay, let's talk about this."
p143
aVAnd they just came, and it was so much,
p144
aa(lp145
VI remember one day, Michal,
p146
aVshe was talking with the journalist, and she was asking him,
p147
aV"Who's gonna see the show?"And he said, "Everybody."
p148
aa(lp149
VSo she said, "Everybody in Palestine, in where? Israel?
p150
aVWho is everybody?""Everybody."
p151
aa(lp152
VThey said, "Syria?" "Syria."
p153
aa(lp154
V"Lebanon?""Lebanon."
p155
aVAt some point, he just said, "40 million people are going to see you today.
p156
aVIt's everybody." The Chinese.
p157
aVAnd we were just at the beginning of the story.
p158
aa(lp159
VSomething crazy also happened.
p160
aVEvery time a country started talking about it,
p161
aVlike Germany, America, wherever,
p162
aVa page on Facebook popped up with the same logo
p163
aVwith the same stories, so at the beginning
p164
aVwe had "Iran-Loves-Israel," which is an Iranian
p165
aVsitting in Tehran, saying, "Okay, Israel loves Iran?
p166
aVI give you Iran-Loves-Israel."
p167
aVYou have Palestine-Loves-Israel.
p168
aVYou have Lebanon that just \u2014 a few days ago.
p169
aVAnd this whole list of pages on Facebook
p170
aVdedicated to the same message,
p171
aVto people sending their love, one to each other.
p172
aa(lp173
VThe moment I really understood that something was happening,
p174
aVa friend of mine told me,
p175
aV"Google the word 'Israel.'"
p176
aVAnd those were the first images on those days
p177
aVthat popped up from Google
p178
aVwhen you were typing, "Israel" or "Iran."
p179
aVWe really changed how people see the Middle East.
p180
aVBecause you're not in the Middle East.
p181
aVYou're somewhere over there, and then you want to see the Middle East,
p182
aVso you go on Google and you say, "Israel,"
p183
aVand they give you the bad stuff.
p184
aVAnd for a few days you got those images.
p185
aVToday the Israel-Loves-Iran page
p186
aVis this number, 80,831, and two million people last week
p187
aVwent on the page and shared, liked, I don't know,
p188
aVcommented on one of the photos.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo for five months now, that's what we are doing,
p191
aVme, Michal, a few of my friends, are just making images.
p192
aVWe're showing a new reality
p193
aVby just making images
p194
aVbecause that's how the world perceives us.
p195
aVThey see images of us, and they see bad images.
p196
aVSo we're working on making good images. End of story.
p197
aa(lp198
VLook at this one. This is the Iran-Loves-Israel page.
p199
aVThis is not the Israel-Loves-Iran. This is not my page.
p200
aVThis is a guy in Tehran on the day of remembrance
p201
aVof the Israeli fallen soldier
p202
aVputting an image of an Israeli soldier on his page.
p203
aVThis is the enemy.
p204
aVWhat?
p205
aa(lp206
V("Our heartfelt condolences to the families who lost their dearests in terror attack in Bulgaria")
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd it's going both ways.
p209
aVIt's like, we are showing respect, one to each other.
p210
aVAnd we're understanding. And you show compassion.
p211
aVAnd you become friends.
p212
aVAnd at some point, you become friends on Facebook,
p213
aVand you become friends in life.
p214
aVYou can go and travel and meet people.
p215
aVAnd I was in Munich a few weeks ago.
p216
aVI went there to open an exposition about Iran
p217
aVand I met there with people from the page
p218
aVthat told me, "Okay, you're going to be in Europe,
p219
aVI'm coming. I'm coming from France, from Holland,
p220
aVfrom Germany," of course, and from Israel people came,
p221
aVand we just met there for the first time in real life.
p222
aVI met with people that are supposed to be my enemies
p223
aVfor the first time. And we just shake hands,
p224
aVand have a coffee and a nice discussion,
p225
aVand we talk about food and basketball.
p226
aVAnd that was the end of it.
p227
aVRemember that image from the beginning?
p228
aVAt some point we met in real life, and we became friends.
p229
aa(lp230
VAnd it goes the other way around.
p231
aVSome girl that we met on Facebook
p232
aVnever been in Israel, born and raised in Iran,
p233
aVlives in Germany, afraid of Israelis
p234
aVbecause of what she knows about us,
p235
aVdecides after a few months of talking on the Internet
p236
aVwith some Israelis to come to Israel,
p237
aVand she gets on the plane and arrives at Ben Gurion
p238
aVand says, "Okay, not that big a deal."
p239
aa(lp240
VSo a few weeks ago, the stress is getting higher,
p241
aVso we start this new campaign
p242
aVcalled "Not ready to die in your war."
p243
aVI mean, it's plus/minus the same message,
p244
aVbut we wanted really to add some aggressivity to it.
p245
aVAnd again, something amazing happened,
p246
aVsomething that we didn't have on the first wave of the campaign.
p247
aVNow people from Iran, the same ones who were shy
p248
aVat the first campaign and just sent, you know,
p249
aVtheir foot and half their faces,
p250
aVnow they're sending their faces, and they're saying,
p251
aV"Okay, no problem, we're into it. We are with you."
p252
aVJust read where those guys are from.
p253
aVAnd for every guy from Israel,
p254
aVyou've got someone from Iran.
p255
aVJust people sending their pictures.
p256
aVCrazy, yes?
p257
aa(lp258
VSo \u2014
p259
aV(Applause)
p260
aa(lp261
VSo you may ask yourself, who is this dude?
p262
aa(lp263
VMy name is Ronny Edry, and I'm 41, I'm an Israeli,
p264
aVI'm a father of two, I'm a husband,
p265
aVand I'm a graphic designer. I'm teaching graphic design.
p266
aVAnd I'm not that naive, because a lot of the time
p267
aVI've been asked, many times I've been asked, "Yeah, but,
p268
aVthis is really naive, sending flowers over, I mean \u2014 "
p269
aa(lp270
VI was in the army. I was in the paratroopers for three years,
p271
aVand I know how it looks from the ground.
p272
aVI know how it can look really bad.
p273
aVSo to me, this is the courageous thing to do,
p274
aVto try to reach the other side before it's too late,
p275
aVbecause when it's going to be too late, it's going to be too late.
p276
aVAnd sometimes war is inevitable, sometimes,
p277
aVbut maybe [with] effort, we can avoid it.
p278
aVMaybe as people, because especially in Israel,
p279
aVwe're in a democracy. We have the freedom of speech,
p280
aVand maybe that little thing can change something.
p281
aVAnd really, we can be our own ambassadors.
p282
aVWe can just send a message and hope for the best.
p283
aa(lp284
VSo I want to ask Michal, my wife, to come with me
p285
aVon the stage just to make with you one image,
p286
aVbecause it's all about images.
p287
aVAnd maybe that image will help us change something.
p288
aVJust raise that. Exactly.
p289
aVAnd I'm just going to take a picture of it,
p290
aVand I'm just going to post it on Facebook
p291
aVwith kind of "Israelis for peace" or something.
p292
aa(lp293
VOh my God.
p294
aVDon't cry.
p295
aa(lp296
VThank you guys.
p297
aV(Applause)

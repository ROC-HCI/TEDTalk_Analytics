VSo I have bad news, I have good news,
p5
aVand I have a task.
p6
aVSo the bad news is that we all get sick.
p7
aVI get sick. You get sick.
p8
aVAnd every one of us gets sick, and the question really is,
p9
aVhow sick do we get? Is it something that kills us?
p10
aVIs it something that we survive?
p11
aVIs it something that we can treat?
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd we've gotten sick as long as we've been people.
p14
aVAnd so we've always looked for reasons to explain why we get sick.
p15
aVAnd for a long time, it was the gods, right?
p16
aVThe gods are angry with me, or the gods are testing me,
p17
aVright? Or God, singular, more recently,
p18
aVis punishing me or judging me.
p19
aVAnd as long as we've looked for explanations,
p20
aVwe've wound up with something that gets closer and closer to science,
p21
aVwhich is hypotheses as to why we get sick,
p22
aVand as long as we've had hypotheses about why we get sick, we've tried to treat it as well.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo this is Avicenna. He wrote a book over a thousand years ago called "The Canon of Medicine,"
p25
aVand the rules he laid out for testing medicines
p26
aVare actually really similar to the rules we have today,
p27
aVthat the disease and the medicine must be the same strength,
p28
aVthe medicine needs to be pure, and in the end we need
p29
aVto test it in people. And so if you put together these themes
p30
aVof a narrative or a hypothesis in human testing,
p31
aVright, you get some beautiful results,
p32
aVeven when we didn't have very good technologies.
p33
aa(lp34
VThis is a guy named Carlos Finlay. He had a hypothesis
p35
aVthat was way outside the box for his time, in the late 1800s.
p36
aVHe thought yellow fever was not transmitted by dirty clothing.
p37
aVHe thought it was transmitted by mosquitos.
p38
aVAnd they laughed at him. For 20 years, they called this guy
p39
aV"the mosquito man." But he ran an experiment in people,
p40
aVright? He had this hypothesis, and he tested it in people.
p41
aVSo he got volunteers to go move to Cuba and live in tents
p42
aVand be voluntarily infected with yellow fever.
p43
aVSo some of the people in some of the tents had dirty clothes
p44
aVand some of the people were in tents that were full
p45
aVof mosquitos that had been exposed to yellow fever.
p46
aVAnd it definitively proved that it wasn't this magic dust
p47
aVcalled fomites in your clothes that caused yellow fever.
p48
aVBut it wasn't until we tested it in people that we actually knew.
p49
aVAnd this is what those people signed up for.
p50
aVThis is what it looked like to have yellow fever in Cuba
p51
aVat that time. You suffered in a tent, in the heat, alone,
p52
aVand you probably died.
p53
aVBut people volunteered for this.
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd it's not just a cool example of a scientific design
p56
aVof experiment in theory. They also did this beautiful thing.
p57
aVThey signed this document, and it's called an informed consent document.
p58
aVAnd informed consent is an idea that we should be
p59
aVvery proud of as a society, right? It's something that
p60
aVseparates us from the Nazis at Nuremberg,
p61
aVenforced medical experimentation. It's the idea
p62
aVthat agreement to join a study without understanding isn't agreement.
p63
aVIt's something that protects us from harm, from hucksters,
p64
aVfrom people that would try to hoodwink us into a clinical
p65
aVstudy that we don't understand, or that we don't agree to.
p66
aVAnd so you put together the thread of narrative hypothesis,
p67
aVexperimentation in humans, and informed consent,
p68
aVand you get what we call clinical study, and it's how we do
p69
aVthe vast majority of medical work. It doesn't really matter
p70
aVif you're in the north, the south, the east, the west.
p71
aVClinical studies form the basis of how we investigate,
p72
aVso if we're going to look at a new drug, right,
p73
aVwe test it in people, we draw blood, we do experiments,
p74
aVand we gain consent for that study, to make sure
p75
aVthat we're not screwing people over as part of it.
p76
aa(lp77
VBut the world is changing around the clinical study,
p78
aVwhich has been fairly well established for tens of years
p79
aVif not 50 to 100 years.
p80
aVSo now we're able to gather data about our genomes,
p81
aVbut, as we saw earlier, our genomes aren't dispositive.
p82
aVWe're able to gather information about our environment.
p83
aVAnd more importantly, we're able to gather information
p84
aVabout our choices, because it turns out that what we think of
p85
aVas our health is more like the interaction of our bodies,
p86
aVour genomes, our choices and our environment.
p87
aVAnd the clinical methods that we've got aren't very good
p88
aVat studying that because they are based on the idea
p89
aVof person-to-person interaction. You interact
p90
aVwith your doctor and you get enrolled in the study.
p91
aVSo this is my grandfather. I actually never met him,
p92
aVbut he's holding my mom, and his genes are in me, right?
p93
aVHis choices ran through to me. He was a smoker,
p94
aVlike most people were. This is my son.
p95
aVSo my grandfather's genes go all the way through to him,
p96
aVand my choices are going to affect his health.
p97
aVThe technology between these two pictures
p98
aVcannot be more different, but the methodology
p99
aVfor clinical studies has not radically changed over that time period.
p100
aVWe just have better statistics.
p101
aVThe way we gain informed consent was formed in large part
p102
aVafter World War II, around the time that picture was taken.
p103
aVThat was 70 years ago, and the way we gain informed consent,
p104
aVthis tool that was created to protect us from harm,
p105
aVnow creates silos. So the data that we collect
p106
aVfor prostate cancer or for Alzheimer's trials
p107
aVgoes into silos where it can only be used
p108
aVfor prostate cancer or for Alzheimer's research.
p109
aVRight? It can't be networked. It can't be integrated.
p110
aVIt cannot be used by people who aren't credentialed.
p111
aVSo a physicist can't get access to it without filing paperwork.
p112
aVA computer scientist can't get access to it without filing paperwork.
p113
aVComputer scientists aren't patient. They don't file paperwork.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd this is an accident. These are tools that we created
p116
aVto protect us from harm, but what they're doing
p117
aVis protecting us from innovation now.
p118
aVAnd that wasn't the goal. It wasn't the point. Right?
p119
aVIt's a side effect, if you will, of a power we created
p120
aVto take us for good.
p121
aVAnd so if you think about it, the depressing thing is that
p122
aVFacebook would never make a change to something
p123
aVas important as an advertising algorithm
p124
aVwith a sample size as small as a Phase III clinical trial.
p125
aVWe cannot take the information from past trials
p126
aVand put them together to form statistically significant samples.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd that sucks, right? So 45 percent of men develop
p129
aVcancer. Thirty-eight percent of women develop cancer.
p130
aVOne in four men dies of cancer.
p131
aVOne in five women dies of cancer, at least in the United States.
p132
aVAnd three out of the four drugs we give you
p133
aVif you get cancer fail. And this is personal to me.
p134
aVMy sister is a cancer survivor.
p135
aVMy mother-in-law is a cancer survivor. Cancer sucks.
p136
aVAnd when you have it, you don't have a lot of privacy
p137
aVin the hospital. You're naked the vast majority of the time.
p138
aVPeople you don't know come in and look at you and poke you and prod you,
p139
aVand when I tell cancer survivors that this tool we created
p140
aVto protect them is actually preventing their data from being used,
p141
aVespecially when only three to four percent of people
p142
aVwho have cancer ever even sign up for a clinical study,
p143
aVtheir reaction is not, "Thank you, God, for protecting my privacy."
p144
aVIt's outrage
p145
aVthat we have this information and we can't use it.
p146
aVAnd it's an accident.
p147
aVSo the cost in blood and treasure of this is enormous.
p148
aVTwo hundred and twenty-six billion a year is spent on cancer in the United States.
p149
aVFifteen hundred people a day die in the United States.
p150
aVAnd it's getting worse.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo the good news is that some things have changed,
p153
aVand the most important thing that's changed
p154
aVis that we can now measure ourselves in ways
p155
aVthat used to be the dominion of the health system.
p156
aVSo a lot of people talk about it as digital exhaust.
p157
aVI like to think of it as the dust that runs along behind my kid.
p158
aVWe can reach back and grab that dust,
p159
aVand we can learn a lot about health from it, so if our choices
p160
aVare part of our health, what we eat is a really important
p161
aVaspect of our health. So you can do something very simple
p162
aVand basic and take a picture of your food,
p163
aVand if enough people do that, we can learn a lot about
p164
aVhow our food affects our health.
p165
aVOne interesting thing that came out of this \u2014 this is an app for iPhones called The Eatery \u2014
p166
aVis that we think our pizza is significantly healthier
p167
aVthan other people's pizza is. Okay? (Laughter)
p168
aVAnd it seems like a trivial result, but this is the sort of research
p169
aVthat used to take the health system years
p170
aVand hundreds of thousands of dollars to accomplish.
p171
aVIt was done in five months by a startup company of a couple of people.
p172
aVI don't have any financial interest in it.
p173
aa(lp174
VBut more nontrivially, we can get our genotypes done,
p175
aVand although our genotypes aren't dispositive, they give us clues.
p176
aVSo I could show you mine. It's just A's, T's, C's and G's.
p177
aVThis is the interpretation of it. As you can see,
p178
aVI carry a 32 percent risk of prostate cancer,
p179
aV22 percent risk of psoriasis and a 14 percent risk of Alzheimer's disease.
p180
aVSo that means, if you're a geneticist, you're freaking out,
p181
aVgoing, "Oh my God, you told everyone you carry the ApoE E4 allele. What's wrong with you?"
p182
aVRight? When I got these results, I started talking to doctors,
p183
aVand they told me not to tell anyone, and my reaction is,
p184
aV"Is that going to help anyone cure me when I get the disease?"
p185
aVAnd no one could tell me yes.
p186
aVAnd I live in a web world where, when you share things,
p187
aVbeautiful stuff happens, not bad stuff.
p188
aVSo I started putting this in my slide decks,
p189
aVand I got even more obnoxious, and I went to my doctor,
p190
aVand I said, "I'd like to actually get my bloodwork.
p191
aVPlease give me back my data." So this is my most recent bloodwork.
p192
aVAs you can see, I have high cholesterol.
p193
aVI have particularly high bad cholesterol, and I have some
p194
aVbad liver numbers, but those are because we had a dinner party with a lot of good wine
p195
aVthe night before we ran the test. (Laughter)
p196
aVRight. But look at how non-computable this information is.
p197
aVThis is like the photograph of my granddad holding my mom
p198
aVfrom a data perspective, and I had to go into the system
p199
aVand get it out.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo the thing that I'm proposing we do here
p202
aVis that we reach behind us and we grab the dust,
p203
aVthat we reach into our bodies and we grab the genotype,
p204
aVand we reach into the medical system and we grab our records,
p205
aVand we use it to build something together, which is a commons.
p206
aVAnd there's been a lot of talk about commonses, right,
p207
aVhere, there, everywhere, right. A commons is nothing more
p208
aVthan a public good that we build out of private goods.
p209
aVWe do it voluntarily, and we do it through standardized
p210
aVlegal tools. We do it through standardized technologies.
p211
aVRight. That's all a commons is. It's something that we build
p212
aVtogether because we think it's important.
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd a commons of data is something that's really unique,
p215
aVbecause we make it from our own data. And although
p216
aVa lot of people like privacy as their methodology of control
p217
aVaround data, and obsess around privacy, at least
p218
aVsome of us really like to share as a form of control,
p219
aVand what's remarkable about digital commonses
p220
aVis you don't need a big percentage if your sample size is big enough
p221
aVto generate something massive and beautiful.
p222
aVSo not that many programmers write free software,
p223
aVbut we have the Apache web server.
p224
aVNot that many people who read Wikipedia edit,
p225
aVbut it works. So as long as some people like to share
p226
aVas their form of control, we can build a commons, as long as we can get the information out.
p227
aVAnd in biology, the numbers are even better.
p228
aVSo Vanderbilt ran a study asking people, we'd like to take
p229
aVyour biosamples, your blood, and share them in a biobank,
p230
aVand only five percent of the people opted out.
p231
aVI'm from Tennessee. It's not the most science-positive state
p232
aVin the United States of America. (Laughter)
p233
aVBut only five percent of the people wanted out.
p234
aVSo people like to share, if you give them the opportunity and the choice.
p235
aa(lp236
VAnd the reason that I got obsessed with this, besides the obvious family aspects,
p237
aVis that I spend a lot of time around mathematicians,
p238
aVand mathematicians are drawn to places where there's a lot of data
p239
aVbecause they can use it to tease signals out of noise.
p240
aVAnd those correlations that they can tease out, they're not
p241
aVnecessarily causal agents, but math, in this day and age,
p242
aVis like a giant set of power tools
p243
aVthat we're leaving on the floor, not plugged in in health,
p244
aVwhile we use hand saws.
p245
aVIf we have a lot of shared genotypes, and a lot of shared
p246
aVoutcomes, and a lot of shared lifestyle choices,
p247
aVand a lot of shared environmental information, we can start
p248
aVto tease out the correlations between subtle variations
p249
aVin people, the choices they make and the health that they create as a result of those choices,
p250
aVand there's open-source infrastructure to do all of this.
p251
aVSage Bionetworks is a nonprofit that's built a giant math system
p252
aVthat's waiting for data, but there isn't any.
p253
aa(lp254
VSo that's what I do. I've actually started what we think is
p255
aVthe world's first fully digital, fully self-contributed,
p256
aVunlimited in scope, global in participation, ethically approved
p257
aVclinical research study where you contribute the data.
p258
aVSo if you reach behind yourself and you grab the dust,
p259
aVif you reach into your body and grab your genome,
p260
aVif you reach into the medical system and somehow extract your medical record,
p261
aVyou can actually go through an online informed consent process \u2014
p262
aVbecause the donation to the commons must be voluntary
p263
aVand it must be informed \u2014 and you can actually upload
p264
aVyour information and have it syndicated to the
p265
aVmathematicians who will do this sort of big data research,
p266
aVand the goal is to get 100,000 in the first year
p267
aVand a million in the first five years so that we have
p268
aVa statistically significant cohort that you can use to take
p269
aVsmaller sample sizes from traditional research
p270
aVand map it against,
p271
aVso that you can use it to tease out those subtle correlations
p272
aVbetween the variations that make us unique
p273
aVand the kinds of health that we need to move forward as a society.
p274
aa(lp275
VAnd I've spent a lot of time around other commons.
p276
aVI've been around the early web. I've been around
p277
aVthe early creative commons world, and there's four things
p278
aVthat all of these share, which is, they're all really simple.
p279
aVAnd so if you were to go to the website and enroll in this study,
p280
aVyou're not going to see something complicated.
p281
aVBut it's not simplistic. These things are weak intentionally,
p282
aVright, because you can always add power and control to a system,
p283
aVbut it's very difficult to remove those things if you put them in at the beginning,
p284
aVand so being simple doesn't mean being simplistic,
p285
aVand being weak doesn't mean weakness.
p286
aVThose are strengths in the system.
p287
aa(lp288
VAnd open doesn't mean that there's no money.
p289
aVClosed systems, corporations, make a lot of money
p290
aVon the open web, and they're one of the reasons why the open web lives
p291
aVis that corporations have a vested interest in the openness
p292
aVof the system.
p293
aVAnd so all of these things are part of the clinical study that we've created,
p294
aVso you can actually come in, all you have to be is 14 years old,
p295
aVwilling to sign a contract that says I'm not going to be a jerk,
p296
aVbasically, and you're in.
p297
aVYou can start analyzing the data.
p298
aVYou do have to solve a CAPTCHA as well. (Laughter)
p299
aVAnd if you'd like to build corporate structures on top of it,
p300
aVthat's okay too. That's all in the consent,
p301
aVso if you don't like those terms, you don't come in.
p302
aVIt's very much the design principles of a commons
p303
aVthat we're trying to bring to health data.
p304
aVAnd the other thing about these systems is that it only takes
p305
aVa small number of really unreasonable people working together
p306
aVto create them. It didn't take that many people
p307
aVto make Wikipedia Wikipedia, or to keep it Wikipedia.
p308
aVAnd we're not supposed to be unreasonable in health,
p309
aVand so I hate this word "patient."
p310
aVI don't like being patient when systems are broken,
p311
aVand health care is broken.
p312
aVI'm not talking about the politics of health care, I'm talking about the way we scientifically approach health care.
p313
aVSo I don't want to be patient. And the task I'm giving to you
p314
aVis to not be patient. So I'd like you to actually try,
p315
aVwhen you go home, to get your data.
p316
aVYou'll be shocked and offended and, I would bet, outraged,
p317
aVat how hard it is to get it.
p318
aVBut it's a challenge that I hope you'll take,
p319
aVand maybe you'll share it. Maybe you won't.
p320
aVIf you don't have anyone in your family who's sick,
p321
aVmaybe you wouldn't be unreasonable. But if you do,
p322
aVor if you've been sick, then maybe you would.
p323
aVAnd we're going to be able to do an experiment in the next several months
p324
aVthat lets us know exactly how many unreasonable people are out there.
p325
aVSo this is the Athena Breast Health Network. It's a study
p326
aVof 150,000 women in California, and they're going to
p327
aVreturn all the data to the participants of the study
p328
aVin a computable form, with one-clickability to load it into
p329
aVthe study that I've put together. So we'll know exactly
p330
aVhow many people are willing to be unreasonable.
p331
aa(lp332
VSo what I'd end [with] is,
p333
aVthe most beautiful thing I've learned since I quit my job
p334
aValmost a year ago to do this, is that it really doesn't take
p335
aVvery many of us to achieve spectacular results.
p336
aVYou just have to be willing to be unreasonable,
p337
aVand the risk we're running is not the risk those 14 men
p338
aVwho got yellow fever ran. Right?
p339
aVIt's to be naked, digitally, in public. So you know more
p340
aVabout me and my health than I know about you. It's asymmetric now.
p341
aVAnd being naked and alone can be terrifying.
p342
aVBut to be naked in a group, voluntarily, can be quite beautiful.
p343
aVAnd so it doesn't take all of us.
p344
aVIt just takes all of some of us. Thank you.

VPeople are living longer and societies are getting grayer.
p5
aVYou hear about it all the time.
p6
aVYou read about it in your newspapers.
p7
aVYou hear about it on your television sets.
p8
aVSometimes, I'm concerned
p9
aVthat we hear about it so much that we've come to accept longer lives
p10
aVwith a kind of a complacency, even ease.
p11
aVBut make no mistake, longer lives can \u2014
p12
aVand, I believe, will improve quality of life at all ages.
p13
aa(lp14
VNow to put this in perspective, let me just zoom out for a minute.
p15
aVMore years were added to average life expectancy in the 20th century
p16
aVthan all years added across all prior millennia
p17
aVof human evolution combined.
p18
aVIn the blink of an eye,
p19
aVwe nearly doubled the length of time that we're living.
p20
aVSo if you ever feel like you don't have this aging thing quite pegged,
p21
aVdon't kick yourself.
p22
aVIt's brand new.
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd because fertility rates fell across that very same period
p25
aVthat life expectancy was going up,
p26
aVthat pyramid that has always represented the distribution of age in the population,
p27
aVwith many young ones at the bottom winnowed to a tiny peak of older people
p28
aVwho make it and survive to old age,
p29
aVis being reshaped into a rectangle.
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd now, if you're the kind of person
p32
aVwho can get chills from population statistics,
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
Vthese are the ones that should do it.
p37
aVBecause what that means
p38
aVis that for the first time in the history of the species,
p39
aVthe majority of babies born in the developed world
p40
aVare having the opportunity to grow old.
p41
aa(lp42
VHow did this happen?
p43
aVWell, we're no genetically hardier than our ancestors were 10,000 years ago.
p44
aVThis increase in life expectancy is the remarkable product of culture \u2014
p45
aVthe crucible that holds science and technology
p46
aVand wide-scale changes in behavior that improve health and well-being.
p47
aVThrough cultural changes, our ancestors largely eliminated early death
p48
aVso that people can now live out their full lives.
p49
aa(lp50
VNow there are problems associated with aging \u2014
p51
aVdiseases, poverty, loss of social status.
p52
aVIt's hardly time to rest on our laurels.
p53
aVBut the more we learn about aging,
p54
aVthe clearer it becomes that a sweeping downward course
p55
aVis grossly inaccurate.
p56
aVAging brings some rather remarkable improvements \u2014
p57
aVincreased knowledge, expertise \u2014
p58
aVand emotional aspects of life improve.
p59
aVThat's right, older people are happy.
p60
aVThey're happier than middle-aged people, and younger people, certainly.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VStudy after study is coming to the same conclusion.
p65
aa(lp66
VThe CDC recently conducted a survey
p67
aVwhere they asked respondents simply to tell them
p68
aVwhether they experienced significant psychological distress
p69
aVin the previous week.
p70
aVAnd fewer older people answered affirmatively to that question
p71
aVthan middle-aged people, and younger people as well.
p72
aVAnd a recent Gallup poll asked participants
p73
aVhow much stress and worry and anger they had experienced the previous day.
p74
aVAnd stress, worry, anger
p75
aVall decrease with age.
p76
aa(lp77
VNow social scientists call this the paradox of aging.
p78
aVI mean, after all, aging is not a piece of cake.
p79
aVSo we've asked all sorts of questions to see if we could undo this finding.
p80
aVWe've asked whether it may be that the current generations of older people
p81
aVare and always have been the greatest generations.
p82
aVThat is that younger people today may not typically experience
p83
aVthese improvements as they grow older.
p84
aVWe've asked,
p85
aVwell, maybe older people are just trying to put a positive spin
p86
aVon an otherwise depressing existence.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VBut the more we've tried to disavow this finding,
p91
aVthe more evidence we find to support it.
p92
aa(lp93
VYears ago, my colleagues and I embarked on a study
p94
aVwhere we followed the same group of people over a 10-year period.
p95
aVOriginally, the sample was aged 18 to 94.
p96
aVAnd we studied whether and how their emotional experiences changed
p97
aVas they grew older.
p98
aVOur participants would carry electronic pagers
p99
aVfor a week at a time,
p100
aVand we'd page them throughout the day and evenings at random times.
p101
aVAnd every time we paged them,
p102
aVwe'd ask them to answer several questions \u2014
p103
aV"On a one to seven scale, how happy are you right now?"
p104
aV"How sad are you right now?"
p105
aV"How frustrated are you right now?" \u2014
p106
aVso that we could get a sense of the kinds of emotions and feelings they were having
p107
aVin their day-to-day lives.
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd using this intense study of individuals,
p110
aVwe find that it's not one particular generation
p111
aVthat's doing better than the others,
p112
aVbut the same individuals over time
p113
aVcome to report relatively greater positive experience.
p114
aVNow you see this slight downturn at very advanced ages.
p115
aVAnd there is a slight downturn.
p116
aVBut at no point does it return to the levels we see in early adulthood.
p117
aa(lp118
VNow it's really too simplistic to say that older people are "happy."
p119
aVIn our study, they are more positive.
p120
aVBut they're also more likely than younger people
p121
aVto experience mixed emotions \u2014
p122
aVsadness at the same time you experience happiness;
p123
aVyou know, that tear in the eye when you're smiling at a friend.
p124
aVAnd other research has shown that older people seem to engage with sadness
p125
aVmore comfortably.
p126
aVThey're more accepting of sadness than younger people are.
p127
aVAnd we suspect that this may help to explain
p128
aVwhy older people are better than younger people
p129
aVat solving hotly charged emotional conflicts and debates.
p130
aVOlder people can view injustice with compassion,
p131
aVbut not despair.
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd all things being equal,
p134
aVolder people direct their cognitive resources, like attention and memory,
p135
aVto positive information more than negative.
p136
aVIf we show older, middle-aged, younger people images,
p137
aVlike the ones you see on the screen,
p138
aVand we later ask them to recall all the images that they can,
p139
aVolder people, but not younger people,
p140
aVremember more positive images than negative images.
p141
aVWe've asked older and younger people to view faces in laboratory studies,
p142
aVsome frowning, some smiling.
p143
aVOlder people look toward the smiling faces and away from the frowning, angry faces.
p144
aVIn day-to-day life, this translates into greater enjoyment and satisfaction.
p145
aa(lp146
VBut as social scientists, we continue to ask about possible alternatives.
p147
aVWe've said, well, maybe older people report more positive emotions
p148
aVbecause they're cognitively impaired.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VWe've said, could it be
p153
aVthat positive emotions are simply easier to process than negative emotions,
p154
aVand so you switch to the positive emotions?
p155
aVMaybe our neural centers in our brain
p156
aVare degraded such that we're unable to process negative emotions anymore.
p157
aVBut that's not the case.
p158
aVThe most mentally sharp older adults
p159
aVare the ones who show this positivity effect the most.
p160
aVAnd under conditions where it really matters,
p161
aVolder people do process the negative information
p162
aVjust as well as the positive information.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo how can this be?
p165
aVWell, in our research,
p166
aVwe've found that these changes are grounded fundamentally
p167
aVin the uniquely human ability to monitor time \u2014
p168
aVnot just clock time and calendar time, but lifetime.
p169
aVAnd if there's a paradox of aging,
p170
aVit's that recognizing that we won't live forever
p171
aVchanges our perspective on life in positive ways.
p172
aVWhen time horizons are long and nebulous, as they typically are in youth,
p173
aVpeople are constantly preparing,
p174
aVtrying to soak up all the information they possibly can,
p175
aVtaking risks, exploring.
p176
aVWe might spend time with people we don't even like
p177
aVbecause it's somehow interesting.
p178
aVWe might learn something unexpected.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VWe go on blind dates.
p183
aa(lp184
V(Laughter)
p185
aa(lp186
VYou know, after all,
p187
aVif it doesn't work out, there's always tomorrow.
p188
aVPeople over 50 don't go on blind dates.
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
VAs we age, our time horizons grow shorter and our goals change.
p193
aVWhen we recognize that we don't have all the time in the world,
p194
aVwe see our priorities most clearly.
p195
aVWe take less notice of trivial matters.
p196
aVWe savor life.
p197
aVWe're more appreciative,
p198
aVmore open to reconciliation.
p199
aVWe invest in more emotionally important parts of life,
p200
aVand life gets better,
p201
aVso we're happier day-to-day.
p202
aVBut that same shift in perspective
p203
aVleads us to have less tolerance than ever for injustice.
p204
aa(lp205
VBy 2015,
p206
aVthere will be more people in the United States
p207
aVover the age of 60 than under 15.
p208
aVWhat will happen to societies that are top-heavy with older people?
p209
aVThe numbers won't determine the outcome.
p210
aVCulture will.
p211
aVIf we invest in science and technology
p212
aVand find solutions for the real problems that older people face
p213
aVand we capitalize on the very real strengths of older people,
p214
aVthen added years of life can dramatically improve quality of life at all ages.
p215
aVSocieties with millions of talented, emotionally stable citizens
p216
aVwho are healthier and better educated than any generations before them,
p217
aVarmed with knowledge about the practical matters of life
p218
aVand motivated to solve the big issues
p219
aVcan be better societies than we have ever known.
p220
aa(lp221
VMy father, who is 92, likes to say,
p222
aV"Let's stop talking only about how to save the old folks
p223
aVand start talking about how to get them to save us all."
p224
aa(lp225
VThank you.

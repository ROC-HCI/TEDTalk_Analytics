VWhen I was young, I prided myself as a nonconformist
p5
aVin the conservative U.S. state I live in, Kansas.
p6
aVI didn't follow along with the crowd.
p7
aVI wasn't afraid to try weird clothing trends or hairstyles.
p8
aVI was outspoken and extremely social.
p9
aVEven these pictures and postcards  of my London semester abroad 16 years ago
p10
aVshow that I obviously didn't care if I was perceived as weird or different.
p11
aV(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VBut that same year  I was in London, 16 years ago,
p14
aVI realized something about myself that actually was somewhat unique,
p15
aVand that changed everything.
p16
aVI became the opposite of who I thought I once was.
p17
aVI stayed in my room instead of socializing.
p18
aVI stopped engaging in clubs and leadership activities.
p19
aVI didn't want to stand out in the crowd anymore.
p20
aVI told myself it was because I was growing up and maturing,
p21
aVnot that I was suddenly looking for acceptance.
p22
aVI had always assumed I was immune to needing acceptance.
p23
aVAfter all, I was a bit unconventional.
p24
aVBut I realize now
p25
aVthat the moment I realized something was different about me
p26
aVwas the exact same moment that I began conforming and hiding.
p27
aa(lp28
VHiding is a progressive habit,
p29
aVand once you start hiding,
p30
aVit becomes harder and harder to step forward and speak out.
p31
aVIn fact, even now,
p32
aVwhen I was talking to people about what this talk was about,
p33
aVI made up a cover story
p34
aVand I even hid the truth about my TED Talk.
p35
aVSo it is fitting and scary
p36
aVthat I have returned  to this city 16 years later
p37
aVand I have chosen this stage to finally stop hiding.
p38
aVWhat have I been hiding for 16 years?
p39
aVI am a lesbian.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Applause)
p42
aa(lp43
VThank you.
p44
aa(lp45
VI've struggled to say those words,
p46
aVbecause I didn't want to be defined by them.
p47
aVEvery time I would think about coming out in the past,
p48
aVI would think to myself, but I just want to be known as Morgana,
p49
aVuniquely Morgana,
p50
aVbut not "my lesbian friend Morgana," or "my gay coworker Morgana."
p51
aVJust Morgana.
p52
aa(lp53
VFor those of you from large metropolitan areas,
p54
aVthis may not seem like a big deal to you.
p55
aVIt may seem strange  that I have suppressed the truth
p56
aVand hidden this for so long.
p57
aVBut I was paralyzed by my fear of not being accepted.
p58
aVAnd I'm not alone, of course.
p59
aVA 2013 Deloitte study found that a surprisingly large number of people
p60
aVhide aspects of their identity.
p61
aVOf all the employees they surveyed,
p62
aV61 percent reported changing an aspect of their behavior or their appearance
p63
aVin order to fit in at work.
p64
aVOf all the gay, lesbian and bisexual employees,
p65
aV83 percent admitted to changing some aspects of themselves
p66
aVso they would not  appear at work "too gay."
p67
aVThe study found that even in companies
p68
aVwith diversity policies and inclusion programs,
p69
aVemployees struggle to be themselves at work
p70
aVbecause they believe  conformity is critical
p71
aVto their long-term career advancement.
p72
aVAnd while I was surprised that so many people just like me
p73
aVwaste so much energy trying to hide themselves,
p74
aVI was scared when I discovered that my silence
p75
aVhas life-or-death consequences and long-term social repercussions.
p76
aa(lp77
VTwelve years:
p78
aVthe length by which  life expectancy is shortened
p79
aVfor gay, lesbian and bisexual people in highly anti-gay communities
p80
aVcompared to accepting communities.
p81
aVTwelve years reduced life expectancy.
p82
aVWhen I read that in The Advocate  magazine this year,
p83
aVI realized I could no longer afford to keep silent.
p84
aVThe effects of personal stress and social stigmas are a deadly combination.
p85
aVThe study found that gays in anti-gay communities
p86
aVhad higher rates of heart disease, violence and suicide.
p87
aVWhat I once thought was simply a personal matter
p88
aVI realized had a ripple effect
p89
aVthat went into the workplace and out into the community
p90
aVfor every story just like mine.
p91
aVMy choice to hide and not share who I really am
p92
aVmay have inadvertently contributed to this exact same environment
p93
aVand atmosphere of discrimination.
p94
aa(lp95
VI'd always told myself there's no reason to share that I was gay,
p96
aVbut the idea that my silence has social consequences
p97
aVwas really driven home this year when I missed an opportunity
p98
aVto change the atmosphere of discrimination in my own home state of Kansas.
p99
aa(lp100
VIn February, the Kansas House of  Representatives brought up a bill for vote
p101
aVthat would have essentially allowed businesses
p102
aVto use religious freedom as a reason to deny gays services.
p103
aVA former coworker and friend of mine
p104
aVhas a father who serves in the Kansas House of Representatives.
p105
aVHe voted in favor of the bill,
p106
aVin favor of a law that would allow  businesses to not serve me.
p107
aa(lp108
VHow does my friend feel
p109
aVabout lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning people?
p110
aVHow does her father feel?
p111
aVI don't know, because I was never honest  with them about who I am.
p112
aVAnd that shakes me to the core.
p113
aVWhat if I had told her my story years ago?
p114
aVCould she have told  her father my experience?
p115
aVCould I have ultimately helped change his vote?
p116
aVI will never know,
p117
aVand that made me realize I had done nothing
p118
aVto try to make a difference.
p119
aa(lp120
VHow ironic that I work in human resources,
p121
aVa profession that works to welcome,
p122
aVconnect and encourage the development of employees,
p123
aVa profession that advocates that the diversity of society
p124
aVshould be reflected in the workplace,
p125
aVand yet I have done nothing to advocate for diversity.
p126
aVWhen I came to this company one year ago,
p127
aVI thought to myself, this company  has anti-discrimination policies
p128
aVthat protect gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.
p129
aVTheir commitment to diversity is evident through their global inclusion programs.
p130
aVWhen I walk through the doors of this company, I will finally come out.
p131
aVBut I didn't.
p132
aVInstead of taking advantage of the opportunity,
p133
aVI did nothing.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Applause)
p136
aa(lp137
VWhen I was looking through my London journal and scrapbook
p138
aVfrom my London semester abroad 16 years ago,
p139
aVI came across this modified quote from Toni Morrison's book, "Paradise."
p140
aV"There are more scary things inside than outside."
p141
aVAnd then I wrote a note to myself at the bottom:
p142
aV"Remember this."
p143
aVI'm sure I was trying to encourage myself to get out and explore London,
p144
aVbut the message I missed was the need  to start exploring and embracing myself.
p145
aVWhat I didn't realize until all these years later
p146
aVis that the biggest obstacles I will ever have to overcome
p147
aVare my own fears and insecurities.
p148
aVI believe that by facing my fears inside, I will be able to change reality outside.
p149
aVI made a choice today
p150
aVto reveal a part of myself that I have hidden for too long.
p151
aVI hope that this means I will never hide again,
p152
aVand I hope that by coming out today, I can do something to change the data
p153
aVand also to help others who feel different be more themselves and more fulfilled
p154
aVin both their professional and personal lives.
p155
aVThank you.
p156
aV(Applause)

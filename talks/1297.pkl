VOver the last 13 years \u2014
p5
aVone, three, 13 years \u2014
p6
aVI've been part of an exceptional team at InSightec in Israel
p7
aVand partners around the world
p8
aVfor taking this idea, this concept,
p9
aVnoninvasive surgery,
p10
aVfrom the research lab to routine clinical use.
p11
aVAnd this is what I'll tell you about.
p12
aV13 years \u2014
p13
aVfor some of you, you can empathize with that number.
p14
aVFor me, today, on this date,
p15
aVit's like a second bar mitzvah experience.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VSo this dream
p20
aVis really enabled
p21
aVby the convergence
p22
aVof two known technologies.
p23
aVOne is the focused ultrasound,
p24
aVand the other one is the
p25
aVvision-enabled magnetic resonance imaging.
p26
aVSo let's first talk about focused ultrasound.
p27
aVAnd I hold in my hand
p28
aVa tissue-mimicking phantom.
p29
aVIt is made out of silicon.
p30
aVIt is transparent, made just for you.
p31
aVSo you see, it's all intact,
p32
aVcompletely transparent.
p33
aVI'll take you now to the acoustic lab.
p34
aVYou see the phantom within the aquarium.
p35
aVThis is a setup I put in a physics lab.
p36
aVOn the right-hand side,
p37
aVyou see an ultrasonic transducer.
p38
aVSo the ultrasonic transducer
p39
aVemits basically an ultrasonic beam
p40
aVthat focuses inside the phantom.
p41
aVOkay, when you hear the click,
p42
aVthis is when the energy starts to emit
p43
aVand you see a little lesion form
p44
aVinside the phantom.
p45
aVOkay, so everything around it
p46
aVis whole and intact.
p47
aVIt's just a lesion formed inside.
p48
aVSo think about, this is in your brain.
p49
aVWe need to reach a target inside the brain.
p50
aVWe can do it without harming any tissue.
p51
aVSo this is, I think,
p52
aVthe first kosher Hippocratic surgical system.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VOkay, so let's talk a little bit about ultrasound,
p57
aVthe force of ultrasound.
p58
aVYou know all about imaging, right, ultrasound imaging.
p59
aVAnd you know also about lithotripsy \u2014
p60
aVbreaking kidney stones.
p61
aVBut ultrasound can be shaped
p62
aVto be anything in between,
p63
aVbecause it's a mechanical force.
p64
aVBasically, it's a force acting on a tissue
p65
aVthat it transverses.
p66
aVSo you can change the intensity, the frequency,
p67
aVthe duration, the pulse shape of the ultrasound
p68
aVto create anything
p69
aVfrom an airbrush to a hammer.
p70
aVAnd I am going to show you
p71
aVmultiple applications in the medical field
p72
aVthat can be enabled
p73
aVjust by focusing,
p74
aVphysically focusing.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo this idea
p77
aVof harnessing focused ultrasound to treat lesions in the brain
p78
aVis not new at all.
p79
aVWhen I was born, this idea was already conceived
p80
aVby pioneers such as the Fry brothers
p81
aVand Lars Leksell,
p82
aVwho is know actually
p83
aVas the inventor of the gammaknife.
p84
aVBut you may not know
p85
aVthat he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain,
p86
aVnoninvasively,
p87
aVwith focused ultrasound in the '50s.
p88
aVHe failed,
p89
aVso he then invented the gammaknife.
p90
aVAnd it makes you ponder
p91
aVwhy those pioneers failed.
p92
aVAnd there was something fundamental
p93
aVthat they were missing.
p94
aVThey were missing the vision.
p95
aVIt wasn't until the invention of the MR
p96
aVand really the integration of MR
p97
aVwith focused ultrasound
p98
aVthat we could get the feedback \u2014
p99
aVboth the anatomical and the physiological
p100
aVin order to have a completely noninvasive, closed-loop
p101
aVsurgical procedure.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo this is how it looks, you know,
p104
aVthe operating room of the future today.
p105
aVThis is an MR suite with a focused ultrasound system.
p106
aVAnd I will give you several examples.
p107
aVSo the first one is in the brain.
p108
aVOne of the neurological conditions
p109
aVthat can be treated with focused ultrasound
p110
aVare movement disorders,
p111
aVlike Parkinson's or essential tremor.
p112
aVWhat is typical to those conditions,
p113
aVto essential tremor for example,
p114
aVis inability
p115
aVto drink or eat cereal or soup
p116
aVwithout spilling everything all over you,
p117
aVor write legibly so people can understand it,
p118
aVand be really independent in your life
p119
aVwithout the help of others.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo I'd like you to meet John.
p122
aVJohn is a retired professor of history
p123
aVfrom Virginia.
p124
aVSo he suffered from essential tremor for many years.
p125
aVAnd medication didn't help him anymore.
p126
aVAnd many of those patients refused to undergo surgery
p127
aVto have people cut into their brain.
p128
aVAnd about four or five months ago,
p129
aVhe underwent an experimental procedure.
p130
aVIt is approved under an FDAIDE
p131
aVat the University of Virginia
p132
aVin Charlottesville
p133
aVusing focused ultrasound
p134
aVto ablate a point in his thalamus.
p135
aVAnd this is his handwriting.
p136
aV"On June 20th," if you can read it,
p137
aV"2011."
p138
aVThis is his handwriting
p139
aVon the morning of the treatment
p140
aVbefore going into the MR
p141
aVSo now I'll take you through
p142
aV[what] a typical procedure like that looks like,
p143
aV[what] noninvasive surgery looks like.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo we put the patient on the MR table.
p146
aVWe attach a transducer, in this case, to the brain,
p147
aVbut if it will be a different organ,
p148
aVit will be a different transducer attached to the patient.
p149
aVAnd the physician
p150
aVwill then take a regular MR scan.
p151
aVAnd the objective of that?
p152
aVI don't have a pointer here,
p153
aVbut you see the green, sort of rectangle or trapezoid?
p154
aVThis is the sort of general area of the treatment.
p155
aVIt's a safety boundary
p156
aVaround the target.
p157
aVIt's a target in the thalamus.
p158
aVSo once those pictures are acquired
p159
aVand the physician has drawn
p160
aVall the necessary safety limits and so on,
p161
aVhe selects basically a point \u2014
p162
aVyou see the round point in the middle where the cursor is \u2014
p163
aVand he presses this blue button called "sonicate."
p164
aVWe call this instance of injecting the energy,
p165
aVwe call it sonication.
p166
aVThe only handwork the physician does here
p167
aVis moving a mouse.
p168
aVThis is the only device he needs in this treatment.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo he presses "sonicate," and this is what happens.
p171
aVYou see the transducer, the light blue.
p172
aVThere's water in between the skull and the transducer.
p173
aVAnd it does this burst of energy.
p174
aVIt elevates the temperature.
p175
aVWe first need to verify
p176
aVthat we are on target.
p177
aVSo the first sonication
p178
aVis at lower energy.
p179
aVIt doesn't do any damage,
p180
aVbut it elevates the temperature
p181
aVby a few degrees.
p182
aVAnd one of the unique capabilities
p183
aVthat we leverage with the MR
p184
aVis the ability to measure temperature noninvasively.
p185
aVThis is really a unique capability of the MR.
p186
aVIt is not being used
p187
aVin regular diagnostic imaging.
p188
aVBut here we can get
p189
aVboth the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time.
p190
aVAnd you can see the points there on the graph.
p191
aVThe temperature was raised
p192
aVto 43 degrees C temporarily.
p193
aVThis doesn't cause any damage.
p194
aVBut the point is we are right on target.
p195
aVSo once the physician verifies
p196
aVthat the focus spot is on the target he has chosen,
p197
aVthen we move to perform
p198
aVa full-energy ablation
p199
aVlike you see here.
p200
aVAnd you see the temperature rises
p201
aVto like 55 to 60 degrees C.
p202
aVIf you do it for more than a second,
p203
aVit's enough to basically destroy
p204
aVthe proteins of the cells.
p205
aa(lp206
VThis is the outcome from a patient perspective \u2014
p207
aVsame day after the treatment.
p208
aVThis is an immediate relief.
p209
aV(Applause)
p210
aVThank you.
p211
aVJohn is one of [about] a dozen
p212
aVvery heroic, courageous people
p213
aVwho volunteered for the study.
p214
aVAnd you have to understand
p215
aVwhat is in people's mind
p216
aVwhen they are willing to take the risk.
p217
aVAnd this is a quote from John after he wrote it.
p218
aVHe said, "Miraculous."
p219
aVAnd his wife said, "This is the happiest moment of my life."
p220
aVAnd you wonder why.
p221
aVI mean, one of the messages I like to carry over
p222
aVis, what about defending quality of life?
p223
aVI mean, those people lose their independence.
p224
aVThey are dependent on others.
p225
aVAnd John today is fully independent.
p226
aVHe returned to a normal life routine.
p227
aVAnd he also plays golf,
p228
aVlike you do in Virginia
p229
aVwhen you are retired.
p230
aVOkay, so you can see here the spot.
p231
aVIt's like three millimeters in the middle of the brain.
p232
aVThere's no damage outside.
p233
aVHe suffers from no neurodeficit.
p234
aVThere's no recovery needed, no nothing.
p235
aVHe's back to his normal life.
p236
aa(lp237
VLet's move now
p238
aVto a more painful subject.
p239
aVPain is something
p240
aVthat can make your life miserable.
p241
aVAnd people are suffering from all kinds of pain
p242
aVlike neuropathic pain, lower-back pain
p243
aVand cancer pain from bone metastases,
p244
aVwhen the metastases get to your bones,
p245
aVsometimes they are very painful.
p246
aVAll those I've indicated
p247
aVhave already been shown
p248
aVto be successfully treated
p249
aVby focused ultrasound
p250
aVrelieving the pain, again, very fast.
p251
aVAnd I would like to tell you
p252
aVabout PJ.
p253
aVHe's a 78 year-old farmer
p254
aVwho suffered from \u2014 how should I say it? \u2014
p255
aVit's called pain in the butt.
p256
aVHe had metastases in his right buttock,
p257
aVand he couldn't sit
p258
aVeven with medication.
p259
aVHe had to forgo all the farm activities.
p260
aVHe was treated with radiation therapy,
p261
aVstate-of-the-art radiation therapy,
p262
aVbut it didn't help.
p263
aVMany patients like that favor radiation therapy.
p264
aa(lp265
VAnd again, he volunteered
p266
aVto a pivotal study
p267
aVthat we ran worldwide,
p268
aValso in the U.S.
p269
aVAnd his wife actually took him.
p270
aVThey drove like three hours
p271
aVfrom their farm to the hospital.
p272
aVHe had to sit on a cushion,
p273
aVstand still, not move,
p274
aVbecause it was very painful.
p275
aVHe took the treatment,
p276
aVand on the way back,
p277
aVhe drove the truck by himself.
p278
aVSo again, this is an immediate relief.
p279
aVAnd you have to understand
p280
aVwhat those people feel
p281
aVand what their family experiences
p282
aVwhen it happens.
p283
aVHe returned again
p284
aVto his daily routine on the farm.
p285
aVHe rides his tractor.
p286
aVHe rides his horse to their mountain cabin regularly.
p287
aVAnd he has been very happy.
p288
aa(lp289
VBut now, you ask me,
p290
aVbut what about war, the war on cancer?
p291
aVShow us some primary cancer.
p292
aVWhat can be done there?
p293
aVSo I have good news and bad news.
p294
aVThe good news: there's a lot that can be done.
p295
aVAnd it has been shown actually outside of the U.S.
p296
aVAnd doing that in the U.S.
p297
aVis very painful.
p298
aVI don't see, without this nation
p299
aVtaking it as some collective will
p300
aVor something that is a national goal to make that happen,
p301
aVit will not happen.
p302
aVAnd it's not just because of regulation;
p303
aVit's because of the amount of money needed
p304
aVunder the current evidence-based medicine
p305
aVand the size of trials and so on
p306
aVto make it happen.
p307
aa(lp308
VSo the first two applications
p309
aVare breast cancer and prostate cancer.
p310
aVThey were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound.
p311
aVAnd we have better-than-surgery results in breasts.
p312
aVBut I have a message for the men here.
p313
aVWe heard here yesterday Quyen
p314
aVtalking about the adverse event trait
p315
aVin prostate cancer.
p316
aVThere is a unique opportunity now
p317
aVwith focused ultrasound guided by MR,
p318
aVbecause we can actually think about
p319
aVprostate lumpectomy \u2014
p320
aVtreating just the focal lesion
p321
aVand not removing the whole gland,
p322
aVand by that, avoiding all the issues
p323
aVwith potency and incontinence.
p324
aVWell, there are other cancer tumors in the abdomen \u2014
p325
aVquite lethal, very lethal actually \u2014
p326
aVpancreas, liver, kidney.
p327
aVThe challenge there
p328
aVwith a breathing and awake patient \u2014
p329
aVand in all our treatments,
p330
aVthe patient is awake and conscious
p331
aVand speaks with the physician \u2014
p332
aVis you have to teach the MR some tricks
p333
aVhow to do it in real time.
p334
aVAnd this will take time.
p335
aVThis will take two years.
p336
aa(lp337
VBut I have now a message to the ladies.
p338
aVAnd this is, in 2004,
p339
aVthe FDA has approved MR-guided focused ultrasounds
p340
aVfor the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids.
p341
aVWomen suffer from that disease.
p342
aVAll those tumors
p343
aVhave heavy bleeding during periods,
p344
aVabdominal pressure, back pain,
p345
aVfrequent urination.
p346
aVAnd sometimes, they cannot even conceive and become pregnant
p347
aVbecause of the fibroid.
p348
aVThis is Frances.
p349
aVShe was diagnosed with a grapefruit-sized fibroid.
p350
aVThis is a big fibroid.
p351
aVShe was offered a hysterectomy,
p352
aVbut this is an inconceivable proposition
p353
aVfor someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option.
p354
aVSo she elected to undergo a focused ultrasound procedure
p355
aVin 2008.
p356
aVAnd in 2010, she became a first-time mother to a healthy baby.
p357
aVSo new life was born.
p358
aa(lp359
V(Applause)
p360
aa(lp361
VSo in conclusion,
p362
aVI'd like to leave you with actually four messages.
p363
aVOne is, think about the amount
p364
aVof suffering that is saved
p365
aVfrom patients undergoing noninvasive surgery,
p366
aVand also the economical and emotional burden
p367
aVremoved from their families and communities
p368
aVand the society at large \u2014
p369
aVand I think also from their physicians, by the way.
p370
aVAnd the other thing I would like you to think about
p371
aVis the new type of relationship
p372
aVbetween physician and patients
p373
aVwhen you have a patient on the table
p374
aV[who] is awake and can even monitor the treatment.
p375
aVIn all our treatments,
p376
aVthe patient holds a stop sonication button.
p377
aVHe can stop the surgery at any moment.
p378
aa(lp379
VAnd with that note,
p380
aVI would like to thank you for listening.

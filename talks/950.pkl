VThe moment I say "school,"
p5
aVso many memories come back to me.
p6
aVIt's like after every exam, when I walk out,
p7
aVthe teacher would say, "Hey, come.
p8
aVHow did you do?"
p9
aVI would say with a great smile, "I will definitely pass."
p10
aVAnd I didn't understand why,
p11
aVin one hand they say, "Speak the truth,"
p12
aVin the other hand, when you say the truth, they hated you.
p13
aVSo it went on like that,
p14
aVand I didn't know where else to find myself.
p15
aVSo I remember those nights
p16
aVI used to go to sleep
p17
aVwith asking help from [the] Unknown
p18
aVbecause, for some reason,
p19
aVI couldn't believe what my father and mother
p20
aVhanged in the Puja room as a god,
p21
aVbecause my friend's family
p22
aVhad something else as a god.
p23
aVSo I thought, "I guess I'll pray to [the] Unknown
p24
aVand ask help,"
p25
aVand started getting help from everywhere,
p26
aVeach and every corner of my life at that time.
p27
aVMy brothers started giving me a few tips about drawing and painting.
p28
aa(lp29
VThen, when I was in eighth standard
p30
aVaround 13 years old,
p31
aVI started working in a part-time job
p32
aVin one of the signboard artists called Putu.
p33
aVAnd then school also started supporting me.
p34
aV"Oh, he's bad at studies,
p35
aVbut let him send to the drawing competitions."
p36
aVSo it was good to survive with that little tool
p37
aVthat I found to find my own place in school.
p38
aVAnd one of those competitions,
p39
aVI just won a small, little transistor Philips radio.
p40
aVAnd I didn't have the patience to wait
p41
aVuntil I reached home.
p42
aVSo I just switched on in the train, loudly.
p43
aVIf you travel in Indian trains,
p44
aVyou can see people listening to radio
p45
aVand, you know, even from their mobiles.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo at that time \u2014 and I was 13 \u2014
p48
aVand I was listening to just radio,
p49
aVand someone happened to sit next to me,
p50
aVlike these three people are sitting here.
p51
aVYou know, like just adjacent to me.
p52
aVHe just started asking, "Where did you buy the radio? How much is it?"
p53
aVI said, "It's a prize from [an] art competition."
p54
aVAnd he said, "Oh, I teach at a college of arts.
p55
aVI think
p56
aVyou should study in a school of art.
p57
aVYou just quit school and come there."
p58
aVSo, why I'm telling you this,
p59
aVyou know, maybe, you know,
p60
aVwhoever is sitting next to you can change your whole life \u2014 it's possible.
p61
aVIt is that we need we need to be open and fine-tuned.
p62
aVSo that's what made me enter
p63
aV[the] college of arts after three attempts
p64
aVand just continue to inquire
p65
aVwhat I really want to do with art work, or art
p66
aVand finally I'm here in front of you.
p67
aa(lp68
VWhen I look back, you know,
p69
aVon what happened between that time
p70
aVand now here \u2014
p71
aVthe last 10/15 years \u2014
p72
aVI can see that most of the works
p73
aVrevolve around three subjects,
p74
aVbut it was not intentional.
p75
aVAnd I just start out with a trace because I was thinking,
p76
aV"What really makes us?" \u2014 you know,
p77
aVit's actually [the] past, what makes a person.
p78
aVSo I was thinking,
p79
aVbut when you look at the past,
p80
aVthe way to understand the past
p81
aVis only by the traces available,
p82
aVbecause we cannot go back [to] the past.
p83
aVIt can be ruins, or it can be music,
p84
aVor it can be painting or drawing or writing, whatever it is.
p85
aVBut it is just a kind of trace of that time.
p86
aVAnd that fascinated me,
p87
aVto explore that territory.
p88
aVSo I was working on the line,
p89
aVbut instead of working about traces,
p90
aVI started capturing traces.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo here are some of the works I would like to show you.
p93
aVSo this is called "Self In Progress."
p94
aVIt's just a trace of being in this body.
p95
aVSo here, what happened then,
p96
aVyou know \u2014 what I really enjoyed the most
p97
aVis that this sculpture
p98
aVis nothing but a trace of myself.
p99
aVIt's almost like a 3D photograph.
p100
aVSo there is an element of performance,
p101
aVand there is an element of sculpture,
p102
aVand there is an element of feeling one's self, so close to one's self.
p103
aVSo it's almost like fossils for the future.
p104
aVAnd then moved slowly
p105
aVto explore the other possibilities of capturing traces.
p106
aVSo this is what I was talking about, while molding,
p107
aVit's such a great experience,
p108
aVbecause we have freedom of like walking,
p109
aVor moving my hand or, moving around in the space,
p110
aVbut the moment this becomes solid,
p111
aVwhen you cannot move even an inch,
p112
aVbecause this is plaster of Paris, so the moment you pour it it's like liquid;
p113
aVbut after 20 minutes, it's almost like a hard stone.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo this is capturing the trace of a thumbprint
p116
aVbecause, knowingly or unknowingly,
p117
aVwhatever we do, you know, we leave our traces here.
p118
aVSo I just thought, "I'm going to capture
p119
aVthumbprint, footprint,
p120
aVor whatever traces we leave as humans."
p121
aVThis is the trace of fire,
p122
aVthis is the trace of sun.
p123
aVBecause when I was capturing traces, you know,
p124
aVthis thought comes to me always:
p125
aVis it, only when the object touches the thing and it leaves the trace,
p126
aVor is there other ways to capture it?"
p127
aVSo this work is nothing but like \u2014
p128
aVbecause of the focal length of the lens,
p129
aVit just shows what is on the other side.
p130
aVSo I just put the paper on the focal length,
p131
aVwhich was an etching print,
p132
aVthen I got the portrait of [the] sun from sunlight.
p133
aVThis is called "Dawn to Dawn."
p134
aVWhat I did here, I just put like 10 feet [of] paper
p135
aVthen put a coconut rope,
p136
aVand just burnt it.
p137
aVSo it took about 24 hours to get this line.
p138
aVSo wherever the fire is eating the paper,
p139
aVthat's what becomes the work \u2014
p140
aVdetail.
p141
aa(lp142
VEven though we have traces
p143
aVwhen we try to understand them,
p144
aVthe perception and context
p145
aVplay a major role to understand it.
p146
aVSo do we really understand what it is,
p147
aVor are we trying to get
p148
aVwhat we think it is?
p149
aVThen move towards questioning the perception
p150
aVbecause, even though there are traces,
p151
aVwhen you try to understand them, you know you play a major role.
p152
aVSo like let's say even a simple act.
p153
aVHow many of you saw a cow crossing in India
p154
aVwhile you were coming from Bangalore to Mysore?
p155
aVCan you just raise the hand?
p156
aa(lp157
VIf you just ask an opinion
p158
aVof how, everyone can interpret it.
p159
aVLike, let's say, if a schoolteacher says,
p160
aVshe'll simply say, "To get to the other side."
p161
aVWhy the cow was crossing the road, you know.
p162
aVThe answer can be so different if Potter said it.
p163
aVHe would say, "For the greater good."
p164
aVMartin Luther King would say,
p165
aV"I imagine a world where all cows will be free
p166
aVto cross the road,
p167
aVwithout having their motives called into question."
p168
aV(Laughter)
p169
aVImagine Moses comes now, and he sees
p170
aVthe same cow walking around the street.
p171
aVHe would definitely say,
p172
aV"God came down from heaven,
p173
aVand he said unto the cow,
p174
aV'Thou shalt cross the road.'
p175
aVAnd cow crossed the road,
p176
aVand there was much rejoicing as a holy cow."
p177
aV(Laughter)
p178
aVFreud would say,
p179
aV"The fact that you're at all concerned
p180
aVreveals your underlying sexual insecurity."
p181
aV(Laughter)
p182
aVIf we ask Einstein,
p183
aVhe would say, "Whether the cow crossed the road,
p184
aVor the road moved underneath the cow,
p185
aVdepends on your frame of reference."
p186
aV(Laughter)
p187
aVOr Buddha \u2014
p188
aVif he saw the same cow, he would say,
p189
aV"Asking this question denies your own nature [as a] cow."
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
VSo, what we see
p194
aVis just what we think often,
p195
aVand most of the time, we don't see what it is.
p196
aVIt just all depends on one's perception.
p197
aVAnd context, what is really context?
p198
aVYou know, I could just show you this little piece of paper.
p199
aVBecause I always think meaning doesn't really exist.
p200
aVThe meaning of what we create in this world doesn't exist.
p201
aVIt's just created by the mind.
p202
aVIf you look at this piece of paper,
p203
aVthis is the breadth
p204
aVand this is called length.
p205
aVThis is how we've been taught in school.
p206
aVBut if you tear it in the middle \u2014
p207
aVnow, I didn't touch this breadth,
p208
aVbut still, the meaning of this changes.
p209
aVSo what we conceive as a meaning
p210
aVis always not there;
p211
aVit's on the other side,
p212
aVeven when we say dark, light,
p213
aVgood, bad, tall, short \u2014
p214
aVall meaning it doesn't exist in reality.
p215
aVIt's just that being a human,
p216
aVthe way we train to perceive the reality
p217
aVcreates this meaning.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo this work from this period
p220
aVis mostly like \u2014
p221
aVyou know, this is a work called "Light Makes Dark."
p222
aVIt's just captured through from the lamp.
p223
aVSo the lamp is not just giving a light, it's also giving a darkness.
p224
aVSo this is a work of art, which is just trying to explore that.
p225
aVThis is called "Limit Out."
p226
aVThis shows how limited our eye or hearing sense or touch \u2014
p227
aVdo we really see?
p228
aVThis is an exact negative.
p229
aVIt's about six inches deep in the wall,
p230
aVbut it just appears like it's coming out of the wall.
p231
aVYou know the wall is almost like \u2014
p232
aVthis is the first skin, and this is the second,
p233
aVand there's a third, and each creates a meaning.
p234
aVAnd we're just pulling the wall off the gallery.
p235
aVAgain, "Inward Out."
p236
aVIt's a full-figure cast from myself.
p237
aVIt's about eight inches deep.
p238
aa(lp239
VWhen I was doing that, I always wondered since I've worked with creators \u2014
p240
aVand now you know, I've moved to questioning the perception \u2014
p241
aVwhenever I see the bird flying in the sky,
p242
aVit just makes me feel like:
p243
aVis there anything behind, are there any traces up there,
p244
aVwhich as a human, we don't see them?
p245
aVIs there any way to capture the thought
p246
aVinto visual art?
p247
aVI couldn't find it.
p248
aVBut a solution arrived
p249
aVafter being quiet and not working for about six, seven months,
p250
aVin the restroom,
p251
aVwhen I was changing the air freshener
p252
aVthat goes from solid substance to vapor.
p253
aVIt's called Odonil.
p254
aVThis is the work I made out of that material.
p255
aVThe process to get to make the sculpture was interesting,
p256
aVbecause I wrote to Balsara,
p257
aVwho produces that air freshener called Odonil,
p258
aVsaying, "Dear Sir, I am an artist. This is my catalogue.
p259
aVWill you help me to make this sculpture?"
p260
aVThey never wrote back to me.
p261
aVThen I thought, "I will go to the Small Scale Industries
p262
aVFacilitating Unit and ask help."
p263
aVSo I told them, "I'd like to start an air freshener company."
p264
aVThey said, "Of course.
p265
aVThis is the fee for the project report,
p266
aVand we will give you all the details," and they gave.
p267
aVFinally, I went back to them and said,
p268
aV"It's not for starting the company, it's just to make my own work.
p269
aVPlease come for the show."
p270
aVAnd they did.
p271
aVAnd this work is in the Devi Art Foundation in Delhi.
p272
aa(lp273
VIn India, nobody really talks about works of art;
p274
aVthey always talk about the appreciation of art.
p275
aVYou buy this for 3,000 rupees,
p276
aVit'll become 30,000 in two months.
p277
aVThis is the craft that was going on,
p278
aVbut there are a few collectors
p279
aVwho also collect art which can depreciate.
p280
aVAnd this was collected by Anupam \u2014
p281
aVwhich is like, finally in the end, he will not have anything,
p282
aVbecause it will evaporate.
p283
aVSo this is after a few weeks,
p284
aVthis is after a few months.
p285
aVIt's just all about questioning the preconceptions.
p286
aVSo if someone says, "Oh, I see the portrait,"
p287
aVit may not be the portrait after a few months.
p288
aVAnd if they say it's solid,
p289
aVit will not be solid, it will evaporate.
p290
aVAnd if they say they don't get it,
p291
aVthat's also not true,
p292
aVbecause it's in the air.
p293
aVIt's in the same gallery or in the same museum.
p294
aVSo they inhaled it,
p295
aVbut they are not aware of it.
p296
aa(lp297
VWhile I was doing that work,
p298
aVmy mom and my dad,
p299
aVthey were looking at it and they said,
p300
aV"Why do you deal with negative subjects all the time?"
p301
aVAnd I was like, "What do you mean?"
p302
aV"Light makes dark and now evaporating self.
p303
aVDon't you think it remained something about death," they said.
p304
aV"Of course not. For me," I'm thinking,
p305
aV"this is tucked in some small solid,
p306
aVbut the moment it evaporates,
p307
aVit's merged with the whole."
p308
aVBut she said, "No. Still, I don't like it.
p309
aVCan you make something from nothing
p310
aVas a sculptor?"
p311
aVI said, "No, mom. It can't be.
p312
aVBecause we can create
p313
aVa sculpture
p314
aVby gathering dust together,
p315
aVor we can break the sculpture and get the dust,
p316
aVbut there is nowhere that we can bring dust into the universe."
p317
aa(lp318
VSo, I did this work for her.
p319
aVIt's called "Emerging Angel."
p320
aVThis is the first day \u2014
p321
aVit just gives the appearance
p322
aVthat one is becoming the other.
p323
aVSo, the same sculpture
p324
aVafter a few days.
p325
aVThis is after 15/20 days.
p326
aVThrough that small little slit
p327
aVbetween the glass box and the wood,
p328
aVthe air goes underneath the sculpture and creates the other one.
p329
aVThis gave me a greater faith.
p330
aVThat evaporating sculpture gave me a greater faith
p331
aVthat maybe there is many more possibilities
p332
aVto capture [the] invisible.
p333
aa(lp334
VSo what you see now
p335
aVis called "Shadow Foreshadow."
p336
aVAnd what I'd like to tell you
p337
aVis we don't see shadow, and we don't see light too;
p338
aVwe see the source of the light.
p339
aVWe see where it's bouncing, but we don't see [them] as they exist.
p340
aVYou know, that's why the night sky, we see the sky as dark,
p341
aVbut it's filled with light all the time.
p342
aVWhen it's bounced on the moon, we see it.
p343
aVThe same thing in the darkroom.
p344
aVThe little dust particle will again, reflect the light,
p345
aVand we realize the existence of light.
p346
aVSo we don't see dark, we don't see light,
p347
aVwe don't see gravity, we don't see electricity.
p348
aVSo, I just started doing this work
p349
aVto inquire further
p350
aVabout how to sculpt
p351
aVthe space between this object and there.
p352
aVBecause, as a visual artist, if I'm seeing this and I'm seeing that \u2014
p353
aVbut how to sculpt this, you know?
p354
aVIf we sculpt this, this has two reference points.
p355
aVThe skin of this is also representing this.
p356
aVAnd skin at the other end also represents the floor.
p357
aVI did this as an experiment
p358
aVof casting the shadow.
p359
aVSo this is a corrugated box and its shadow.
p360
aVThen the second one \u2014
p361
aVthe moment you bring any invisible into the visible world
p362
aVit will have all the characteristics of the visible existence.
p363
aVSo that produced a shadow.
p364
aVThen I thought, okay, let me sculpt that.
p365
aVThen, again, that becomes an object.
p366
aVAgain, throwing light, then the third one.
p367
aVSo what you see is nothing but shadow
p368
aVof a shadow of a shadow.
p369
aVAnd then again, at that point, there is no shadow.
p370
aVI thought, "Oh, good. Work is finished."
p371
aVYou can see the detail.
p372
aa(lp373
VThis is called "Gravity."
p374
aVIt's called "Breath." It's just two holes on the gallery wall.
p375
aVIt's a false wall, which contains
p376
aVlike 110 cubic feet.
p377
aVSo that hole actually
p378
aVmakes the air come out and go in.
p379
aVSo where it's happening, we can see,
p380
aVbut what is happening will remain invisible only.
p381
aVThis is from the show called "Invisible," at Talwar Gallery.
p382
aVThis is called "Kaayam."
p383
aVDetail.
p384
aa(lp385
VAnd what I'd like to tell you,
p386
aVour senses are so limited \u2014
p387
aVwe cannot hear everything, we cannot see everything.
p388
aVWe don't feel, "I am touching the air,"
p389
aVbut if the breeze is a little more faster, then I can feel it.
p390
aVSo all of our construction of reality
p391
aVis through these limited senses.
p392
aVSo my request was like,
p393
aVis there any way to use all this
p394
aVas just a symbol or a sign?
p395
aVAnd to really get to the point,
p396
aVwe should move beyond, you know,
p397
aVgo to the other side of the wall, like illogic,
p398
aVlike are invisible.
p399
aVBecause when we see someone walks, we see the footprint.
p400
aVBut if we're just cutting that footprint from the whole thing and trying to analyze it,
p401
aVyou will miss the point
p402
aVbecause the actual journey happens between those footprints,
p403
aVand the footprints are nothing but passing time.
p404
aa(lp405
VThank you.

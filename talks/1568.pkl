VIt's a great time to be a molecular biologist. (Laughter)
p5
aVReading and writing DNA code is getting easier
p6
aVand cheaper.
p7
aVBy the end of this year, we'll be able to sequence
p8
aVthe three million bits of information
p9
aVin your genome in less than a day
p10
aVand for less than 1,000 euros.
p11
aVBiotech is probably the most powerful
p12
aVand the fastest-growing technology sector.
p13
aVIt has the power, potentially,
p14
aVto replace our fossil fuels,
p15
aVto revolutionize medicine,
p16
aVand to touch every aspect of our daily lives.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo who gets to do it?
p19
aVI think we'd all be pretty comfortable with
p20
aVthis guy doing it.
p21
aVBut what about
p22
aVthat guy? (Laughter)
p23
aV(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VIn 2009, I first heard about DIYbio.
p26
aVIt's a movement that \u2014 it advocates making biotechnology
p27
aVaccessible to everyone,
p28
aVnot just scientists and people in government labs.
p29
aVThe idea is that if you open up the science
p30
aVand you allow diverse groups to participate,
p31
aVit could really stimulate innovation.
p32
aVPutting technology in the hands of the end user
p33
aVis usually a good idea because they've got the best idea
p34
aVof what their needs are.
p35
aVAnd here's this really sophisticated technology
p36
aVcoming down the road, all these associated
p37
aVsocial, moral, ethical questions,
p38
aVand we scientists are just lousy at explaining to the public
p39
aVjust exactly what it is we're doing in those labs.
p40
aVSo wouldn't it be nice
p41
aVif there was a place in your local neighborhood
p42
aVwhere you could go and learn about this stuff,
p43
aVdo it hands-on?
p44
aVI thought so.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo, three years ago, I got together
p47
aVwith some friends of mine who had similar aspirations
p48
aVand we founded Genspace.
p49
aVIt's a nonprofit, a community biotech lab
p50
aVin Brooklyn, New York,
p51
aVand the idea was people could come,
p52
aVthey could take classes and putter around in the lab
p53
aVin a very open, friendly atmosphere.
p54
aa(lp55
VNone of my previous experience prepared me
p56
aVfor what came next. Can you guess?
p57
aVThe press started calling us.
p58
aVAnd the more we talked about how great it was to increase
p59
aVscience literacy, the more they wanted to talk
p60
aVabout us creating the next Frankenstein,
p61
aVand as a result, for the next six months,
p62
aVwhen you Googled my name,
p63
aVinstead of getting my scientific papers, you got this.
p64
aV["Am I a biohazard?"]
p65
aV(Laughter)
p66
aVIt was pretty depressing.
p67
aVThe only thing that got us through that period
p68
aVwas that we knew that all over the world,
p69
aVthere were other people that were trying to do
p70
aVthe same thing that we were.
p71
aVThey were opening biohacker spaces, and some of them
p72
aVwere facing much greater challenges than we did,
p73
aVmore regulations, less resources.
p74
aVBut now, three years later, here's where we stand.
p75
aVIt's a vibrant, global community of hackerspaces,
p76
aVand this is just the beginning.
p77
aVThese are some of the biggest ones,
p78
aVand there are others opening every day.
p79
aVThere's one probably going to open up in Moscow,
p80
aVone in South Korea,
p81
aVand the cool thing is they each have their own
p82
aVindividual flavor
p83
aVthat grew out of the community they came out of.
p84
aa(lp85
VLet me take you on a little tour.
p86
aVBiohackers work alone.
p87
aVWe work in groups,
p88
aVin big cities \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p89
aVand in small villages.
p90
aVWe reverse engineer lab equipment.
p91
aVWe genetically engineer bacteria.
p92
aVWe hack hardware,
p93
aVsoftware,
p94
aVwetware,
p95
aVand, of course, the code of life.
p96
aVWe like to build things.
p97
aVThen we like to take things apart.
p98
aVWe make things grow.
p99
aVWe make things glow.
p100
aVAnd we make cells dance.
p101
aa(lp102
VThe spirit of these labs, it's open, it's positive,
p103
aVbut, you know, sometimes when people think of us,
p104
aVthe first thing that comes to mind is bio-safety,
p105
aVbio-security, all the dark side stuff.
p106
aVI'm not going to minimize those concerns.
p107
aVAny powerful technology is inherently dual use,
p108
aVand, you know, you get something like
p109
aVsynthetic biology, nanobiotechnology,
p110
aVit really compels you, you have to look at both
p111
aVthe amateur groups but also the professional groups,
p112
aVbecause they have better infrastructure,
p113
aVthey have better facilities,
p114
aVand they have access to pathogens.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo the United Nations did just that, and they recently
p117
aVissued a report on this whole area,
p118
aVand what they concluded was the power of this technology
p119
aVfor positive was much greater than the risk for negative,
p120
aVand they even looked specifically at the DIYbio community,
p121
aVand they noted, not surprisingly, that the press
p122
aVhad a tendency to consistently overestimate our capabilities
p123
aVand underestimate our ethics.
p124
aVAs a matter of fact, DIY people from all over the world,
p125
aVAmerica, Europe, got together last year,
p126
aVand we hammered out a common code of ethics.
p127
aVThat's a lot more than conventional science has done.
p128
aa(lp129
VNow, we follow state and local regulations.
p130
aVWe dispose of our waste properly, we follow
p131
aVsafety procedures, we don't work with pathogens.
p132
aVYou know, if you're working with a pathogen,
p133
aVyou're not part of the biohacker community,
p134
aVyou're part of the bioterrorist community, I'm sorry.
p135
aVAnd sometimes people ask me,
p136
aV"Well, what about an accident?"
p137
aVWell, working with the safe organisms that we normally
p138
aVwork with, the chance of an accident happening
p139
aVwith somebody accidentally creating, like,
p140
aVsome sort of superbug,
p141
aVthat's literally about as probable as a snowstorm
p142
aVin the middle of the Sahara Desert.
p143
aVNow, it could happen,
p144
aVbut I'm not going to plan my life around it.
p145
aa(lp146
VI've actually chosen to take a different kind of risk.
p147
aVI signed up for something called the Personal Genome Project.
p148
aVIt's a study at Harvard where, at the end of the study,
p149
aVthey're going to take my entire genomic sequence,
p150
aVall of my medical information, and my identity,
p151
aVand they're going to post it online for everyone to see.
p152
aVThere were a lot of risks involved that they talked about
p153
aVduring the informed consent portion.
p154
aVThe one I liked the best is,
p155
aVsomeone could download my sequence, go back to the lab,
p156
aVsynthesize some fake Ellen DNA,
p157
aVand plant it at a crime scene. (Laughter)
p158
aVBut like DIYbio, the positive outcomes and
p159
aVthe potential for good for a study like that
p160
aVfar outweighs the risk.
p161
aa(lp162
VNow, you might be asking yourself,
p163
aV"Well, you know, what would I do in a biolab?"
p164
aVWell, it wasn't that long ago we were asking, "Well,
p165
aVwhat would anyone do with a personal computer?"
p166
aVSo this stuff is just beginning.
p167
aVWe're only seeing just the tip of the DNA iceberg.
p168
aVLet me show you what you could do right now.
p169
aVA biohacker in Germany, a journalist, wanted to know
p170
aVwhose dog was leaving little presents on his street?
p171
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p172
aVYep, you guessed it. He threw tennis balls
p173
aVto all the neighborhood dogs, analyzed the saliva,
p174
aVidentified the dog, and confronted the dog owner.
p175
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p176
aVI discovered an invasive species in my own backyard.
p177
aVLooked like a ladybug, right?
p178
aVIt actually is a Japanese beetle.
p179
aVAnd the same kind of technology \u2014
p180
aVit's called DNA barcoding, it's really cool \u2014
p181
aVYou can use it to check if your caviar is really beluga,
p182
aVif that sushi is really tuna, or if that goat cheese
p183
aVthat you paid so much for is really goat's.
p184
aVIn a biohacker space, you can analyze your genome
p185
aVfor mutations.
p186
aVYou can analyze your breakfast cereal for GMO's,
p187
aVand you can explore your ancestry.
p188
aVYou can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere,
p189
aVcollect microbes, see what's up there.
p190
aVYou can make a biocensor out of yeast
p191
aVto detect pollutants in water.
p192
aVYou can make some sort of a biofuel cell.
p193
aVYou can do a lot of things.
p194
aVYou can also do an art science project. Some of these
p195
aVare really spectacular, and they look at social,
p196
aVecological problems from a completely different perspective.
p197
aVIt's really cool.
p198
aa(lp199
VSome people ask me, well, why am I involved?
p200
aVI could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science.
p201
aVThe thing is, there's something in these labs
p202
aVthat they have to offer society that you can't find
p203
aVanywhere else.
p204
aVThere's something sacred about a space where
p205
aVyou can work on a project, and you don't have to justify
p206
aVto anyone that it's going to make a lot of money,
p207
aVthat it's going to save mankind, or even that it's feasible.
p208
aVIt just has to follow safety guidelines.
p209
aVIf you had spaces like this all over the world,
p210
aVit could really change the perception
p211
aVof who's allowed to do biotech.
p212
aVIt's spaces like these that spawned personal computing.
p213
aVWhy not personal biotech?
p214
aVIf everyone in this room got involved,
p215
aVwho knows what we could do?
p216
aVThis is such a new area, and as we say back in Brooklyn,
p217
aVyou ain't seen nothin' yet. (Laughter)

At the lab, amateur and professional scientists conduct award-winning research on projects as diverse as identifying microbes that live in Earth&#39;s atmosphere and (Jorgensen&#39;s own pet project) DNA-barcoding plants, to distinguish between species that look alike but may not be closely related evolutionarily. <em>Fast Company</em> magazine named Genspace one of the world&#39;s &quot;Top 10 innovative companies in education.&quot;</p>", "slug": "ellen_jorgensen", "whotheyare": "Ellen Jorgensen is at the leading edge of the do-it-yourself biotechnology movement, bringing scientific exploration and understanding to the public.", "whatotherssay": "Ellen Jorgensen is helping to democratize biology\\u2014making it less the purview of academics and Big Pharma and more an enterprise accessible to anyone who wants a hands-on scientific experience.", "id": 1289, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/b37e93e144ff677c8bef94ef5020069a5e46c1bf_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "Biohacking -- you can do it, too", "take_action": null, "comments": 15356, "more_resources": null, "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/ef0f90a8553e50076baf9213082481c51a8a90bb_1600x1200.jpg", "description": "We have personal computing -- why not personal biotech?

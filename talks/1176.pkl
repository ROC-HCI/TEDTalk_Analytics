VYou know, what I do is write for children,
p5
aVand I'm probably America's
p6
aVmost widely read children's author, in fact.
p7
aVAnd I always tell people
p8
aVthat I don't want to show up looking like a scientist.
p9
aVYou can have me as a farmer, or in leathers,
p10
aVand no one has ever chose farmer.
p11
aVI'm here today to talk to you
p12
aVabout circles and epiphanies.
p13
aVAnd you know, an epiphany
p14
aVis usually something you find that you dropped someplace.
p15
aVYou've just got to go around the block
p16
aVto see it as an epiphany.
p17
aa(lp18
VThat's a painting of a circle.
p19
aVA friend of mine did that \u2014 Richard Bollingbroke.
p20
aVIt's the kind of complicated circle
p21
aVthat I'm going to tell you about.
p22
aVMy circle began back in the '60s
p23
aVin high school in Stow, Ohio
p24
aVwhere I was the class queer.
p25
aVI was the guy beaten up bloody
p26
aVevery week in the boys' room,
p27
aVuntil one teacher saved my life.
p28
aVShe saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom
p29
aVin the teachers' lounge.
p30
aVShe did it in secret.
p31
aVShe did it for three years.
p32
aVAnd I had to get out of town.
p33
aVI had a thumb, I had 85 dollars,
p34
aVand I ended up in San Francisco, California \u2014
p35
aVmet a lover \u2014
p36
aVand back in the '80s, found it necessary
p37
aVto begin work on AIDS organizations.
p38
aa(lp39
VAbout three or four years ago,
p40
aVI got a phone call in the middle of the night
p41
aVfrom that teacher, Mrs. Posten,
p42
aVwho said, "I need to see you.
p43
aVI'm disappointed
p44
aVthat we never got to know each other as adults.
p45
aVCould you please come to Ohio,
p46
aVand please bring that man
p47
aVthat I know you have found by now.
p48
aVAnd I should mention
p49
aVthat I have pancreatic cancer,
p50
aVand I'd like you to please
p51
aVbe quick about this."
p52
aa(lp53
VWell, the next day we were in Cleveland.
p54
aVWe took a look at her, we laughed, we cried,
p55
aVand we knew that she needed to be in a hospice.
p56
aVWe found her one, we got her there,
p57
aVand we took care of her
p58
aVand watched over her family,
p59
aVbecause it was necessary.
p60
aVIt's something we knew how to do.
p61
aVAnd just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult
p62
aVgot to know me,
p63
aVshe turned into a box of ashes
p64
aVand was placed in my hands.
p65
aVAnd what had happened
p66
aVwas the circle had closed,
p67
aVit had become a circle \u2014
p68
aVand that epiphany I talked about
p69
aVpresented itself.
p70
aa(lp71
VThe epiphany is
p72
aVthat death is a part of life.
p73
aVShe saved my life;
p74
aVI and my partner saved hers.
p75
aVAnd you know, that part of life needs everything
p76
aVthat the rest of life does.
p77
aVIt needs truth and beauty,
p78
aVand I'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today.
p79
aVIt also needs \u2014
p80
aVit needs dignity,
p81
aVlove and pleasure,
p82
aVand it's our job to hand those things out.
p83
aa(lp84
VThank you.

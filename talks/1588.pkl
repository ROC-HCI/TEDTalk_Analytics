VIn 1975, I met in Florence a professor, Carlo Pedretti,
p5
aVmy former professor of art history, and today
p6
aVa world-renowned scholar of Leonardo da Vinci.
p7
aVWell, he asked me if I could find some technological way
p8
aVto unfold a five-centuries-old mystery related to
p9
aVa lost masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci,
p10
aVthe "Battle of Anghiari," which is supposed to be located
p11
aVin the Hall of the 500 in Palazzo Vecchio, in Florence.
p12
aVWell, in the mid-'70s, there were not great opportunities
p13
aVfor a bioengineer like me, especially in Italy, and so
p14
aVI decided, with some researchers from the United States
p15
aVand the University of Florence, to start probing the murals
p16
aVdecorated by Vasari on the long walls of the Hall of the 500
p17
aVsearching for the lost Leonardo.
p18
aa(lp19
VUnfortunately, at that time we did not know that
p20
aVthat was not exactly where we should be looking,
p21
aVbecause we had to go much deeper in, and so the research
p22
aVcame to a halt, and it was only taken up in 2000
p23
aVthanks to the interest and the enthusiasm of the Guinness family.
p24
aVWell, this time, we focused on trying to reconstruct
p25
aVthe way the Hall of the 500 was before the remodeling,
p26
aVand the so-called Sala Grande, which was built in 1494,
p27
aVand to find out the original doors, windows,
p28
aVand in order to do that, we first created a 3D model,
p29
aVand then, with thermography, we went on to discover
p30
aVhidden windows. These are the original windows of the hall
p31
aVof the Sala Grande. We also found out about the height
p32
aVof the ceiling, and we managed to reconstruct, therefore,
p33
aVall the layout of this original hall
p34
aVthe way it was before there came Vasari,
p35
aVand restructured the whole thing,
p36
aVincluding a staircase that was very important
p37
aVin order to precisely place "The Battle of Anghiari"
p38
aVon a specific area of one of the two walls.
p39
aa(lp40
VWell, we also learned that Vasari, who was commissioned
p41
aVto remodel the Hall of the 500 between 1560 and 1574
p42
aVby the Grand Duke Cosimo I of the Medici family,
p43
aVwe have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces
p44
aVspecifically by placing a brick wall in front of it
p45
aVand leaving a small air gap.
p46
aVOne that we [see] here, Masaccio, the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence,
p47
aVso we just said, well maybe, Visari has done something
p48
aVlike that in the case of this great work of art by Leonardo,
p49
aVsince he was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci.
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd so we built some very sophisticated radio antennas
p52
aVjust for probing both walls and searching for an air gap.
p53
aVAnd we did find many on the right panel of the east wall,
p54
aVan air gap, and that's where
p55
aVwe believe "The Battle of Anghiari,"
p56
aVor at least the part that we know has been painted,
p57
aVwhich is called "The Fight for the Standard," should be located.
p58
aa(lp59
VWell, from there, unfortunately,
p60
aVin 2004, the project
p61
aVcame to a halt. Many political reasons.
p62
aVSo I decided to go back to my alma mater,
p63
aVand, at the University of California, San Diego,
p64
aVand I proposed to open up a research center
p65
aVfor engineering sciences for cultural heritage.
p66
aVAnd in 2007, we created CISA3 as a research center
p67
aVfor cultural heritage, specifically art, architecture
p68
aVand archaeology. So students started to flow in,
p69
aVand we started to build technologies, because that's
p70
aVbasically what we also needed in order to move forward
p71
aVand go and do fieldwork.
p72
aa(lp73
VWe came back in the Hall of the 500 in 2011,
p74
aVand this time, with a great group of students,
p75
aVand my colleague, Professor Falko Kuester,
p76
aVwho is now the director at CISA3, and we
p77
aVcame back just since we knew already where to look for
p78
aVto find out if there was still something left.
p79
aVWell, we were confined though, limited, I should rather say,
p80
aVfor several reasons that it's not worth explaining,
p81
aVto endoscopy only, of the many other options we had,
p82
aVand with a 4mm camera attached to it,
p83
aVwe were successful in documenting and taking
p84
aVsome fragments of what it turns out to be
p85
aVa reddish color, black color, and there is some
p86
aVbeige fragments that later on
p87
aVwe ran a much more sophisticated exams,
p88
aVXRF, X-ray diffraction, and the results are very positive
p89
aVso far. It seems to indicate that indeed
p90
aVwe have found some pigments, and since we know for sure
p91
aVthat no other artist has painted on that wall
p92
aVbefore Vasari came in about 60 years later, well,
p93
aVthose pigments are therefore firmly related to mural painting
p94
aVand most likely to Leonardo.
p95
aa(lp96
VWell, we are searching for the highest and highly praised
p97
aVwork of art ever achieved by mankind.
p98
aVAs a matter of fact, this is by far the most important
p99
aVcommission that Leonardo has ever had,
p100
aVand for doing this great masterpiece, he was named
p101
aVthe number one artist influence at the time.
p102
aa(lp103
VI had also had the privilege since the last 37 years
p104
aVto work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me,
p105
aVbut basically to do what? Well, to assess, for example,
p106
aVthe state of conservation. See here the face of the
p107
aVMadonna of the Chair that when just shining a UV light on it
p108
aVyou suddenly see another, different lady,
p109
aVaged lady, I should rather say.
p110
aVThere is a lot of varnish still sitting there, several retouches,
p111
aVand some over cleaning. It becomes very visible.
p112
aa(lp113
VBut also, technology has helped to write new pages
p114
aVof our history, or at least to update pages of our histories.
p115
aVFor example, the "Lady with the Unicorn,"
p116
aVanother painting by Rafael, well, you see the unicorn.
p117
aVA lot has been said and written about the unicorn, but
p118
aVif you take an X-ray of the unicorn, it becomes a puppy dog.
p119
aVAnd \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 no problem, but, unfortunately,
p120
aVcontinuing with the scientific examination of this painting
p121
aVcame out that Rafael did not paint the unicorn,
p122
aVdid not paint the puppy dog, actually left the painting
p123
aVunfinished, so all this writing about the exotic symbol
p124
aVof the unicorn \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 unfortunately,
p125
aVis not very reliable. (Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VWell, also, authenticity. Just think for a moment
p128
aVif science really could move in the field of authenticity
p129
aVof works of art. There would be a cultural revolution
p130
aVto say the least, but also, I would say, a market revolution,
p131
aVlet me add. Take this example:
p132
aVOtto Marseus, nice painting, which is "Still Life"
p133
aVat the Pitti Gallery, and just have an infrared camera peering through,
p134
aVand luckily for art historians, it just was confirmed
p135
aVthat there is a signature of Otto Marseus. It even says
p136
aVwhen it was made and also the location.
p137
aVSo that was a good result. Sometimes, it's not that good,
p138
aVand so, again, authenticity and science could go together
p139
aVand change the way, not attributions being made,
p140
aVbut at least lay the ground for a more objective,
p141
aVor, I should rather say, less subjective attribution,
p142
aVas it is done today.
p143
aa(lp144
VBut I would say the discovery that really caught
p145
aVmy imagination, my admiration, is the incredibly vivid
p146
aVdrawing under this layer, brown layer,
p147
aVof "The Adoration of the Magi." Here you see
p148
aVa handmade setting XYZ scanner with an infrared camera put on it,
p149
aVand just peering through this brown layer
p150
aVof this masterpiece to reveal
p151
aVwhat could have been underneath.
p152
aVWell, this happens to be the most important painting
p153
aVwe have in Italy by Leonardo da Vinci, and
p154
aVlook at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen
p155
aVfor five centuries. Look at these portraits.
p156
aVThey're magnificent. You see Leonardo at work.
p157
aVYou see the geniality of his creation, right directly
p158
aVon the ground layer of the panel, and see
p159
aVthis cool thing, finding, I should rather say,
p160
aVan elephant. (Laughter) Because of this elephant,
p161
aVover 70 new images came out, never seen for centuries.
p162
aVThis was an epiphany. We came to understand
p163
aVand to prove that the brown coating that we see today
p164
aVwas not done by Leonardo da Vinci, which left us
p165
aVonly the other drawing that for five centuries
p166
aVwe were not able to see, so thanks only to technology.
p167
aa(lp168
VWell, the tablet. Well, we thought, well, if we all have
p169
aVthis pleasure, this privilege to see all this,
p170
aVto find all these discoveries, what about for everybody else?
p171
aVSo we thought of an augmented reality application
p172
aVusing a tablet. Let me show you just simulating
p173
aVwhat we could be doing, any of us could be doing,
p174
aVin a museum environment.
p175
aVSo let's say that we go to a museum with a tablet, okay?
p176
aVAnd we just aim the camera of the tablet
p177
aVto the painting that we are interested to see, like this.
p178
aVOkay? And I will just click on it, we pause,
p179
aVand now let me turn to you so the moment the image,
p180
aVor, I should say, the camera, has locked in the painting,
p181
aVthen the images you just saw up there in the drawing
p182
aVare being loaded. And so, see.
p183
aVWe can, as we said, we can zoom in. Then we can scroll.
p184
aVOkay? Let's go and find the elephant.
p185
aVSo all we need is one finger. Just wipe off
p186
aVand we see the elephant. (Applause)
p187
aV(Applause)
p188
aVOkay? And then if we want,
p189
aVwe can continue the scroll to find out, for example,
p190
aVon the staircase, the whole iconography is going
p191
aVto be changed. There are a lot of laymen reconstructing
p192
aVfrom the ruins of an old temple a new temple,
p193
aVand there are a lot of figures showing up. See?
p194
aa(lp195
VThis is not just a curiosity, because it changes
p196
aVnot just the iconography as you see it, but the iconology,
p197
aVthe meaning of the painting,
p198
aVand we believe this is a cool way, easy way,
p199
aVthat everybody could have access to, to become more
p200
aVthe protagonist of your own discovery, and not just
p201
aVbe so passive about it, as we are when we walk through
p202
aVendless rooms of museums.
p203
aV(Applause)
p204
aa(lp205
VAnother concept is the digital clinical chart, which sounds
p206
aVvery obvious if we were to talk about real patients,
p207
aVbut when we talk about works of art, unfortunately,
p208
aVit's never been tapped as an idea.
p209
aVWell, we believe, again, that this should be the beginning,
p210
aVthe very first step, to do real conservation,
p211
aVand allowing us to really explore and to understand
p212
aVeverything related to the state of our conservation,
p213
aVthe technique, materials, and also if, when, and why
p214
aVwe should restore, or, rather, to intervene on
p215
aVthe environment surrounding the painting.
p216
aa(lp217
VWell, our vision is to rediscover
p218
aVthe spirit of the Renaissance, create a new discipline
p219
aVwhere engineering for cultural heritage is actually
p220
aVa symbol of blending art and science together.
p221
aVWe definitely need a new breed of engineers
p222
aVthat will go out and do this kind of work and
p223
aVrediscover for us these values, these cultural values
p224
aVthat we badly need, especially today.
p225
aa(lp226
VAnd if you want to summarize in one just single word,
p227
aVwell, this is what we're trying to do.
p228
aVWe're trying to give a future to our past
p229
aVin order to have a future.
p230
aVAs long as we live a life of curiosity and passion,
p231
aVthere is a bit of Leonardo in all of us. Thank you. (Applause)
p232
aV(Applause)

VI need to start by telling you a little bit
p5
aVabout my social life,
p6
aVwhich I know may not seem relevant,
p7
aVbut it is.
p8
aa(lp9
VWhen people meet me at parties
p10
aVand they find out that I'm an English professor
p11
aVwho specializes in language,
p12
aVthey generally have one of two reactions.
p13
aVOne set of people look frightened. (Laughter)
p14
aVThey often say something like,
p15
aV"Oh, I'd better be careful what I say.
p16
aVI'm sure you'll hear every mistake I make."
p17
aVAnd then they stop talking. (Laughter)
p18
aVAnd they wait for me to go away
p19
aVand talk to someone else.
p20
aVThe other set of people,
p21
aVtheir eyes light up,
p22
aVand they say,
p23
aV"You are just the person I want to talk to."
p24
aVAnd then they tell me about whatever it is
p25
aVthey think is going wrong with the English language.
p26
aV(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VA couple of weeks ago, I was at a dinner party
p29
aVand the man to my right
p30
aVstarted telling me about all the ways
p31
aVthat the Internet is degrading the English language.
p32
aVHe brought up Facebook, and he said,
p33
aV"To defriend? I mean, is that even a real word?"
p34
aa(lp35
VI want to pause on that question:
p36
aVWhat makes a word real?
p37
aVMy dinner companion and I both know
p38
aVwhat the verb "defriend" means,
p39
aVso when does a new word like "defriend"
p40
aVbecome real?
p41
aVWho has the authority to make those kinds
p42
aVof official decisions about words, anyway?
p43
aVThose are the questions I want to talk about today.
p44
aa(lp45
VI think most people, when they say a word isn't real,
p46
aVwhat they mean is, it doesn't appear
p47
aVin a standard dictionary.
p48
aVThat, of course, raises a host of other questions,
p49
aVincluding, who writes dictionaries?
p50
aa(lp51
VBefore I go any further,
p52
aVlet me clarify my role in all of this.
p53
aVI do not write dictionaries.
p54
aVI do, however, collect new words
p55
aVmuch the way dictionary editors do,
p56
aVand the great thing about being a historian
p57
aVof the English language
p58
aVis that I get to call this "research."
p59
aVWhen I teach the history of the English language,
p60
aVI require that students teach me
p61
aVtwo new slang words before I will begin class.
p62
aVOver the years, I have learned
p63
aVsome great new slang this way,
p64
aVincluding "hangry," which \u2014
p65
aV(Applause) \u2014
p66
aVwhich is when you are cranky or angry
p67
aVbecause you are hungry,
p68
aVand "adorkable,"
p69
aVwhich is when you are adorable
p70
aVin kind of a dorky way,
p71
aVclearly, terrific words that fill
p72
aVimportant gaps in the English language.
p73
aV(Laughter)
p74
aVBut how real are they
p75
aVif we use them primarily as slang
p76
aVand they don't yet appear in a dictionary?
p77
aa(lp78
VWith that, let's turn to dictionaries.
p79
aVI'm going to do this as a show of hands:
p80
aVHow many of you still regularly
p81
aVrefer to a dictionary, either print or online?
p82
aVOkay, so that looks like most of you.
p83
aVNow, a second question. Again, a show of hands:
p84
aVHow many of you have ever looked to see
p85
aVwho edited the dictionary you are using?
p86
aVOkay, many fewer.
p87
aVAt some level, we know that there are human hands
p88
aVbehind dictionaries,
p89
aVbut we're really not sure who those hands belong to.
p90
aVI'm actually fascinated by this.
p91
aVEven the most critical people out there
p92
aVtend not to be very critical about dictionaries,
p93
aVnot distinguishing among them
p94
aVand not asking a whole lot of questions
p95
aVabout who edited them.
p96
aVJust think about the phrase
p97
aV"Look it up in the dictionary,"
p98
aVwhich suggests that all dictionaries
p99
aVare exactly the same.
p100
aVConsider the library here on campus,
p101
aVwhere you go into the reading room,
p102
aVand there is a large, unabridged dictionary
p103
aVup on a pedestal in this place of honor and respect
p104
aVlying open so we can go stand before it
p105
aVto get answers.
p106
aa(lp107
VNow, don't get me wrong,
p108
aVdictionaries are fantastic resources,
p109
aVbut they are human
p110
aVand they are not timeless.
p111
aVI'm struck as a teacher
p112
aVthat we tell students to critically question
p113
aVevery text they read, every website they visit,
p114
aVexcept dictionaries,
p115
aVwhich we tend to treat as un-authored,
p116
aVas if they came from nowhere to give us answers
p117
aVabout what words really mean.
p118
aVHere's the thing: If you ask dictionary editors,
p119
aVwhat they'll tell you
p120
aVis they're just trying to keep up with us
p121
aVas we change the language.
p122
aVThey're watching what we say and what we write
p123
aVand trying to figure out what's going to stick
p124
aVand what's not going to stick.
p125
aVThey have to gamble,
p126
aVbecause they want to appear cutting edge
p127
aVand catch the words that are going to make it,
p128
aVsuch as LOL,
p129
aVbut they don't want to appear faddish
p130
aVand include the words that aren't going to make it,
p131
aVand I think a word that they're watching right now
p132
aVis YOLO, you only live once.
p133
aa(lp134
VNow I get to hang out with dictionary editors,
p135
aVand you might be surprised
p136
aVby one of the places where we hang out.
p137
aVEvery January, we go
p138
aVto the American Dialect Society annual meeting,
p139
aVwhere among other things,
p140
aVwe vote on the word of the year.
p141
aVThere are about 200 or 300 people who come,
p142
aVsome of the best known linguists in the United States.
p143
aVTo give you a sense of the flavor of the meeting,
p144
aVit occurs right before happy hour.
p145
aVAnyone who comes can vote.
p146
aVThe most important rule is
p147
aVthat you can vote with only one hand.
p148
aVIn the past, some of the winners have been
p149
aV"tweet" in 2009
p150
aVand "hashtag" in 2012.
p151
aV"Chad" was the word of the year in the year 2000,
p152
aVbecause who knew what a chad was before 2000,
p153
aVand "WMD" in 2002.
p154
aa(lp155
VNow, we have other categories in which we vote too,
p156
aVand my favorite category
p157
aVis most creative word of the year.
p158
aVPast winners in this category have included
p159
aV"recombobulation area,"
p160
aVwhich is at the Milwaukee Airport after security,
p161
aVwhere you can recombobulate.
p162
aV(Laughter)
p163
aVYou can put your belt back on,
p164
aVput your computer back in your bag.
p165
aVAnd then my all-time favorite word at this vote,
p166
aVwhich is "multi-slacking."
p167
aV(Laughter)
p168
aVAnd multi-slacking is the act
p169
aVof having multiple windows up on your screen
p170
aVso it looks like you're working
p171
aVwhen you're actually goofing around on the web.
p172
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p173
aa(lp174
VWill all of these words stick? Absolutely not.
p175
aVAnd we have made some questionable choices,
p176
aVfor example in 2006
p177
aVwhen the word of the year was "Plutoed,"
p178
aVto mean demoted.
p179
aV(Laughter)
p180
aVBut some of the past winners
p181
aVnow seem completely unremarkable,
p182
aVsuch as "app"
p183
aVand "e" as a prefix,
p184
aVand "google" as a verb.
p185
aa(lp186
VNow, a few weeks before our vote,
p187
aVLake Superior State University
p188
aVissues its list of banished words for the year.
p189
aVWhat is striking about this
p190
aVis that there's actually often quite a lot of overlap
p191
aVbetween their list and the list that we are considering
p192
aVfor words of the year,
p193
aVand this is because we're noticing the same thing.
p194
aVWe're noticing words that are coming into prominence.
p195
aVIt's really a question of attitude.
p196
aVAre you bothered by language fads and language change,
p197
aVor do you find it fun, interesting,
p198
aVsomething worthy of study
p199
aVas part of a living language?
p200
aa(lp201
VThe list by Lake Superior State University
p202
aVcontinues a fairly long tradition in English
p203
aVof complaints about new words.
p204
aVSo here is Dean Henry Alford in 1875,
p205
aVwho was very concerned that "desirability"
p206
aVis really a terrible word.
p207
aVIn 1760, Benjamin Franklin
p208
aVwrote a letter to David Hume
p209
aVgiving up the word "colonize" as bad.
p210
aa(lp211
VOver the years, we've also seen worries
p212
aVabout new pronunciations.
p213
aVHere is Samuel Rogers in 1855
p214
aVwho is concerned about some fashionable pronunciations
p215
aVthat he finds offensive,
p216
aVand he says "as if contemplate were not bad enough,
p217
aVbalcony makes me sick."
p218
aV(Laughter)
p219
aVThe word is borrowed in from Italian
p220
aVand it was pronounced bal-COE-nee.
p221
aa(lp222
VThese complaints now strike us as quaint,
p223
aVif not downright adorkable \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p224
aVbut here's the thing:
p225
aVwe still get quite worked up about language change.
p226
aVI have an entire file in my office
p227
aVof newspaper articles
p228
aVwhich express concern about illegitimate words
p229
aVthat should not have been included in the dictionary,
p230
aVincluding "LOL"
p231
aVwhen it got into the Oxford English Dictionary
p232
aVand "defriend"
p233
aVwhen it got into the Oxford American Dictionary.
p234
aVI also have articles expressing concern
p235
aVabout "invite" as a noun,
p236
aV"impact" as a verb,
p237
aVbecause only teeth can be impacted,
p238
aVand "incentivize" is described
p239
aVas "boorish, bureaucratic misspeak."
p240
aa(lp241
VNow, it's not that dictionary editors
p242
aVignore these kinds of attitudes about language.
p243
aVThey try to provide us some guidance about words
p244
aVthat are considered slang or informal
p245
aVor offensive, often through usage labels,
p246
aVbut they're in something of a bind,
p247
aVbecause they're trying to describe what we do,
p248
aVand they know that we often go to dictionaries
p249
aVto get information about how we should use a word
p250
aVwell or appropriately.
p251
aVIn response, the American Heritage Dictionaries
p252
aVinclude usage notes.
p253
aVUsage notes tend to occur with words
p254
aVthat are troublesome in one way,
p255
aVand one of the ways that they can be troublesome
p256
aVis that they're changing meaning.
p257
aVNow usage notes involve very human decisions,
p258
aVand I think, as dictionary users,
p259
aVwe're often not as aware of those human decisions
p260
aVas we should be.
p261
aVTo show you what I mean,
p262
aVwe'll look at an example, but before we do,
p263
aVI want to explain what the dictionary editors
p264
aVare trying to deal with in this usage note.
p265
aa(lp266
VThink about the word "peruse"
p267
aVand how you use that word.
p268
aVI would guess many of you are thinking
p269
aVof skim, scan, reading quickly.
p270
aVSome of you may even have some walking involved,
p271
aVbecause you're perusing grocery store shelves,
p272
aVor something like that.
p273
aVYou might be surprised to learn
p274
aVthat if you look in most standard dictionaries,
p275
aVthe first definition will be to read carefully,
p276
aVor pore over.
p277
aVAmerican Heritage has that as the first definition.
p278
aVThey then have, as the second definition, skim,
p279
aVand next to that, they say "usage problem."
p280
aV(Laughter)
p281
aVAnd then they include a usage note,
p282
aVwhich is worth looking at.
p283
aa(lp284
VSo here's the usage note:
p285
aV"Peruse has long meant 'to read thoroughly'...
p286
aVBut the word is often used more loosely,
p287
aVto mean simply 'to read.'...
p288
aVFurther extension of the word to mean 'to glance over, skim,'
p289
aVhas traditionally been considered an error,
p290
aVbut our ballot results suggest that it is becoming
p291
aVsomewhat more acceptable.
p292
aVWhen asked about the sentence,
p293
aV'I only had a moment to peruse the manual quickly,'
p294
aV66 percent of the [Usage] Panel
p295
aVfound it unacceptable in 1988,
p296
aV58 percent in 1999,
p297
aVand 48 percent in 2011."
p298
aa(lp299
VAh, the Usage Panel,
p300
aVthat trusted body of language authorities
p301
aVwho is getting more lenient about this.
p302
aVNow, what I hope you're thinking right now is,
p303
aV"Wait, who's on the Usage Panel?
p304
aVAnd what should I do with their pronouncements?"
p305
aVIf you look in the front matter
p306
aVof American Heritage Dictionaries,
p307
aVyou can actually find the names
p308
aVof the people on the Usage Panel.
p309
aVBut who looks at the front matter of dictionaries?
p310
aVThere are about 200 people on the Usage Panel.
p311
aVThey include academicians,
p312
aVjournalists, creative writers.
p313
aVThere's a Supreme Court justice on it
p314
aVand a few linguists.
p315
aVAs of 2005, the list includes me.
p316
aV(Applause)
p317
aa(lp318
VHere's what we can do for you.
p319
aVWe can give you a sense
p320
aVof the range of opinions about contested usage.
p321
aVThat is and should be the extent of our authority.
p322
aVWe are not a language academy.
p323
aVAbout once a year, I get a ballot
p324
aVthat asks me about whether new uses,
p325
aVnew pronunciations, new meanings, are acceptable.
p326
aa(lp327
VNow here's what I do to fill out the ballot.
p328
aVI listen to what other people are saying and writing.
p329
aVI do not listen to my own likes
p330
aVand dislikes about the English language.
p331
aVI will be honest with you:
p332
aVI do not like the word "impactful,"
p333
aVbut that is neither here nor there
p334
aVin terms of whether "impactful" is becoming common usage
p335
aVand becoming more acceptable in written prose.
p336
aVSo to be responsible,
p337
aVwhat I do is go look at usage,
p338
aVwhich often involves going to look
p339
aVat online databases such as Google Books.
p340
aVWell, if you look for "impactful" in Google Books,
p341
aVhere is what you find.
p342
aVWell, it sure looks like "impactful"
p343
aVis proving useful
p344
aVfor a certain number of writers,
p345
aVand has become more and more useful
p346
aVover the last 20 years.
p347
aa(lp348
VNow, there are going to be changes
p349
aVthat all of us don't like in the language.
p350
aVThere are going to be changes where you think,
p351
aV"Really?
p352
aVDoes the language have to change that way?"
p353
aVWhat I'm saying is,
p354
aVwe should be less quick
p355
aVto decide that that change is terrible,
p356
aVwe should be less quick to impose
p357
aVour likes and dislikes about words on other people,
p358
aVand we should be entirely reluctant
p359
aVto think that the English language is in trouble.
p360
aVIt's not. It is rich and vibrant and filled
p361
aVwith the creativity of the speakers who speak it.
p362
aVIn retrospect, we think it's fascinating
p363
aVthat the word "nice" used to mean silly,
p364
aVand that the word "decimate"
p365
aVused to mean to kill one in every 10.
p366
aV(Laughter)
p367
aVWe think that Ben Franklin was being silly
p368
aVto worry about "notice" as a verb.
p369
aVWell, you know what?
p370
aVWe're going to look pretty silly in a hundred years
p371
aVfor worrying about "impact" as a verb
p372
aVand "invite" as a noun.
p373
aVThe language is not going to change so fast
p374
aVthat we can't keep up.
p375
aVLanguage just doesn't work that way.
p376
aVI hope that what you can do
p377
aVis find language change not worrisome
p378
aVbut fun and fascinating,
p379
aVjust the way dictionary editors do.
p380
aVI hope you can enjoy being part
p381
aVof the creativity that is continually remaking
p382
aVour language and keeping it robust.
p383
aa(lp384
VSo how does a word get into a dictionary?
p385
aVIt gets in because we use it
p386
aVand we keep using it,
p387
aVand dictionary editors are paying attention to us.
p388
aVIf you're thinking, "But that lets all of us decide
p389
aVwhat words mean,"
p390
aVI would say, "Yes it does,
p391
aVand it always has."
p392
aVDictionaries are a wonderful guide and resource,
p393
aVbut there is no objective dictionary authority out there
p394
aVthat is the final arbiter about what words mean.
p395
aVIf a community of speakers is using a word
p396
aVand knows what it means, it's real.
p397
aVThat word might be slangy,
p398
aVthat word might be informal,
p399
aVthat word might be a word that you think
p400
aVis illogical or unnecessary,
p401
aVbut that word that we're using,
p402
aVthat word is real.
p403
aa(lp404
VThank you.

VI'm extremely excited to be given the opportunity
p5
aVto come and speak to you today
p6
aVabout what I consider to be
p7
aVthe biggest stunt on Earth.
p8
aVOr perhaps not quite on Earth.
p9
aVA parachute jump from the very edge of space.
p10
aVMore about that a bit later on.
p11
aa(lp12
VWhat I'd like to do first is take you through
p13
aVa very brief helicopter ride of stunts
p14
aVand the stunts industry in the movies and in television,
p15
aVand show you how technology
p16
aVhas started to interface with the physical skills
p17
aVof the stunt performer
p18
aVin a way that makes the stunts bigger
p19
aVand actually makes them safer than they've ever been before.
p20
aa(lp21
VI've been a professional stunt man for 13 years.
p22
aVI'm a stunt coordinator. And as well as perform stunts
p23
aVI often design them.
p24
aVDuring that time, health and safety has become everything about my job.
p25
aVIt's critical now that when a car crash happens
p26
aVit isn't just the stunt person we make safe, it's the crew.
p27
aVWe can't be killing camera men. We can't be killing stunt men.
p28
aVWe can't be killing anybody or hurting anybody on set,
p29
aVor any passerby. So, safety is everything.
p30
aVBut it wasn't always that way.
p31
aa(lp32
VIn the old days of the silent movies \u2014
p33
aVHarold Lloyd here, hanging famously from the clock hands \u2014
p34
aVa lot of these guys did their own stunts. They were quite remarkable.
p35
aVThey had no safety, no real technology.
p36
aVWhat safety they had was very scant.
p37
aVThis is the first stunt woman,
p38
aVRosie Venger, an amazing woman.
p39
aVYou can see from the slide, very very strong.
p40
aVShe really paved the way
p41
aVat a time when nobody was doing stunts, let alone women.
p42
aa(lp43
VMy favorite and a real hero of mine is Yakima Canutt.
p44
aVYakima Canutt really formed the stunt fight.
p45
aVHe worked with John Wayne and most of those old punch-ups you see
p46
aVin the Westerns. Yakima was either there or he stunt coordinated.
p47
aVThis is a screen capture from "Stagecoach,"
p48
aVwhere Yakima Canutt is doing one of the most dangerous stunts I've ever seen.
p49
aVThere is no safety, no back support,
p50
aVno pads, no crash mats, no sand pits in the ground.
p51
aVThat's one of the most dangerous horse stunts, certainly.
p52
aa(lp53
VTalking of dangerous stunts and bringing things slightly up to date,
p54
aVsome of the most dangerous stunts we do as stunt people are fire stunts.
p55
aVWe couldn't do them without technology.
p56
aVThese are particularly dangerous
p57
aVbecause there is no mask on my face.
p58
aVThey were done for a photo shoot. One for the Sun newspaper,
p59
aVone for FHM magazine.
p60
aVHighly dangerous, but also you'll notice
p61
aVit doesn't look as though I'm wearing anything underneath the suit.
p62
aVThe fire suits of old, the bulky suits, the thick woolen suits,
p63
aVhave been replaced with modern materials
p64
aVlike Nomex or, more recently, Carbonex \u2014
p65
aVfantastic materials that enable us as stunt professionals
p66
aVto burn for longer, look more spectacular, and in pure safety.
p67
aVHere's a bit more.
p68
aVThere's a guy with a flame thrower there, giving me what for.
p69
aa(lp70
VOne of the things that a stuntman often does,
p71
aVand you'll see it every time in the big movies,
p72
aVis be blown through the air.
p73
aVWell, we used to use trampettes. In the old days, that's all they had.
p74
aVAnd that's a ramp. Spring off the thing and fly through the air,
p75
aVand hopefully you make it look good.
p76
aa(lp77
VNow we've got technology. This thing is called an air ram.
p78
aVIt's a frightening piece of equipment for the novice stunt performer,
p79
aVbecause it will break your legs very, very quickly
p80
aVif you land on it wrong.
p81
aVHaving said that, it works with compressed nitrogen.
p82
aVAnd that's in the up position. When you step on it,
p83
aVeither by remote control or with the pressure of your foot,
p84
aVit will fire you, depending on the gas pressure,
p85
aVanything from five feet to 30 feet.
p86
aVI could, quite literally, fire myself into the gallery.
p87
aVWhich I'm sure you wouldn't want.
p88
aVNot today.
p89
aa(lp90
VCar stunts are another area
p91
aVwhere technology and engineering
p92
aVadvances have made life easier for us, and safer.
p93
aVWe can do bigger car stunts than ever before now.
p94
aVBeing run over is never easy.
p95
aVThat's an old-fashioned, hard, gritty, physical stunt.
p96
aVBut we have padding, and fantastic shock-absorbing things like Sorbothane \u2014
p97
aVthe materials that help us, when we're hit like this,
p98
aVnot to hurt ourselves too much.
p99
aa(lp100
VThe picture in the bottom right-hand corner there
p101
aVis of some crash test dummy work that I was doing.
p102
aVShowing how stunts work in different areas, really.
p103
aVAnd testing breakaway signpost pillars.
p104
aVA company makes a Lattix pillar, which is a network,
p105
aVa lattice-type pillar that collapses when it's hit.
p106
aVThe car on the left drove into the steel pillar.
p107
aVAnd you can't see it from there, but the engine was in the driver's lap.
p108
aVThey did it by remote control.
p109
aVI drove the other one at 60 miles an hour, exactly the same speed,
p110
aVand clearly walked away from it.
p111
aa(lp112
VRolling a car over is another area where we use technology.
p113
aVWe used to have to drive up a ramp, and we still do sometimes.
p114
aVBut now we have a compressed nitrogen cannon.
p115
aVYou can just see, underneath the car, there is a black rod on the floor
p116
aVby the wheel of the other car.
p117
aVThat's the piston that was fired out of the floor.
p118
aVWe can flip lorries, coaches, buses, anything over
p119
aVwith a nitrogen cannon with enough power. (Laughs)
p120
aa(lp121
VIt's a great job, really. (Laughter)
p122
aVIt's such fun!
p123
aVYou should hear
p124
aVsome of the phone conversations that I have with people
p125
aVon my Bluetooth in the shop.
p126
aV"Well, we can flip the bus over, we can have it burst into flames,
p127
aVand how about someone, you know, big explosion."
p128
aVAnd people are looking like this ...
p129
aV(Laughs)
p130
aVI sort of forget how bizarre some of those conversations are.
p131
aa(lp132
VThe next thing that I'd like to show you is something that
p133
aVDunlop asked me to do earlier this year
p134
aVwith our Channel Five's "Fifth Gear Show."
p135
aVA loop-the-loop, biggest in the world.
p136
aVOnly one person had ever done it before.
p137
aVNow, the stuntman solution to this in the old days would be,
p138
aV"Let's hit this as fast as possible. 60 miles an hour.
p139
aVLet's just go for it. Foot flat to the floor."
p140
aVWell, you'd die if you did that.
p141
aa(lp142
VWe went to Cambridge University, the other university,
p143
aVand spoke to a Doctor of Mechanical Engineering there,
p144
aVa physicist who taught us that it had to be 37 miles an hour.
p145
aVEven then, I caught seven G
p146
aVand lost a bit of consciousness on the way in.
p147
aVThat's a long way to fall, if you get it wrong. That was just about right.
p148
aVSo again, science helps us, and with the engineering too \u2014
p149
aVthe modifications to the car and the wheel.
p150
aa(lp151
VHigh falls, they're old fashioned stunts.
p152
aVWhat's interesting about high falls
p153
aVis that although we use airbags,
p154
aVand some airbags are quite advanced,
p155
aVthey're designed so you don't slip off the side like you used to,
p156
aVif you land a bit wrong. So, they're a much safer proposition.
p157
aVJust basically though, it is a basic piece of equipment.
p158
aVIt's a bouncy castle
p159
aVwith slats in the side to allow the air to escape.
p160
aVThat's all it is, a bouncy castle.
p161
aVThat's the only reason we do it. See, it's all fun, this job.
p162
aVWhat's interesting is we still use cardboard boxes.
p163
aVThey used to use cardboard boxes years ago and we still use them.
p164
aVAnd that's interesting because they are almost retrospective.
p165
aVThey're great for catching you, up to certain heights.
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd on the other side of the fence,
p168
aVthat physical art, the physical performance of the stuntman,
p169
aVhas interfaced with the very highest
p170
aVtechnology in I.T. and in software.
p171
aVNot the cardboard box, but the green screen.
p172
aVThis is a shot of "Terminator," the movie.
p173
aVTwo stunt guys doing what I consider to be a rather benign stunt.
p174
aVIt's 30 feet. It's water. It's very simple.
p175
aVWith the green screen we can put any background in the world on it,
p176
aVmoving or still,
p177
aVand I can assure you, nowadays you can't see the joint.
p178
aVThis is a parachutist with another parachutist doing exactly the same thing.
p179
aVCompletely in the safety of a studio,
p180
aVand yet with the green screen we can have some moving image that a skydiver took,
p181
aVand put in the sky moving and the clouds whizzing by.
p182
aa(lp183
VDecelerator rigs and wires, we use them a lot.
p184
aVWe fly people on wires, like this.
p185
aVThis guy is not skydiving. He's being flown like a kite,
p186
aVor moved around like a kite.
p187
aa(lp188
VAnd this is a Guinness World Record attempt.
p189
aVThey asked me to open their 50th anniversary show in 2004.
p190
aVAnd again, technology meant that I could do the fastest abseil over 100 meters,
p191
aVand stop within a couple of feet of the ground
p192
aVwithout melting the rope with the friction,
p193
aVbecause of the alloys I used in the descender device.
p194
aVAnd that's Centre Point in London.
p195
aVWe brought Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road to a standstill.
p196
aa(lp197
VHelicopter stunts are always fun,
p198
aVhanging out of them, whatever.
p199
aVAnd aerial stunts. No aerial stunt would be the same without skydiving.
p200
aVWhich brings us quite nicely to why I'm really here today:
p201
aVProject Space Jump.
p202
aa(lp203
VIn 1960, Joseph Kittenger of the United States Air Force
p204
aVdid the most spectacular thing.
p205
aVHe did a jump from 100,000 feet, 102,000 to be precise,
p206
aVand he did it to test high altitude systems
p207
aVfor military pilots
p208
aVin the new range of aircraft that were going up to 80,000 feet or so.
p209
aVAnd I'd just like to show you a little footage
p210
aVof what he did back then.
p211
aVAnd just how brave he was in 1960, bear in mind.
p212
aa(lp213
VProject Excelsior, it was called.
p214
aVThere were three jumps.
p215
aVThey first dropped some dummies.
p216
aVSo that's the balloon, big gas balloon.
p217
aVIt's that shape because the helium has to expand.
p218
aVMy balloon will expand to 500 times
p219
aVand look like a big pumpkin when it's at the top.
p220
aVThese are the dummies being dropped from 100,000 feet,
p221
aVand there is the camera that's strapped to them.
p222
aVYou can clearly see the curvature of the Earth at that kind of altitude.
p223
aVAnd I'm planning to go from 120,000 feet,
p224
aVwhich is about 22 miles.
p225
aVYou're in a near vacuum in that environment,
p226
aVwhich is in minus 50 degrees.
p227
aVSo it's an extremely hostile place to be.
p228
aa(lp229
VThis is Joe Kittenger himself.
p230
aVBear in mind, ladies and gents, this was 1960.
p231
aVHe didn't know if he would live or die. This is an extremely brave man.
p232
aVI spoke with him on the phone a few months ago.
p233
aVHe's a very humble and wonderful human being.
p234
aVHe sent me an email, saying, "If you get this thing off the ground
p235
aVI wish you all the best." And he signed it, "Happy landings,"
p236
aVwhich I thought was quite lovely.
p237
aVHe's in his 80s and he lives in Florida. He's a tremendous guy.
p238
aVThis is him in a pressure suit.
p239
aa(lp240
VNow one of the challenges of going up to altitude is
p241
aVwhen you get to 30,000 feet \u2014 it's great, isn't it? \u2014
p242
aVWhen you get to 30,000 feet you can really only use oxygen.
p243
aVAbove 30,000 feet up to nearly 50,000 feet,
p244
aVyou need pressure breathing, which is where you're wearing a G suit.
p245
aVThis is him in his old rock-and-roll jeans there,
p246
aVpushing him in, those turned up jeans.
p247
aVYou need a pressure suit.
p248
aVYou need a pressure breathing system
p249
aVwith a G suit that squeezes you, that helps you to breathe in
p250
aVand helps you to exhale.
p251
aa(lp252
VAbove 50,000 feet you need a space suit, a pressure suit.
p253
aVCertainly at 100,000 feet no aircraft will fly.
p254
aVNot even a jet engine.
p255
aVIt needs to be rocket-powered or one of these things,
p256
aVa great big gas balloon.
p257
aVIt took me a while; it took me years to find the right balloon team
p258
aVto build the balloon that would do this job.
p259
aVI've found that team in America now.
p260
aVAnd it's made of polyethylene, so it's very thin.
p261
aVWe will have two balloons for each of my test jumps,
p262
aVand two balloons for the main jump, because they
p263
aVnotoriously tear on takeoff.
p264
aVThey're just so, so delicate.
p265
aa(lp266
VThis is the step off. He's written on that thing,
p267
aV"The highest step in the world."
p268
aVAnd what must that feel like?
p269
aVI'm excited and I'm scared,
p270
aVboth at the same time in equal measures.
p271
aVAnd this is the camera that he had on him as he tumbled
p272
aVbefore his drogue chute opened to stabilize him.
p273
aVA drogue chute is just a smaller chute which helps to keep your face down.
p274
aVYou can just see them there, popping open.
p275
aVThose are the drogue chutes. He had three of them.
p276
aVI did quite a lot of research.
p277
aVAnd you'll see in a second there, he comes back down to the floor.
p278
aa(lp279
VNow just to give you some perspective of this balloon,
p280
aVthe little black dots are people.
p281
aVIt's hundreds of feet high. It's enormous.
p282
aVThat's in New Mexico.
p283
aVThat's the U.S. Air Force Museum.
p284
aVAnd they've made a dummy of him. That's exactly what it looked like.
p285
aVMy gondola will be more simple than that.
p286
aVIt's a three sided box, basically.
p287
aa(lp288
VSo I've had to do quite a lot of training.
p289
aVThis is Morocco last year in the Atlas mountains,
p290
aVtraining in preparation for some high altitude jumps.
p291
aVThis is what the view is going to be like
p292
aVat 90,000 feet for me.
p293
aVNow you may think this is just
p294
aVa thrill-seeking trip, a pleasure ride,
p295
aVjust the world's biggest stunt.
p296
aVWell there's a little bit more to it than that.
p297
aa(lp298
VTrying to find a space suit to do this
p299
aVhas led me to an area of technology
p300
aVthat I never really expected when I set about doing this.
p301
aVI contacted a company in the States
p302
aVwho make suits for NASA.
p303
aVThat's a current suit. This was me last year with their chief engineer.
p304
aVThat suit would cost me about a million and a half dollars.
p305
aVAnd it weighs 300 pounds and you can't skydive in it.
p306
aVSo I've been stuck. For the past 15 years I've been trying to find a space suit
p307
aVthat would do this job, or someone that will make one.
p308
aa(lp309
VSomething revolutionary happened
p310
aVa little while ago, at the same facility.
p311
aVThat's the prototype of the parachute. I've now had them custom make one,
p312
aVthe only one of its kind in the world. And that's the only suit of its kind in the world.
p313
aVIt was made by a Russian that's designed
p314
aVmost of the suits of the past
p315
aV18 years for the Soviets.
p316
aVHe left the company because he saw,
p317
aVas some other people in the space suit industry,
p318
aVan emerging market for space suits for space tourists.
p319
aa(lp320
VYou know if you are in an aircraft at 30,000 feet
p321
aVand the cabin depressurizes, you can have oxygen.
p322
aVIf you're at 100,000 feet you die.
p323
aVIn six seconds you've lost consciousness. In 10 seconds you're dead.
p324
aVYour blood tries to boil. It's called vaporization.
p325
aVThe body swells up. It's awful.
p326
aVAnd so we expect \u2014 it's not much fun.
p327
aVWe expect, and others expect,
p328
aVthat perhaps the FAA, the CAA
p329
aVmight say, "You need to put someone in a suit
p330
aVthat's not inflated, that's connected to the aircraft."
p331
aVThen they're comfortable, they have good vision, like this great big visor.
p332
aVAnd then if the cabin depressurizes
p333
aVwhile the aircraft is coming back down,
p334
aVin whatever emergency measures, everyone is okay.
p335
aa(lp336
VI would like to bring Costa on, if he's here,
p337
aVto show you the only one of its kind in the world.
p338
aVI was going to wear it,
p339
aVbut I thought I'd get Costa to do it, my lovely assistant.
p340
aVThank you. He's very hot. Thank you, Costa.
p341
aVThis is the communication headset you'll see
p342
aVon lots of space suits.
p343
aVIt's a two-layer suit. NASA suits have got 13 layers.
p344
aVThis is a very lightweight suit. It weighs about 15 pounds.
p345
aVIt's next to nothing. Especially designed for me.
p346
aa(lp347
VIt's a working prototype. I will use it for all the jumps.
p348
aVWould you just give us a little twirl, please, Costa?
p349
aVThank you very much.
p350
aVAnd it doesn't look far different when it's inflated,
p351
aVas you can see from the picture down there.
p352
aa(lp353
VI've even skydived in it in a wind tunnel,
p354
aVwhich means that I can practice everything I need to practice, in safety,
p355
aVbefore I ever jump out of anything. Thanks very much, Costa.
p356
aV(Applause)
p357
aa(lp358
VLadies and gentlemen, that's just about it from me.
p359
aVThe status of my mission at the moment
p360
aVis it still needs a major sponsor.
p361
aVI'm confident that we'll find one.
p362
aVI think it's a great challenge.
p363
aVAnd I hope that you will agree with me,
p364
aVit is the greatest stunt on Earth.
p365
aVThank you very much for your time.
p366
aV(Applause)

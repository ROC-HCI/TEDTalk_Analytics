VI have spent the last years
p5
aVtrying to resolve two enigmas:
p6
aVWhy is productivity so disappointing
p7
aVin all the companies where I work?
p8
aVI have worked with more than 500 companies.
p9
aVDespite all the technological advances \u2014
p10
aVcomputers, I.T., communications, telecommunications,
p11
aVthe Internet.
p12
aVEnigma number two:
p13
aVWhy is there so little engagement at work?
p14
aVWhy do people feel so miserable,
p15
aVeven actively disengaged?
p16
aVDisengaging their colleagues.
p17
aVActing against the interest of their company.
p18
aVDespite all the affiliation events,
p19
aVthe celebration, the people initiatives,
p20
aVthe leadership development programs to train
p21
aVmanagers on how to better motivate their teams.
p22
aa(lp23
VAt the beginning, I thought there was
p24
aVa chicken and egg issue:
p25
aVBecause people are less engaged,  they are less productive.
p26
aVOr vice versa, because they are less productive,
p27
aVwe put more pressure and they are less engaged.
p28
aVBut as we were doing our analysis
p29
aVwe realized that there was a common root cause
p30
aVto these two issues
p31
aVthat relates, in fact, to the basic  pillars of management.
p32
aVThe way we organize is based on two pillars.
p33
aVThe hard \u2014 structure, processes, systems.
p34
aVThe soft \u2014
p35
aVfeelings, sentiments, interpersonal relationships, traits, personality.
p36
aVAnd whenever a company
p37
aVreorganizes, restructures, reengineers,
p38
aVgoes through a cultural transformation program,
p39
aVit chooses these two pillars.
p40
aVNow, we try to refine them,
p41
aVwe try to combine them.
p42
aVThe real issue is \u2014
p43
aVand this is the answer to the two enigmas \u2014
p44
aVthese pillars are obsolete.
p45
aVEverything you read in business books is based
p46
aVeither on one or the other
p47
aVor their combination.
p48
aVThey are obsolete.
p49
aVHow do they work
p50
aVwhen you try to use these approaches
p51
aVin front of the new complexity of business?
p52
aVThe hard approach, basically  is that you start from strategy,
p53
aVrequirements, structures, processes,  systems, KPIs, scorecards,
p54
aVcommittees, headquarters, hubs, clusters,
p55
aVyou name it.
p56
aVI forgot all the metrics, incentives, committees,  middle offices and interfaces.
p57
aVWhat happens basically on the left,
p58
aVyou have more complexity, the  new complexity of business.
p59
aVWe need quality, cost, reliability, speed.
p60
aVAnd every time there is a new requirement,
p61
aVwe use the same approach.
p62
aVWe create dedicated structure processed systems,
p63
aVbasically to deal with the  new complexity of business.
p64
aVThe hard approach creates just complicatedness
p65
aVin the organization.
p66
aa(lp67
VLet's take an example.
p68
aVAn automotive company, the engineering division
p69
aVis a five-dimensional matrix.
p70
aVIf you open any cell of the matrix,
p71
aVyou find another 20-dimensional matrix.
p72
aVYou have Mr. Noise, Mr. Petrol Consumption,
p73
aVMr. Anti-Collision Properties.
p74
aVFor any new requirement,
p75
aVyou have a dedicated function
p76
aVin charge of aligning engineers against
p77
aVthe new requirement.
p78
aVWhat happens when the new  requirement emerges?
p79
aVSome years ago, a new requirement
p80
aVappeared on the marketplace:
p81
aVthe length of the warranty period.
p82
aVSo therefore the new requirement is repairability,
p83
aVmaking cars easy to repair.
p84
aVOtherwise when you bring the car  to the garage to fix the light,
p85
aVif you have to remove the engine
p86
aVto access the lights,
p87
aVthe car will have to stay one week in the garage
p88
aVinstead of two hours, and the  warranty budget will explode.
p89
aVSo, what was the solution using the hard approach?
p90
aVIf repairability is the new requirement,
p91
aVthe solution is to create a new function,
p92
aVMr. Repairability.
p93
aVAnd Mr. Repairability creates  the repairability process.
p94
aVWith a repairability scorecard,  with a repairability metric
p95
aVand eventually repairability incentive.
p96
aVThat came on top of 25 other KPIs.
p97
aVWhat percentage of these people is variable compensation?
p98
aVTwenty percent at most, divided by 26 KPIs,
p99
aVrepairability makes a difference of 0.8 percent.
p100
aVWhat difference did it make in their actions,
p101
aVtheir choices to simplify? Zero.
p102
aVBut what occurs for zero impact?  Mr. Repairability, process,
p103
aVscorecard, evaluation, coordination  with the 25 other coordinators
p104
aVto have zero impact.
p105
aa(lp106
VNow, in front of the new complexity of business,
p107
aVthe only solution is not drawing boxes
p108
aVwith reporting lines.
p109
aVIt is basically the interplay.
p110
aVHow the parts work together.
p111
aVThe connections, the interactions, the synapses.
p112
aVIt is not the skeleton of boxes,  it is the nervous system
p113
aVof adaptiveness and intelligence.
p114
aVYou know, you could call it cooperation, basically.
p115
aVWhenever people cooperate,
p116
aVthey use less resources. In everything.
p117
aVYou know, the repairability issue
p118
aVis a cooperation problem.
p119
aVWhen you design cars, please take into account
p120
aVthe needs of those who will repair the cars
p121
aVin the after sales garages.
p122
aVWhen we don't cooperate we need more time,
p123
aVmore equipment, more systems, more teams.
p124
aVWe need \u2014 When procurement, supply  chain, manufacturing don't cooperate
p125
aVwe need more stock, more inventories,  more working capital.
p126
aVWho will pay for that?
p127
aVShareholders? Customers?
p128
aVNo, they will refuse.
p129
aVSo who is left?  The employees,
p130
aVwho have to compensate through their super
p131
aVindividual efforts for the lack of cooperation.
p132
aVStress, burnout, they are  overwhelmed, accidents.
p133
aVNo wonder they disengage.
p134
aVHow do the hard and the soft try to foster cooperation?
p135
aVThe hard: In banks, when there is a problem
p136
aVbetween the back office and the front office,
p137
aVthey don't cooperate. What is the solution?
p138
aVThey create a middle office.
p139
aVWhat happens one year later?
p140
aVInstead of one problem  between the back and the front,
p141
aVnow I have two problems.
p142
aVBetween the back and the middle
p143
aVand between the middle and the front.
p144
aVPlus I have to pay for the middle office.
p145
aVThe hard approach is unable to foster cooperation.
p146
aVIt can only add new boxes,  new bones in the skeleton.
p147
aa(lp148
VThe soft approach:
p149
aVTo make people cooperate, we need  to make them like each other.
p150
aVImprove interpersonal feelings,
p151
aVthe more people like each other,  the more they will cooperate.
p152
aVIt is totally wrong.
p153
aVIt is even counterproductive.
p154
aVLook, at home I have two TVs. Why?
p155
aVPrecisely not to have to cooperate with my wife.
p156
aV(Laughter)
p157
aVNot to have to impose tradeoffs to my wife.
p158
aVAnd why I try not to impose tradeoffs to my wife
p159
aVis precisely because I love my wife.
p160
aVIf I didn't love my wife, one TV would be enough:
p161
aVYou will watch my favorite football game,
p162
aVif you are not happy, how is the book or the door?
p163
aV(Laughter)
p164
aVThe more we like each other,
p165
aVthe more we avoid the real cooperation
p166
aVthat would strain our relationships  by imposing tough tradeoffs.
p167
aVAnd we go for a second TV or we escalate
p168
aVthe decision above for arbitration.
p169
aVDefinitely, these approaches are obsolete.
p170
aa(lp171
VTo deal with complexity, to enhance the nervous system,
p172
aVwe have created what we call  the smart simplicity approach
p173
aVbased on simple rules.
p174
aVSimple rule number one:
p175
aVUnderstand what others do.
p176
aVWhat is their real work?
p177
aVWe need to go beyond the boxes,
p178
aVthe job descriptions, beyond the surface
p179
aVof the container, to understand the real content.
p180
aVMe, designer, if I put a wire here,
p181
aVI know that it will mean that we will have to
p182
aVremove the engine to access the lights.
p183
aVSecond, you need to reenforce integrators.
p184
aVIntegrators are not middle  offices, they are managers,
p185
aVexisting managers that you reinforce
p186
aVso that they have power and interest
p187
aVto make others cooperate.
p188
aVHow can you reinforce your  managers as integrators?
p189
aVBy removing layers.
p190
aVWhen there are too many layers
p191
aVpeople are too far from the action,
p192
aVtherefore they need KPIs, metrics,
p193
aVthey need poor proxies for reality.
p194
aVThey don't understand reality
p195
aVand they add the complicatedness of metrics, KPIs.
p196
aVBy removing rules \u2014 the bigger we are,
p197
aVthe more we need integrators,
p198
aVtherefore the less rules we must have,
p199
aVto give discretionary power to managers.
p200
aVAnd we do the opposite \u2014
p201
aVthe bigger we are, the more rules we create.
p202
aVAnd we end up with the Encyclopedia  Britannica of rules.
p203
aVYou need to increase the quanitity of power
p204
aVso that you can empower everybody
p205
aVto use their judgment, their intelligence.
p206
aVYou must give more cards to people
p207
aVso that they have the critical mass of cards
p208
aVto take the risk to cooperate,
p209
aVto move out of insulation.
p210
aVOtherwise, they will withdraw. They will disengage.
p211
aVThese rules, they come from game theory
p212
aVand organizational sociology.
p213
aVYou can increase the shadow of the future.
p214
aVCreate feedback loops that expose people
p215
aVto the consequences of their actions.
p216
aVThis is what the automotive company did
p217
aVwhen they saw that Mr. Repairability had no impact.
p218
aVThey said to the design engineers:
p219
aVNow, in three years, when the new  car is launched on the market,
p220
aVyou will move to the after sales  network, and become in charge
p221
aVof the warranty budget,
p222
aVand if the warranty budget explodes,
p223
aVit will explode in your face. (Laughter)
p224
aVMuch more powerful than 0.8  percent variable compensation.
p225
aVYou need also to increase reciprocity,
p226
aVby removing the buffers that make us self-sufficient.
p227
aVWhen you remove these buffers,
p228
aVyou hold me by the nose, I hold you by the ear.
p229
aVWe will cooperate.
p230
aVRemove the second TV.
p231
aVThere are many second TVs at work
p232
aVthat don't create value,
p233
aVthey just provide dysfunctional self-sufficiency.
p234
aVYou need to reward those who cooperate
p235
aVand blame those who don't cooperate.
p236
aVThe CEO of The Lego Group,
p237
aVJorgen Vig Knudstorp, has a great way to use it.
p238
aVHe says, blame is not for failure,
p239
aVit is for failing to help or ask for help.
p240
aVIt changes everything.
p241
aVSuddenly it becomes in my interest to be transparent
p242
aVon my real weaknesses, my real forecast,
p243
aVbecause I know I will not be blamed if I fail,
p244
aVbut if I fail to help or ask for help.
p245
aVWhen you do this, it has a lot of implications
p246
aVon organizational design.
p247
aVYou stop drawing boxes, dotted lines, full lines;
p248
aVyou look at their interplay.
p249
aVIt has a lot of implications on financial policies
p250
aVthat we use.
p251
aVOn human resource management practices.
p252
aVWhen you do that, you can manage complexity,
p253
aVthe new complexity of business,
p254
aVwithout getting complicated.
p255
aVYou create more value with lower cost.
p256
aVYou simultaneously improve  performance and satisfaction at work
p257
aVbecause you have removed the common root cause
p258
aVthat hinders both.
p259
aVComplicatedness: This is your  battle, business leaders.
p260
aVThe real battle is not against competitors.
p261
aVThis is rubbish, very abstract.
p262
aVWhen do we meet competitors to fight them?
p263
aVThe real battle is against ourselves,
p264
aVagainst our bureaucracy, our complicatedness.
p265
aVOnly you can fight, can do it.
p266
aVThank you.
p267
aV(Applause)

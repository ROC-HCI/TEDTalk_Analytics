VCompassion:
p5
aVwhat does it look like?
p6
aVCome with me to 915 South Bloodworth Street
p7
aVin Raleigh, North Carolina, where I grew up.
p8
aVIf you come in you will see us: evening time,
p9
aVat table \u2014 set for ten but not always all seats filled \u2014
p10
aVat the point when dinner is ready to be served.
p11
aVSince mom had eight kids,
p12
aVsometimes she said she couldn't tell who was who and where they were.
p13
aVBefore we could eat, she would ask,
p14
aV"Are all the children in?"
p15
aVAnd if someone happened to be missing,
p16
aVwe would have to, we say, "Fix a plate" for that person, put it in the oven,
p17
aVthen we could say grace, and we could eat.
p18
aa(lp19
VAlso, while we were at the table,
p20
aVthere was a ritual in our family:
p21
aVwhen something significant had happened for any one of us \u2014
p22
aVwhether mom had just been elected as the president of the PTA,
p23
aVor whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination,
p24
aVor whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent \u2014
p25
aVthe ritual at the family was, once the announcement is made,
p26
aVwe must take five, ten minutes to do what we call "make over" that person \u2014
p27
aVthat is, to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way.
p28
aVFor when one is honored, all are honored.
p29
aa(lp30
VAlso, we had to make a report on our extended "visited" members,
p31
aVthat is, extended members of the family,
p32
aVsick and elderly, shut in.
p33
aVMy task was, at least once a week, to visit Mother Lassiter
p34
aVwho lived on East Street,
p35
aVMother Williamson who lived on Bledsoe Avenue,
p36
aVand Mother Lathers who lived on Oberlin Road.
p37
aVWhy? Because they were old and infirm,
p38
aVand we needed to go by to see if they needed anything.
p39
aVFor mom said, "To be family, is to care and share and to look out for one another.
p40
aVThey are our family."
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd, of course, sometimes there was a bonus for going.
p43
aVThey would offer sweets or money.
p44
aVMom says, "If they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them,
p45
aVyou must always say, 'Nothing.'
p46
aVAnd if they insist, say, 'Whatever you mind to give me.'"
p47
aVThis was the nature of being at that table.
p48
aVIn fact, she indicated that if we would do that,
p49
aVnot only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude
p50
aVfrom the members of the extended family,
p51
aVbut she said, "Even God will smile, and when God smiles,
p52
aVthere is peace, and justice, and joy."
p53
aa(lp54
VSo, at the table at 915, I learned something about compassion.
p55
aVOf course, it was a minister's family,
p56
aVso we had to add God into it.
p57
aVAnd so, I came to think that mama eternal, mama eternal,
p58
aVis always wondering: Are all the children in?
p59
aVAnd if we had been faithful in caring and sharing,
p60
aVwe had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world.
p61
aa(lp62
VNow, it was not always wonderful at that table.
p63
aVLet me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion.
p64
aVIt was Christmas, and at our family, oh, what a morning.
p65
aVChristmas morning, where we open up our gifts,
p66
aVwhere we have special prayers, and where we get to the old upright piano
p67
aVand we would sing carols. It was a very intimate moment.
p68
aVIn fact, you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing,
p69
aVand then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed,
p70
aVexcept that daddy messed it up.
p71
aa(lp72
VThere was a member of his staff who did not have any place
p73
aVon that particular Christmas to celebrate.
p74
aVAnd daddy brought Elder Revels to the Christmas family celebration.
p75
aVWe thought he must be out of his mind.
p76
aVThis is our time. This is intimate time.
p77
aVThis is when we can just be who we are,
p78
aVand now we have this stuffy brother
p79
aVwith his shirt and tie on, while we are still in our PJs.
p80
aVWhy would daddy bring Elder Revels?
p81
aVAny other time, but not to the Christmas celebration.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd mom overheard us and said,
p84
aV"Well, you know what? If you really understand the nature of this celebration,
p85
aVit is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love.
p86
aVThat's what the celebration is all about.
p87
aVIt's time to make space, to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community."
p88
aVSo, we sucked up.
p89
aV(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VBut growing up at 915, compassion was not a word to be debated;
p92
aVit was a sensibility to how we are together.
p93
aVWe are sisters and brothers united together.
p94
aVAnd, like Chief Seattle said, "We did not spin the web of life.
p95
aVWe're all strands in it.
p96
aVAnd whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves."
p97
aVNow that's compassion.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo, let me tell you, I kind of look at the world this way.
p100
aVI see pictures, and something says, "Now, that's compassion."
p101
aVA harvested field of grain, with some grain in the corners,
p102
aVreminding me of the Hebrew tradition
p103
aVthat you may indeed harvest,
p104
aVbut you must always leave some on the edges,
p105
aVjust in case there's someone who has not
p106
aVhad the share necessary for good nurture.
p107
aVTalk about a picture of compassion.
p108
aa(lp109
VI see \u2014 always, it stirs my heart \u2014
p110
aVa picture of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
p111
aVwalking arm in arm with Andy Young and Rabbi Heschel
p112
aVand maybe Thich Nhat Hanh and some of the other saints assembled,
p113
aVwalking across the bridge and going into Selma.
p114
aVJust a photograph.
p115
aVArm in arm for struggle.
p116
aVSuffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters
p117
aVwithout the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity
p118
aVrobbing us of a sense of unity of being.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo, there's another picture. Here, this one. I really do like this picture.
p121
aVWhen Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated,
p122
aVthat day, everybody in my community was upset.
p123
aVYou heard about riots all across the land.
p124
aVBobby Kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in Indianapolis.
p125
aVThis is the picture. They said,
p126
aV"It's going to be too volatile for you to go."
p127
aVHe insisted, "I must go."
p128
aa(lp129
VSo, sitting on a flatbed truck,
p130
aVthe elders of the community are there,
p131
aVand Bobby stands up and says to the people,
p132
aV"I have bad news for you.
p133
aVSome of you may not have heard that Dr. King has been assassinated.
p134
aVI know that you are angry,
p135
aVand I know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity
p136
aVto enter now into activities of revenge. But,"
p137
aVhe said, "what I really want you to know is that I know how you feel.
p138
aVBecause I had someone dear to me snatched away.
p139
aVI know how you feel."
p140
aVAnd he said, "I hope that you will have the strength to do what I did.
p141
aVI allowed my anger, my bitterness, my grief to simmer a while,
p142
aVand then I made up my mind that I was going to make a different world,
p143
aVand we can do that together."
p144
aVThat's a picture. Compassion? I think I see it.
p145
aa(lp146
VI saw it when the Dalai Lama came to the Riverside Church while I was a pastor,
p147
aVand he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world.
p148
aVHe asked them to give a message,
p149
aVand they each read in their own language a central affirmation,
p150
aVand that was some version of the golden rule:
p151
aV"As you would that others would do unto you,
p152
aVdo also unto them."
p153
aVTwelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire
p154
aVaffirming one message.
p155
aVWe are so connected that we must treat each other
p156
aVas if an action toward you is an action toward myself.
p157
aa(lp158
VOne more picture while I'm stinking and thinking about the Riverside Church:
p159
aV9/11. Last night at Chagrin Fall,
p160
aVa newspaperman and a television guy said,
p161
aV"That evening, when a service was held at the Riverside Church,
p162
aVwe carried it on our station in this city.
p163
aVIt was," he said, "one of the most powerful moments of life together.
p164
aVWe were all suffering.
p165
aVBut you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come,
p166
aVand you invited them.
p167
aV'Find out what it is in your tradition
p168
aVthat tells us what to do when we have been humiliated,
p169
aVwhen we have been despised and rejected.'
p170
aVAnd they all spoke out of their own traditions,
p171
aVa word about the healing power of solidarity, one with the other."
p172
aa(lp173
VI developed a sense of compassion sort of as second nature,
p174
aVbut I became a preacher.
p175
aVNow, as a preacher, I got a job. I got to preach the stuff,
p176
aVbut I got to do it too.
p177
aVOr, as Father Divine in Harlem used to say to folks,
p178
aV"Some people preach the Gospel.
p179
aVI have to tangibilitate the Gospel."
p180
aVSo, the real issue is: How do you tangibilitate compassion?
p181
aVHow do you make it real?
p182
aa(lp183
VMy faith has constantly lifted up the ideal,
p184
aVand challenged me when I fell beneath it.
p185
aVIn my tradition, there is a gift that we have made to other traditions \u2014
p186
aVto everybody around the world who knows the story of the "Good Samaritan."
p187
aVMany people think of it primarily in terms of charity,
p188
aVrandom acts of kindness.
p189
aVBut for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly,
p190
aVyou will discover that a question has been raised
p191
aVthat leads to this parable.
p192
aa(lp193
VThe question was: "What is the greatest commandment?"
p194
aVAnd, according to Jesus, the word comes forth,
p195
aV"You must love yourself,
p196
aVyou must love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind and soul,
p197
aVand your neighbor as yourself."
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd then the person asked, "Well, what do you mean, 'neighbor?'"
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd he answered it by telling the story of the man who fell among thieves,
p202
aVand how religious authorities went the other way,
p203
aVand how their supporters in the congregation went the other way;
p204
aVbut an unsuspecting, despised person came along,
p205
aVsaw the man in need,
p206
aVprovided oil and wine for his wounds,
p207
aVput him on his own transportation,
p208
aVand took him to the inn
p209
aVand asked the innkeeper, "Take care of him."
p210
aVAnd he said, "Here, this is the initial investment,
p211
aVbut if needs continue, make sure that you provide them.
p212
aVAnd whatever else is needed, I will provide it and pay for it when I return."
p213
aa(lp214
VThis always seemed to me to be a deepening
p215
aVof the sense of what it means to be a Good Samaritan.
p216
aVA Good Samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched
p217
aVin an immediate act of care and charity,
p218
aVbut one who provides a system of sustained care \u2014 I like that,
p219
aV'a system of sustained care ' \u2014 in the inn, take care.
p220
aVI think maybe it's one time when the Bible talks about a healthcare system
p221
aVand a commitment to do whatever is necessary \u2014
p222
aVthat all God's children would have their needs cared for,
p223
aVso that we could answer when mommy eternal asks, "In regards to health,
p224
aVare all the children in?" And we could say yes.
p225
aa(lp226
VOh, what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate compassion.
p227
aVI recall that my work as a pastor
p228
aVhas always involved caring for their spiritual needs;
p229
aVbeing concerned for housing, for healthcare,
p230
aVfor the prisoners, for the infirm, for children \u2014
p231
aVeven the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record
p232
aVwhere they started off, where they are going.
p233
aVTo be a pastor is to care for these individual needs.
p234
aa(lp235
VBut now, to be a Good Samaritan \u2014 and I always say,
p236
aVand to be a good American \u2014 for me,
p237
aVis not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care.
p238
aVCompassion takes on a corporate dynamic.
p239
aVI believe that whatever we did around that table at Bloodworth Street
p240
aVmust be done around tables and rituals of faith
p241
aVuntil we become that family, that family together
p242
aVthat understands the nature of our unity.
p243
aVWe are one people together.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo, let me explain to you what I mean when I think about compassion,
p246
aVand why I think it is so important that right at this point in history.
p247
aVWe would decide to establish this charter of compassion.
p248
aVThe reason it's important is because this is a very special time in history.
p249
aVIt is the time that, biblically, we would speak of as
p250
aVthe day, or the year, of God's favor.
p251
aVThis is a season of grace.
p252
aVUnusual things are beginning to happen.
p253
aVPlease pardon me, as a black man, for celebrating
p254
aVthat the election of Obama was an unusual sign
p255
aVof the fact that it is a year of favor.
p256
aVAnd yet, there is so much more that needs to be done.
p257
aVWe need to bring health and food and education
p258
aVand respect for all God's citizens, all God's children,
p259
aVremembering mama eternal.
p260
aa(lp261
VNow, let me close my comments by telling you
p262
aVthat whenever I feel something very deeply,
p263
aVit usually takes the form of verse.
p264
aVAnd so I want to close with a little song.
p265
aVI close with this song \u2014 it's a children's song \u2014
p266
aVbecause we are all children at the table of mama eternal.
p267
aVAnd if mama eternal has taught us correctly,
p268
aVthis song will make sense, not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering,
p269
aVbut to all who sign the charter for compassion.
p270
aVAnd this is why we do it.
p271
aa(lp272
VThe song says, \u266b "I made heaven so happy today, \u266b
p273
aV\u266b Receiving God's love and giving it away \u266b
p274
aV\u266b When I looked up, heaven smiled at me \u266b
p275
aV\u266b Now, I'm so happy. Can't you see? \u266b
p276
aV\u266b I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? \u266b
p277
aV\u266b Sharing makes me happy, makes heaven happy too \u266b
p278
aV\u266b I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? \u266b
p279
aV\u266b Let me share my happy loving smile with you. \u266b
p280
aa(lp281
VThat's compassion. (Applause)

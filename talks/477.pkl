VThe "Dirty Jobs" crew and I were called
p5
aVto a little town in Colorado, called Craig.
p6
aVIt's only a couple dozen square miles.
p7
aVIt's in the Rockies.
p8
aVAnd the job in question was sheep rancher.
p9
aa(lp10
VMy role on the show, for those of you who haven't seen it \u2014 it's pretty simple.
p11
aVI'm an apprentice,
p12
aVand I work with the people who do the jobs in question.
p13
aVAnd my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up,
p14
aVand give an honest account of what it's like to be these people
p15
aVfor one day in their life.
p16
aVThe job in question: herding sheep.
p17
aVGreat.
p18
aa(lp19
VWe go to Craig and we check into a hotel,
p20
aVand I realize the next day
p21
aVthat castration is going to be an absolute part of this work.
p22
aVNormally, I never do any research at all.
p23
aVBut this is a touchy subject, and I work for the Discovery Channel,
p24
aVand we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do.
p25
aVAnd we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals.
p26
aVSo I call the Humane Society and I say,
p27
aV"Look, I'm going to be castrating some lambs. Can you tell me the deal?"
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd they're like, "Yeah, it's pretty straightforward."
p30
aVThey use a band, basically, a rubber band, like this, only a little smaller.
p31
aVThis one was actually around the playing cards
p32
aVI got yesterday \u2014
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aVBut it had a certain familiarity to it.
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd I said, "Well, what exactly is the process?"
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd they said, "The band is applied to the tail, tightly.
p40
aVAnd then another band is applied to the scrotum, tightly.
p41
aVBlood flow is slowly retarded;
p42
aVa week later the parts in question fall off.
p43
aa(lp44
V"Great \u2014 got it."
p45
aVOK, I call the SPCA to confirm this.
p46
aVThey confirm it.
p47
aVI also call PETA just for fun,
p48
aVand they don't like it, but they confirm it.
p49
aVOK, that's basically how you do it.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo the next day I go out.
p52
aVAnd I'm given a horse and we go get the lambs
p53
aVand we take them to a pen that we built,
p54
aVand we go about the business of animal husbandry.
p55
aa(lp56
VMelanie is the wife of Albert.
p57
aVAlbert is the shepherd in question.
p58
aVMelanie picks up the lamb, one hand on both legs on the right,
p59
aVlikewise on the left.
p60
aVLamb goes on the post, she opens it up.
p61
aVAlright. Great.
p62
aVAlbert goes in, I follow Albert, the crew is around.
p63
aVI always watch the process done the first time before I try it.
p64
aVBeing an apprentice, you know, you do that.
p65
aVAlbert reaches in his pocket to pull out, you know, this black rubber band,
p66
aVbut what comes out instead is a knife.
p67
aVAnd I'm like, "Hmm, that's not rubber at all," you know?
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun
p72
aVthat was just coming over the Rockies, it was very \u2014
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VIt was ... it was impressive.
p77
aa(lp78
VIn the space of about two seconds,
p79
aVAlbert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail,
p80
aVright next to the butt of the lamb,
p81
aVand very quickly, the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding.
p82
aVA second later, with a big thumb and a well-calloused forefinger,
p83
aVhe had the scrotum firmly in his grasp.
p84
aVAnd he pulled it toward him, like so,
p85
aVand he took the knife and he put it on the tip.
p86
aV"Now, you think you know what's coming, Michael,
p87
aVYou don't, OK?"
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VHe snips it, throws the tip over his shoulder,
p92
aVand then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward,
p93
aVand then his head dips down, obscuring my view.
p94
aVBut what I hear is a slurping sound,
p95
aVand a noise that sounds like Velcro being yanked off a sticky wall,
p96
aVand I am not even kidding.
p97
aa(lp98
VCan we roll the video?
p99
aVNo, I'm kidding, we don't \u2014
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VI thought it best to talk in pictures.
p104
aa(lp105
VI do something now I've never, ever done on a "Dirty Jobs" shoot, ever.
p106
aVI say, "Time out. Stop."
p107
aVYou guys know the show, we use take one; we don't do take two.
p108
aVThere's no writing, there's no scripting, there's no nonsense.
p109
aVWe don't fool around, we don't rehearse \u2014
p110
aVwe shoot what we get!
p111
aa(lp112
VI said, "Stop. This is nuts."
p113
aVI mean \u2014
p114
aa(lp115
V(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
V"This is crazy.
p118
aVWe can't do this."
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd Albert's like, "What?"
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd I'm like, "I don't know what just happened,
p123
aVbut there are testicles in this bucket,
p124
aVand that's not how we do it."
p125
aa(lp126
VHe said "Well, that's how we do it."
p127
aa(lp128
VI said, "Why would you do it this way?"
p129
aVAnd before I even let him explain,
p130
aVI said, "I want to do it the right way, with the rubber bands."
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd he says, "Like the Humane Society?"
p133
aa(lp134
VI said, "Yes, like the Humane Society.
p135
aVLet's do something that doesn't make the lamb squeal and bleed.
p136
aVWe're on in five continents, dude!
p137
aVWe're on twice a day on the Discovery \u2014 we can't do this."
p138
aa(lp139
VHe says, "OK."
p140
aVHe goes to his box and pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands.
p141
aVMelanie picks up another lamb, puts it on the post,
p142
aVband goes on the tail, band goes on the scrotum.
p143
aVLamb goes on the ground, lamb takes two steps, falls down,
p144
aVgets up, shakes a little,
p145
aVtakes another couple steps, falls down.
p146
aVI'm like, this is not a good sign for this lamb, at all.
p147
aVGets up, walks to the corner.
p148
aVIt's quivering, and it lies down and it's in obvious distress.
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd I'm looking at the lamb and I say, "Albert, how long?
p151
aVWhen does he get up?"
p152
aa(lp153
VHe's like, "A day?"
p154
aa(lp155
VI said, "A day! How long does it take them to fall off?"
p156
aa(lp157
V"A week."
p158
aa(lp159
VMeanwhile, the lamb that he had just done his little procedure on
p160
aVis, you know, he's just prancing around, bleeding stopped.
p161
aVHe's, you know, nibbling on some grass, frolicking.
p162
aVAnd I was just so blown away at how completely wrong I was,
p163
aVin that second.
p164
aVAnd I was reminded how utterly wrong I am, so much of the time.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd I was especially reminded
p169
aVof what a ridiculously short straw I had that day,
p170
aVbecause now I had to do what Albert had just done,
p171
aVand there are like 100 of these lambs in the pen.
p172
aVAnd suddenly, this whole thing's starting to feel like a German porno,
p173
aVand I'm like \u2014
p174
aa(lp175
V(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VMelanie picks up the lamb, puts it on the post, opens it up.
p178
aVAlbert hands me the knife.
p179
aVI go in, tail comes off.
p180
aVI go in, I grab the scrotum, tip comes off.
p181
aVAlbert instructs, "Push it way up there."
p182
aVI do.
p183
aV"Push it further."
p184
aVI do.
p185
aa(lp186
VThe testicles emerge. They look like thumbs, coming right at you.
p187
aVAnd he says, "Bite 'em.
p188
aVJust bite 'em off."
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd I heard him, I heard all the words \u2014
p193
aa(lp194
V(Laughter)
p195
aa(lp196
VLike, how did I get here?
p197
aVHow did \u2014 I mean \u2014
p198
aVhow did I get here?
p199
aa(lp200
VIt's just \u2014 it's one of those moments where the brain goes off on its own,
p201
aVand suddenly, I'm standing there in the Rockies,
p202
aVand all I can think of is the Aristotelian definition of a tragedy.
p203
aVYou know, Aristotle says a tragedy is that moment
p204
aVwhen the hero comes face to face with his true identity.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Laughter)
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd I'm like, "What is this jacked-up metaphor?
p209
aVI don't like what I'm thinking right now."
p210
aVAnd I can't get this thought out of my head,
p211
aVand I can't get that vision out of my sight,
p212
aVso I did what I had to do.
p213
aVI went in and I took them.
p214
aVI took them like this,
p215
aVand I yanked my head back.
p216
aVAnd I'm standing there with two testicles on my chin.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd now I can't get \u2014 I can't shake the metaphor.
p221
aa(lp222
VI'm still in "Poetics," in Aristotle, and I'm thinking \u2014
p223
aVout of nowhere, two terms come crashing into my head, that I hadn't heard
p224
aVsince my classics professor in college drilled them there.
p225
aVAnd they are "anagnorisis" and "peripeteia."
p226
aVAnagnorisis and peripeteia.
p227
aVAnagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery.
p228
aVLiterally, the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis.
p229
aVIt's what our network does; it's what "Dirty Jobs" is.
p230
aVAnd I'm up to my neck in anagnorises every single day.
p231
aVGreat.
p232
aVThe other word, peripeteia,
p233
aVthat's the moment in the great tragedies \u2014
p234
aVEuripides and Sophocles.
p235
aVThat's the moment where Oedipus has his moment, where he suddenly realizes
p236
aVthat hot chick he's been sleeping with and having babies with
p237
aVis his mother.
p238
aVThat's peripety, or peripeteia.
p239
aVAnd this metaphor in my head \u2014
p240
aVI've got anagnorisis and peripeteia on my chin \u2014
p241
aa(lp242
V(Laughter)
p243
aa(lp244
VI've got to tell you, it's such a great device, though.
p245
aVWhen you start to look for peripeteia,
p246
aVyou find it everywhere.
p247
aVI mean, Bruce Willis in "The Sixth Sense," right?
p248
aVSpends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people,
p249
aVand then \u2014 boom! \u2014 "Oh, I'm dead."
p250
aVPeripeteia. You know?
p251
aVIt's crushing when the audience sees it the right way.
p252
aVNeo in "The Matrix," you know?
p253
aV"Oh, I'm living in a computer program.
p254
aVThat's weird."
p255
aa(lp256
VThese discoveries that lead to sudden realizations.
p257
aVAnd I've been having them, over 200 dirty jobs,
p258
aVI have them all the time, but that one \u2014
p259
aVthat one drilled something home in a way that I just wasn't prepared for.
p260
aVAnd, as I stood there,
p261
aVlooking at the happy lamb that I had just defiled \u2014
p262
aVbut it looked OK;
p263
aVlooking at that poor other little thing that I'd done it the right way on,
p264
aVand I just was struck by \u2014
p265
aVif I'm wrong about that,
p266
aVand if I'm wrong so often, in a literal way,
p267
aVwhat other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon?
p268
aa(lp269
VBecause, look \u2014 I'm not a social anthropologist,
p270
aVbut I have a friend who is.
p271
aVAnd I talk to him.
p272
aa(lp273
V(Laughter)
p274
aa(lp275
VAnd he says, "Hey Mike, look.
p276
aVI don't know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not,
p277
aVbut do you realize you've shot in every state?
p278
aVYou've worked in mining, you've worked in fishing,
p279
aVyou've worked in steel, you've worked in every major industry.
p280
aVYou've had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys
p281
aVthat our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years, right?"
p282
aa(lp283
VI can still see Hillary doing the shots of rye,
p284
aVdribbling down her chin, with the steel workers.
p285
aVI mean, these are the people that I work with every single day.
p286
aV"And if you have something to say about their thoughts, collectively,
p287
aVit might be time to think about it.
p288
aVBecause, dude, you know, four years."
p289
aVSo, that's in my head, testicles are on my chin,
p290
aVthoughts are bouncing around.
p291
aVAnd, after that shoot, "Dirty Jobs" really didn't change,
p292
aVin terms of what the show is, but it changed for me, personally.
p293
aa(lp294
VAnd now, when I talk about the show,
p295
aVI no longer just tell the story you heard and 190 like it.
p296
aVI do, but I also start to talk about some of the other things
p297
aVI got wrong;
p298
aVsome of the other notions of work
p299
aVthat I've just been assuming are sacrosanct,
p300
aVand they're not.
p301
aVPeople with dirty jobs are happier than you think.
p302
aVAs a group, they're the happiest people I know.
p303
aVAnd I don't want to start whistling "Look for the Union Label,"
p304
aVand all that happy-worker crap.
p305
aVI'm just telling you that these are balanced people
p306
aVwho do unthinkable work.
p307
aVRoadkill picker-uppers whistle while they work, I swear to God \u2014
p308
aVI did it with them.
p309
aVThey've got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life.
p310
aVAnd I see it over and over and over again.
p311
aa(lp312
VSo I started to wonder what would happen
p313
aVif we challenged some of these sacred cows?
p314
aVFollow your passion \u2014
p315
aVwe've been talking about it here for the last 36 hours.
p316
aVFollow your passion \u2014 what could possibly be wrong with that?
p317
aVIt's probably the worst advice I ever got.
p318
aa(lp319
V(Laughter)
p320
aa(lp321
VFollow your dreams and go broke, right?
p322
aVI mean, that's all I heard growing up.
p323
aVI didn't know what to do with my life,
p324
aVbut I was told if you follow your passion, it's going to work out.
p325
aa(lp326
VI can give you 30 examples right now.
p327
aVBob Combs, the pig farmer in Las Vegas
p328
aVwho collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos
p329
aVand feeds them to his swine.
p330
aVWhy?
p331
aVBecause there's so much protein in the stuff we don't eat,
p332
aVhis pigs grow at twice the normal speed, and he's one rich pig farmer.
p333
aVHe's good for the environment,
p334
aVhe spends his days doing this incredible service,
p335
aVand he smells like hell, but God bless him.
p336
aVHe's making a great living.
p337
aVYou ask him, "Did you follow your passion here?"
p338
aVand he'd laugh at you.
p339
aVThe guy's worth \u2014 he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farm
p340
aVand turned it down, outside of Vegas.
p341
aVHe didn't follow his passion.
p342
aVHe stepped back and he watched where everybody was going,
p343
aVand he went the other way.
p344
aVAnd I hear that story over and over.
p345
aa(lp346
VMatt Freund, a dairy farmer in New Canaan, Connecticut,
p347
aVwho woke up one day and realized
p348
aVthe crap from his cows was worth more than their milk,
p349
aVif he could use it to make these biodegradable flowerpots.
p350
aVNow he's selling them to Walmart, right?
p351
aVFollow his passion? The guy's \u2014 come on.
p352
aa(lp353
VSo I started to look at passion,
p354
aVI started to look at efficiency vs. effectiveness.
p355
aVAs Tim talked about earlier, that's a huge distinction.
p356
aVI started to look at teamwork and determination.
p357
aVAnd basically, all those platitudes they call "successories"
p358
aVthat hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now,
p359
aVthat stuff \u2014 it's suddenly all been turned on its head.
p360
aa(lp361
VSafety. Safety first is ...
p362
aVGoing back to OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society:
p363
aVWhat if OSHA got it wrong?
p364
aVI mean \u2014 this is heresy, what I'm about to say \u2014
p365
aVbut what if it's really safety third?
p366
aVRight?
p367
aa(lp368
V(Laughter)
p369
aa(lp370
VNo, I mean, really.
p371
aVWhat I mean to say is:
p372
aVI value my safety on these crazy jobs
p373
aVas much as the people that I'm working with,
p374
aVbut the ones who really get it done \u2014
p375
aVthey're not out there talking about safety first.
p376
aVThey know that other things come first \u2014
p377
aVthe business of doing the work comes first,
p378
aVthe business of getting it done.
p379
aa(lp380
VAnd I'll never forget, up in the Bering Sea,
p381
aVI was on a crab boat with the "Deadliest Catch" guys \u2014
p382
aVwhich I also work on in the first season.
p383
aVWe were about 100 miles off the coast of Russia:
p384
aV50-foot seas, big waves, green water coming over the wheelhouse, right?
p385
aVMost hazardous environment I'd ever seen,
p386
aVand I was back with a guy, lashing the pots down.
p387
aVSo I'm 40 feet off the deck,
p388
aVwhich is like looking down at the top of your shoe, you know,
p389
aVand it's doing this in the ocean.
p390
aVUnspeakably dangerous.
p391
aa(lp392
VI scamper down, I go into the wheelhouse
p393
aVand I say, with some level of incredulity,
p394
aV"Captain \u2014 OSHA?"
p395
aa(lp396
VAnd he says, "OSHA? Ocean."
p397
aVAnd he points out there.
p398
aa(lp399
V(Laughter)
p400
aa(lp401
VBut in that moment, what he said next can't be repeated in the Lower 48.
p402
aVIt can't be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site.
p403
aVBut he looked at me and said, "Son," \u2014
p404
aVhe's my age, by the way, he calls me "son," I love that \u2014
p405
aVhe says, "Son, I'm the captain of a crab boat.
p406
aVMy responsibility is not to get you home alive.
p407
aVMy responsibility is to get you home rich."
p408
aa(lp409
V(Laughter)
p410
aa(lp411
VYou want to get home alive, that's on you."
p412
aVAnd for the rest of that day \u2014 safety first.
p413
aa(lp414
VI mean, I was like \u2014
p415
aVSo, the idea that we create this sense of complacency
p416
aVwhen all we do is talk about somebody else's responsibility
p417
aVas though it's our own, and vice versa.
p418
aVAnyhow, a whole lot of things.
p419
aVI could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made
p420
aVand the endless list of ways that I got it wrong.
p421
aVBut what it all comes down to is this:
p422
aVI've formed a theory,
p423
aVand I'm going to share it now in my remaining 2 minutes and 30 seconds.
p424
aa(lp425
VIt goes like this:
p426
aVwe've declared war on work, as a society \u2014 all of us.
p427
aVIt's a civil war.
p428
aVIt's a cold war, really.
p429
aVWe didn't set out to do it
p430
aVand we didn't twist our mustache in some Machiavellian way,
p431
aVbut we've done it.
p432
aVAnd we've waged this war on at least four fronts,
p433
aVcertainly in Hollywood.
p434
aVThe way we portray working people on TV \u2014
p435
aVit's laughable.
p436
aVIf there's a plumber, he's 300 pounds
p437
aVand he's got a giant butt crack, admit it.
p438
aVYou see him all the time.
p439
aVThat's what plumbers look like, right?
p440
aVWe turn them into heroes, or we turn them into punch lines.
p441
aVThat's what TV does.
p442
aVWe try hard on "Dirty Jobs" not to do that,
p443
aVwhich is why I do the work and I don't cheat.
p444
aa(lp445
VBut, we've waged this war on Madison Avenue.
p446
aVSo many of the commercials that come out there in the way of a message \u2014
p447
aVwhat's really being said?
p448
aV"Your life would be better if you could work a little less,
p449
aVdidn't have to work so hard, got home a little earlier,
p450
aVcould retire a little faster, punch out a little sooner."
p451
aVIt's all in there, over and over, again and again.
p452
aa(lp453
VWashington?
p454
aVI can't even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place
p455
aVthat affect the bottom-line reality of the available jobs,
p456
aVbecause I don't really know; I just know that that's a front in this war.
p457
aa(lp458
VAnd right here, guys \u2014 Silicon Valley.
p459
aVI mean \u2014 how many people have an iPhone on them right now?
p460
aVHow many people have their BlackBerry?
p461
aVWe're plugged in; we're connected.
p462
aVI would never suggest for a second
p463
aVthat something bad has come out of the tech revolution.
p464
aVGood grief, not to this crowd.
p465
aa(lp466
V(Laughter)
p467
aa(lp468
VBut I would suggest
p469
aVthat innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time.
p470
aVAnd nobody celebrates imitation
p471
aVthe way "Dirty Jobs" guys know it has to be done.
p472
aVYour iPhone without those people making the same interface,
p473
aVthe same circuitry, the same board, over and over \u2014
p474
aVall of that \u2014 that's what makes it equally as possible
p475
aVas the genius that goes inside of it.
p476
aa(lp477
VSo, we've got this new toolbox. You know?
p478
aVOur tools today don't look like shovels and picks.
p479
aVThey look like the stuff we walk around with.
p480
aVAnd so the collective effect of all of that
p481
aVhas been this marginalization of lots and lots of jobs.
p482
aVAnd I realized, probably too late in this game \u2014
p483
aVI hope not, because I don't know if I can do 200 more of these things \u2014
p484
aVbut we're going to do as many as we can.
p485
aVAnd to me, the most important thing to know
p486
aVand to really come face to face with,
p487
aVis that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things,
p488
aVnot just the testicles on my chin.
p489
aVI got a lot wrong.
p490
aa(lp491
VSo, we're thinking \u2014 by "we," I mean me \u2014
p492
aa(lp493
V(Laughter)
p494
aa(lp495
Vthat the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work \u2014
p496
aVmanual labor, skilled labor.
p497
aVSomebody needs to be out there, talking about the forgotten benefits.
p498
aVI'm talking about grandfather stuff,
p499
aVthe stuff a lot us probably grew up with
p500
aVbut we've kind of \u2014 you know, kind of lost a little.
p501
aa(lp502
VBarack wants to create two and a half million jobs.
p503
aVThe infrastructure is a huge deal.
p504
aVThis war on work that I suppose exists, has casualties like any other war.
p505
aVThe infrastructure is the first one,
p506
aVdeclining trade school enrollments are the second one.
p507
aVEvery single year, fewer electricians, fewer carpenters, fewer plumbers,
p508
aVfewer welders, fewer pipe fitters, fewer steam fitters.
p509
aVThe infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating
p510
aVare those guys \u2014 the ones that have been in decline, over and over.
p511
aVMeanwhile, we've got two trillion dollars, at a minimum,
p512
aVaccording to the American Society of Civil Engineers,
p513
aVthat we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure,
p514
aVwhich is currently rated at a D minus.
p515
aa(lp516
VSo, if I were running for anything \u2014 and I'm not \u2014
p517
aVI would simply say that the jobs we hope to make
p518
aVand the jobs we hope to create
p519
aVaren't going to stick unless they're jobs that people want.
p520
aVAnd I know the point of this conference
p521
aVis to celebrate things that are near and dear to us,
p522
aVbut I also know that clean and dirty aren't opposites.
p523
aVThey're two sides of the same coin, just like innovation and imitation,
p524
aVlike risk and responsibility, like peripeteia and anagnorisis,
p525
aVlike that poor little lamb, who I hope isn't quivering anymore,
p526
aVand like my time that's gone.
p527
aa(lp528
VIt's been great talking to you.
p529
aVAnd get back to work, will you?
p530
aa(lp531
V(Applause)

VI'm going to take you on a journey very quickly.
p5
aVTo explain the wish, I'm going to have to take you somewhere
p6
aVwhere many people haven't been, and that's around the world.
p7
aVWhen I was about 24 years old, Kate Stohr and myself started an organization
p8
aVto get architects and designers involved in humanitarian work,
p9
aVnot only about responding to natural disasters,
p10
aVbut involved in systemic issues.
p11
aVWe believe that where the resources and expertise are scarce,
p12
aVinnovative, sustainable design can really make a difference in people's lives.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo I started my life as an architect, or training as an architect,
p15
aVand I was always interested in socially responsible design,
p16
aVand how you can really make an impact.
p17
aVBut when I went to architecture school,
p18
aVit seemed that I was a black sheep in the family.
p19
aVMany architects seemed to think that when you design,
p20
aVyou design a jewel, and it's a jewel that you try and crave for;
p21
aVwhereas I felt that when you design,
p22
aVyou either improve or you create a detriment
p23
aVto the community in which you're designing.
p24
aVSo you're not just doing a building for the residents
p25
aVor for the people who are going to use it, but for the community as a whole.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd in 1999, we started by responding to the issue of the housing crisis
p28
aVfor returning refugees in Kosovo.
p29
aVAnd I didn't know what I was doing \u2014 like I said, mid-20s \u2014
p30
aVand I'm the Internet generation, so we started a website.
p31
aVWe put a call out there, and to my surprise, in a couple of months,
p32
aVwe had hundreds of entries from around the world.
p33
aVThat led to a number of prototypes being built
p34
aVand really experimenting with some ideas.
p35
aVTwo years later we started doing a project
p36
aVon developing mobile health clinics in sub-Saharan Africa,
p37
aVresponding to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
p38
aVThat led to 550 entries from 53 countries.
p39
aVWe also have designers from around the world that participate.
p40
aVAnd we had an exhibit of work that followed that.
p41
aV2004 was the tipping point for us.
p42
aVWe started responding to natural disasters
p43
aVand getting involved in Iran, in Bam,
p44
aValso following up on our work in Africa.
p45
aa(lp46
VWorking within the United States \u2014
p47
aVmost people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner.
p48
aVBut I live in Bozeman, Montana \u2014
p49
aVgo up to the north plains on the reservations,
p50
aVor go down to Alabama or Mississippi, pre-Katrina,
p51
aVand I could have shown you places that have far worse conditions
p52
aVthan many developing countries that I've been to.
p53
aVSo we got involved in and worked in inner cities and elsewhere;
p54
aa(lp55
Vand also, I will go into some more projects.
p56
aV2005: Mother Nature kicked our ass.
p57
aVI think we can pretty much assume that 2005 was a horrific year
p58
aVwhen it comes to natural disasters.
p59
aVAnd because of the Internet,
p60
aVand because of connections to blogs and so forth,
p61
aVwithin literally hours of the tsunami, we were already raising funds,
p62
aVgetting involved, working with people on the ground.
p63
aVWe run from a couple of laptops, and in the first couple of days,
p64
aVI had 4,000 emails from people needing help.
p65
aVSo we began to get involved in projects there,
p66
aVand I'll talk about some others.
p67
aVAnd then of course, this year we've been responding to Katrina,
p68
aVas well as following up on our reconstruction work.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo this is a brief overview.
p71
aVIn 2004, I really couldn't manage the number of people who wanted to help,
p72
aVor the number of requests that I was getting.
p73
aVIt was all coming into my laptop and cell phone.
p74
aVSo we decided to embrace an open-source model of business \u2014
p75
aVso that anyone, anywhere in the world, could start a local chapter,
p76
aVand they can get involved in local problems.
p77
aVBecause I believe there is no such thing as Utopia.
p78
aVAll problems are local. All solutions are local.
p79
aVSo that means, you know, somebody who's based in Mississippi
p80
aVknows more about Mississippi than I do.
p81
aVSo what happened is, we used Meetup and all these other Internet tools,
p82
aVand we ended up having 40 chapters starting up,
p83
aVthousands of architects in 104 countries.
p84
aVSo the bullet point \u2014 sorry, I never do a suit,
p85
aVso I knew that I was going to take this off.
p86
aVOK, because I'm going to do it very quick.
p87
aa(lp88
VThis isn't just about nonprofit.
p89
aVWhat it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on,
p90
aVof socially responsible designers who really believe
p91
aVthat this world has got a lot smaller, and that we have the opportunity \u2014
p92
aVnot the responsibility, but the opportunity \u2014
p93
aVto really get involved in making change.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VI'm adding that to my time.
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VSo what you don't know is,
p104
aVwe've got these thousands of designers working around the world,
p105
aVconnected basically by a website, and we have a staff of three.
p106
aVThe fact that nobody told us we couldn't do it, we did it.
p107
aVAnd so there's something to be said about naïveté.
p108
aVSo seven years later, we've developed
p109
aVso that we've got advocacy, instigation and implementation.
p110
aVWe advocate for good design, not only through student workshops
p111
aVand lectures and public forums, op-eds;
p112
aVwe have a book on humanitarian work;
p113
aVbut also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy.
p114
aVWe can talk about FEMA, but that's another talk.
p115
aVInstigation, developing ideas with communities and NGOs,
p116
aVdoing open-source design competitions.
p117
aVReferring, matchmaking with communities.
p118
aVAnd then implementing \u2014 actually going out there and doing the work,
p119
aVbecause when you invent, it's never a reality until it's built.
p120
aVSo it's really important that if we're designing
p121
aVand trying to create change, we build that change.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo here's a select number of projects.
p124
aVKosovo.
p125
aVThis is Kosovo in '99.
p126
aVWe did an open design competition, like I said.
p127
aVIt led to a whole variety of ideas.
p128
aVAnd this wasn't about emergency shelter,
p129
aVbut transitional shelter that would last five to 10 years,
p130
aVthat would be placed next to the land the resident lived in,
p131
aVand that they would rebuild their own home.
p132
aVThis wasn't imposing an architecture on a community;
p133
aVthis was giving them the tools and the space
p134
aVto allow them to rebuild and regrow the way they want to.
p135
aVWe had from the sublime to the ridiculous, but they worked.
p136
aVThis is an inflatable hemp house. It was built; it works.
p137
aa(lp138
VThis is a shipping container.
p139
aVBuilt and works.
p140
aVAnd a whole variety of ideas
p141
aVthat not only dealt with architectural building,
p142
aVbut also the issues of governance,
p143
aVand the idea of creating communities through complex networks.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo we've engaged not just designers,
p146
aVbut also a whole variety of technology-based professionals.
p147
aVUsing rubble from destroyed homes to create new homes.
p148
aVUsing straw bale construction, creating heat walls.
p149
aVAnd then something remarkable happened in '99.
p150
aa(lp151
VWe went to Africa originally to look at the housing issue.
p152
aVWithin three days, we realized the problem was not housing;
p153
aVit was the growing pandemic of HIV/AIDS.
p154
aVAnd it wasn't doctors telling us this;
p155
aVit was actual villagers that we were staying with.
p156
aVAnd so we came up with the bright idea
p157
aVthat instead of getting people to walk 10, 15 kilometers to see doctors,
p158
aVyou get the doctors to the people.
p159
aVAnd we started engaging the medical community,
p160
aVand you know, we thought we were real bright sparks \u2014
p161
aV"We've come up with this great idea:
p162
aVmobile health clinics, widely distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa."
p163
aVAnd the medical community there said,
p164
aV"We've said this for the last decade.
p165
aVWe know this. We just don't know how to show this."
p166
aVSo in a way, we had taken pre-existing needs and shown solutions.
p167
aVAnd so again, we had a whole variety of ideas that came in.
p168
aa(lp169
VThis one I personally love,
p170
aVbecause the idea is that architecture is not just about solutions,
p171
aVbut about raising awareness.
p172
aVThis is a kenaf clinic.
p173
aVYou get seed and you grow it in a plot of land,
p174
aVand it grows 14 feet in a month.
p175
aVAnd on the fourth week, the doctors come and they mow out an area,
p176
aVput a tensile structure on the top,
p177
aVand when the doctors have finished treating
p178
aVand seeing patients and villagers,
p179
aVyou cut down the clinic and you eat it.
p180
aVIt's an eat-your-own-clinic.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo it's dealing with the fact that if you have AIDS,
p183
aVyou also need to have nutrition rates,
p184
aVand the idea of nutrition is as important
p185
aVas getting antiretrovirals out there.
p186
aVSo you know, this is a serious solution.
p187
aVThis one I love.
p188
aVThe idea is it's not just a clinic, it's a community center.
p189
aVThis looked at setting up trade routes
p190
aVand economic engines within the community,
p191
aVso it can be a self-sustaining project.
p192
aa(lp193
VEvery one of these projects is sustainable.
p194
aVThat's not because I'm a tree-hugging green person.
p195
aVIt's because when you live on four dollars a day,
p196
aVyou're living on survival and you have to be sustainable.
p197
aVYou have to know where your energy is coming from,
p198
aVyou have to know where your resource is coming from,
p199
aVand you have to keep the maintenance down.
p200
aVSo this is about getting an economic engine,
p201
aVand then at night, it turns into a movie theater.
p202
aVSo it's not an AIDS clinic. It's a community center.
p203
aVSo you can see ideas.
p204
aVAnd these ideas developed into prototypes,
p205
aVand they were eventually built.
p206
aVAnd currently, as of this year,
p207
aVthere are clinics rolling out in Nigeria and Kenya.
p208
aa(lp209
VFrom that, we also developed Siyathemba.
p210
aVThe community came to us and said,
p211
aV"The problem is that the girls don't have education."
p212
aVAnd we're working in an area
p213
aVwhere young women between the ages of 16 and 24
p214
aVhave a 50 percent HIV/AIDS rate.
p215
aVAnd that's not because they're promiscuous,
p216
aVit's because there's no knowledge.
p217
aa(lp218
VAnd so we decided to look at the idea of sports,
p219
aVand create a youth sports center
p220
aVthat doubled as an HIV/AIDS outreach center,
p221
aVand the coaches of the girls' team were also trained doctors.
p222
aVSo that there would be a very slow way of developing confidence in health care.
p223
aVAnd we picked nine finalists,
p224
aVand then those nine finalists were distributed throughout the entire region,
p225
aVand then the community picked their design.
p226
aVThey said, this is our design,
p227
aVbecause it's not only about engaging a community;
p228
aVit's about empowering a community,
p229
aVand about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process.
p230
aa(lp231
VSo, the winning design is here.
p232
aVAnd then, of course, we actually go and work
p233
aVwith the community and the clients.
p234
aa(lp235
VSo this is the designer.
p236
aVHe's out there working with the first ever women's soccer team
p237
aVin KwaZulu-Natal, Siyathemba.
p238
aVAnd they can tell it better.
p239
aa(lp240
V(A cappella singing in a South African language)
p241
aa(lp242
VVideo: Well, my name is Cee Cee Mkhonza.
p243
aVI work at the Africa Centre, I'm an IT user consultant.
p244
aVI'm also the national football player for South Africa, Banyana Banyana.
p245
aVAnd I also play in the Vodacom League, for the team called Tembisa,
p246
aVwhich has now changed to Siyathemba.
p247
aVThis is our home ground.
p248
aa(lp249
VCameron Sinclair: I'm going to show that later because I'm running out of time.
p250
aVI can see Chris looking at me slyly.
p251
aa(lp252
VThis was a connection, just a meeting with somebody
p253
aVwho wanted to develop Africa's first telemedicine center, in Tanzania.
p254
aVAnd we met, literally, a couple of months ago.
p255
aVWe've already developed a design.
p256
aVThe team is over there, working in partnership.
p257
aVThis was a matchmaking, thanks to a couple of TEDsters \u2014
p258
aVSun [Microsystems], Cheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli,
p259
aVwho connected me with this amazing African woman.
p260
aVAnd we start construction in June, and it will be opened by TEDGlobal.
p261
aVSo when you come to TEDGlobal, you can check it out.
p262
aa(lp263
VBut what we're known probably most for is dealing with disasters and development,
p264
aVand we've been involved in a lot of issues,
p265
aVsuch as the tsunami and also things like Hurricane Katrina.
p266
aVThis is a 370-dollar shelter that can be easily assembled.
p267
aVThis is a community-designed community center.
p268
aVAnd what that means is we actually live and work with the community,
p269
aVand they're part of the design process.
p270
aVThe kids actually get involved in mapping out
p271
aVwhere the community center should be.
p272
aVAnd then eventually, the community, through skills training,
p273
aVend up building the building with us.
p274
aa(lp275
VHere is another school.
p276
aVThis is what the UN gave these guys for six months \u2014 12 plastic tarps.
p277
aVThis was in August.
p278
aVThis was the replacement; that's supposed to last for two years.
p279
aVWhen the rain comes down, you can't hear a thing,
p280
aVand in the summer, it's about 140 degrees inside.
p281
aVSo we said, if the rain's coming down, let's get fresh water.
p282
aVSo every one of our schools has a rainwater collection system.
p283
aVVery low cost: three classrooms and rainwater collection is 5,000 dollars.
p284
aVThis was raised by hot chocolate sales in Atlanta.
p285
aVIt's built by the parents of the kids.
p286
aVThe kids are out there on-site, building the buildings.
p287
aVAnd it opened a couple of weeks ago,
p288
aVand there's 600 kids that are now using the schools.
p289
aa(lp290
V(Applause)
p291
aa(lp292
VSo, disaster hits home.
p293
aVWe see the bad stories on CNN and Fox and all that,
p294
aVbut we don't see the good stories.
p295
aVHere is a community that got together, and they said "no" to waiting.
p296
aVThey formed a partnership, a diverse partnership of players,
p297
aVto actually map out East Biloxi,
p298
aVto figure out who's getting involved.
p299
aVWe've had over 1,500 volunteers rebuilding, rehabbing homes.
p300
aVFiguring out what FEMA regulations are,
p301
aVnot waiting for them to dictate to us how you should rebuild.
p302
aVWorking with residents,
p303
aVgetting them out of their homes, so they don't get ill.
p304
aVThis is what they're cleaning up on their own.
p305
aVDesigning housing.
p306
aVThis house is going in in a couple of weeks.
p307
aVThis is a rehabbed home, done in four days.
p308
aVThis is a utility room for a woman who is on a walker.
p309
aVShe's 70 years old. This is what FEMA gave her.
p310
aV600 bucks, happened two days ago.
p311
aVWe put together, very quickly, a washroom.
p312
aVIt's built, it's running and she just started a business today,
p313
aVwhere she's washing other people's clothes.
p314
aa(lp315
VThese are the Calhouns.
p316
aVThey're photographers who had documented the Lower Ninth for the last 40 years.
p317
aVThat was their home, and these are the photographs they took.
p318
aVAnd we're helping, working with them to create a new building.
p319
aVProjects we've done.
p320
aVProjects we've been a part of, support.
p321
aVWhy don't aid agencies do this?
p322
aVThis is the UN tent.
p323
aVThis is the new UN tent, just introduced this year.
p324
aVQuick to assemble.
p325
aVIt's got a flap \u2014 that's the invention.
p326
aVIt took 20 years to design this and get it implemented in the field.
p327
aVI was 12 years old.
p328
aVThere's a problem here.
p329
aa(lp330
VLuckily, we're not alone.
p331
aVThere are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
p332
aVand hundreds of architects and designers and inventors
p333
aVaround the world that are getting involved in humanitarian work.
p334
aVMore hemp houses \u2014 it's a theme in Japan, apparently.
p335
aVI'm not sure what they're smoking.
p336
aa(lp337
V(Laughter)
p338
aa(lp339
VThis is a Grip Clip, designed by somebody who said,
p340
aV"All you need is some way to attach membrane structures
p341
aVto physical support beams."
p342
aVThis guy designed for NASA, is now doing housing.
p343
aVI'm going to whip through this quickly,
p344
aVbecause I know I've got only a couple of minutes.
p345
aa(lp346
VSo this is all done in the last two years.
p347
aVI showed you something that took 20 years to do.
p348
aVAnd this is just a selection of things
p349
aVthat were built in the last couple of years.
p350
aVFrom Brazil to India,
p351
aVMexico,
p352
aVAlabama,
p353
aVChina,
p354
aVIsrael,
p355
aVPalestine,
p356
aVVietnam.
p357
aa(lp358
VThe average age of a designer who gets involved in this project is 32 \u2014
p359
aVthat's how old I am.
p360
aVSo it's a young \u2014
p361
aVI just have to stop here, because Arup is in the room,
p362
aVand this is the best-designed toilet in the world.
p363
aVIf you're ever, ever in India, go use this toilet.
p364
aa(lp365
V(Laughter)
p366
aa(lp367
VChris Luebkeman will tell you why.
p368
aVI'm sure that's how he wanted to spend the party.
p369
aVBut the future is not going to be the sky-scraping cities of New York,
p370
aVbut this.
p371
aVAnd when you look at this, you see crisis.
p372
aVWhat I see is many, many inventors.
p373
aVOne billion people live in abject poverty.
p374
aVWe hear about them all the time.
p375
aVFour billion live in growing but fragile economies.
p376
aVOne in seven live in unplanned settlements.
p377
aVIf we do nothing about the housing crisis that's about to happen,
p378
aVin 20 years, one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement
p379
aVor a refugee camp.
p380
aVLook left, look right: one of you will be there.
p381
aVHow do we improve the living standards of five billion people?
p382
aVWith 10 million solutions.
p383
aa(lp384
VSo I wish to develop a community
p385
aVthat actively embraces innovative and sustainable design
p386
aVto improve the living conditions for everyone.
p387
aa(lp388
VChris Anderson: Wait a sec \u2014 that's your wish?
p389
aa(lp390
VCS: That's my wish.
p391
aa(lp392
VCA: That's his wish!
p393
aa(lp394
V(Applause)
p395
aa(lp396
VCS: We started Architecture for Humanity with 700 dollars and a website.
p397
aVSo Chris somehow decided to give me 100,000.
p398
aVSo why not this many people?
p399
aVOpen-source architecture is the way to go.
p400
aVYou have a diverse community of participants \u2014
p401
aVand we're not just talking about inventors and designers,
p402
aVbut we're talking about the funding model.
p403
aVMy role is not as a designer;
p404
aVit's as a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world.
p405
aVAnd what we need is something that replicates me globally,
p406
aVbecause I haven't slept in seven years.
p407
aa(lp408
V(Laughter)
p409
aa(lp410
VSecondly, what will this thing be?
p411
aVDesigners want to respond to issues of humanitarian crisis,
p412
aVbut they don't want some company in the West
p413
aVtaking their idea and basically profiting from it.
p414
aVSo Creative Commons has developed the Developing Nations license.
p415
aVAnd what that means is that a designer can \u2014
p416
aVThe Siyathemba project I showed
p417
aVwas the first ever building to have a Creative Commons license on it.
p418
aVAs soon as that is built, anyone in Africa or any developing nation
p419
aVcan take the construction documents and replicate it for free.
p420
aa(lp421
V(Applause)
p422
aa(lp423
VSo why not allow designers the opportunity to do this,
p424
aVbut still protect their rights here?
p425
aVWe want to have a community where you can upload ideas,
p426
aVand those ideas can be tested in an earthquake, in flood,
p427
aVin all sorts of austere environments.
p428
aVThe reason that's important
p429
aVis I don't want to wait for the next Katrina
p430
aVto find out if my house works.
p431
aVThat's too late, we need to do it now.
p432
aVSo doing that globally \u2014
p433
aVand I want this whole thing to work multi-lingually.
p434
aVWhen you look at the face of an architect, most people think a gray-haired white guy.
p435
aVI don't see that; I see the face of the world.
p436
aVSo I want everyone from all over the planet
p437
aVto be able to be a part of this design and development.
p438
aVThe idea of needs-based competitions \u2014
p439
aVXPRIZE for the other 98 percent, if you want to call it that.
p440
aa(lp441
VWe also want to look at ways of matchmaking
p442
aVand putting funding partners together,
p443
aVand the idea of integrating manufacturers \u2014
p444
aVfab labs in every country.
p445
aVWhen I hear about the $100 laptop and it's going to educate every child \u2014
p446
aVeducate every designer in the world.
p447
aVPut one in every favela, every slum settlement.
p448
aVBecause you know what? Innovation will happen.
p449
aVAnd I need to know that. It's called the leap-back.
p450
aVWe talk about leapfrog technologies.
p451
aa(lp452
VI write with Worldchanging,
p453
aVand the one thing we've been talking about is,
p454
aVI learn more on the ground than I've ever learned here.
p455
aVSo let's take those ideas, adapt them, and we can use them.
p456
aVThese ideas are supposed to be adaptable;
p457
aVthey should have the potential for evolution;
p458
aVthey should be developed by every nation in the world
p459
aVand useful for every nation in the world.
p460
aVWhat will it take?
p461
aa(lp462
VThere should be a sheet.
p463
aVI don't have time to read this, because I'm going to be yanked off.
p464
aa(lp465
VCA: Let's just leave it up for a sec.
p466
aa(lp467
VCS: Well, what will it take? You guys are smart.
p468
aVSo it's going to take a lot of computing power,
p469
aVbecause I want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world
p470
aVcan plug into the system
p471
aVand be able to not only participate in developing these designs,
p472
aVbut utilize the designs.
p473
aVAlso, a process of reviewing the designs.
p474
aVI want every Arup engineer in the world to check and make sure
p475
aVthat we're doing stuff that's standing,
p476
aVbecause those guys are the best in the world.
p477
aVPlug.
p478
aVAnd so, you know, I want these \u2014
p479
aa(lp480
VI just should note: I have two laptops and one of them is there,
p481
aVand that has 3000 designs on it.
p482
aVIf I drop that laptop ...
p483
aVWhat happens?
p484
aVSo it's important to have these proven ideas put up there,
p485
aVeasy to use, easy to get ahold of.
p486
aVMy mom once said, "There's nothing worse than being all mouth and no trousers."
p487
aa(lp488
V(Laughter)
p489
aa(lp490
VI'm fed up of talking about making change.
p491
aVYou only make it by doing it.
p492
aVWe've changed FEMA guidelines; we've changed public policy;
p493
aVwe've changed international response \u2014 based on building things.
p494
aVSo for me, it's important that we create a real conduit for innovation,
p495
aVand that it's free innovation.
p496
aVThink of free culture \u2014 this is free innovation.
p497
aVSomebody said this a couple of years back.
p498
aVI will give points for those who know it.
p499
aVBut I think the man was maybe 25 years too early.
p500
aa(lp501
VSo let's do it.
p502
aa(lp503
VThank you.

Starting with just $700 and a simple web site in 1999, <a href=\\"http://www.architectureforhumanity.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">AFH</a>  has grown into an international hub for humanitarian design, offering <strong>innovative solutions to housing problems in all corners of the globe</strong>. <br /><br />Whether rebuilding earthquake-ravaged Bam in Iran, designing a soccer field doubling as an HIV/AIDS clinic in Africa, housing refugees on the Afghan border, or helping Katrina victims rebuild, <a href=\\"http://www.architectureforhumanity.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Architecture for Humanity</a>  works by Sinclair&#39;s mantra: &quot;<strong>Design like you give a damn</strong>.&quot; (Sinclair and Stohr cowrote <a href=\\"http://geni.us/giveadamndesign\\" target=\\"_blank\\">a book</a>  by the same name, released in 2006.) <br /><br />A regular contributor to the sustainability blog <a href=\\"http://www.worldchanging.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Worldchanging.com</a>, Sinclair is now working on the <a href=\\"http://www.openarchitecturenetwork.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Open Architecture Network</a>, born from the wish he made when he accepted the <a href=\\"/pages/view/id/108\\" target=\\"_blank\\">2006 TED Prize</a>: to build <strong>a global, open-source network where architects, governments and NGOs can share and implement design plans</strong> to house the world.</p>", "slug": "cameron_sinclair", "whotheyare": "2006 TED Prize winner Cameron Sinclair is co-founder of Architecture for Humanity, a nonprofit that seeks architecture solutions to global crises -- and acts as a conduit between the design community and the world\'s humanitarian needs.", "whatotherssay": "Cameron Sinclair is doing his best to save the world, one emergency shelter and mobile AIDS clinic at a time.", "id": 54, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/1319_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "My wish: A call for open-source architecture", "take_action": [], "comments": 52, "more_resources": [{"status": "approved", "start_at": null, "headline": "Cameron Sinclair\'s TED Prize wish", "link_url": "http://www.ted.com/participate/ted-prize/prize-winning-wishes/open-architecture-network-cameron-sinclair", "eyebrow": null, "end_at": null, "image_url": "", "published": true, "visible_url": "", "type": "from_the_blog", "blurb": "The architect\'s goal is to create an open-source platform to foster collaborative building design.

VWhat do you think of when I say the word "design"?
p5
aVYou probably think of things like this,
p6
aVfinely crafted objects that you can hold in your hand,
p7
aVor maybe logos and posters and maps
p8
aVthat visually explain things,
p9
aVclassic icons of timeless design.
p10
aVBut I'm not here to talk about that kind of design.
p11
aVI want to talk about the kind
p12
aVthat you probably use every day
p13
aVand may not give much thought to,
p14
aVdesigns that change all the time
p15
aVand that live inside your pocket.
p16
aVI'm talking about the design
p17
aVof digital experiences
p18
aVand specifically the design of systems
p19
aVthat are so big that their scale
p20
aVcan be hard to comprehend.
p21
aVConsider the fact that Google processes
p22
aVover one billion search queries every day,
p23
aVthat every minute, over 100 hours
p24
aVof footage are uploaded to YouTube.
p25
aVThat's more in a single day
p26
aVthan all three major U.S. networks broadcast
p27
aVin the last five years combined.
p28
aVAnd Facebook transmitting the photos,
p29
aVmessages and stories
p30
aVof over 1.23 billion people.
p31
aVThat's almost half of the Internet population,
p32
aVand a sixth of humanity.
p33
aa(lp34
VThese are some of the products
p35
aVthat I've helped design over the course of my career,
p36
aVand their scale is so massive
p37
aVthat they've produced unprecedented
p38
aVdesign challenges.
p39
aVBut what is really hard
p40
aVabout designing at scale is this:
p41
aVIt's hard in part because
p42
aVit requires a combination of two things,
p43
aVaudacity and humility \u2014
p44
aVaudacity to believe that the thing that you're making
p45
aVis something that the entire world wants and needs,
p46
aVand humility to understand that as a designer,
p47
aVit's not about you or your portfolio,
p48
aVit's about the people that you're designing for,
p49
aVand how your work just might help them
p50
aVlive better lives.
p51
aVNow, unfortunately, there's no school
p52
aVthat offers the course Designing for Humanity 101.
p53
aVI and the other designers
p54
aVwho work on these kinds of products
p55
aVhave had to invent it as we go along,
p56
aVand we are teaching ourselves
p57
aVthe emerging best practices
p58
aVof designing at scale,
p59
aVand today I'd like share some of the things
p60
aVthat we've learned over the years.
p61
aa(lp62
VNow, the first thing that you need to know
p63
aVabout designing at scale
p64
aVis that the little things really matter.
p65
aVHere's a really good example of how
p66
aVa very tiny design element can make a big impact.
p67
aVThe team at Facebook that manages
p68
aVthe Facebook "Like" button
p69
aVdecided that it needed to be redesigned.
p70
aVThe button had kind of gotten out of sync
p71
aVwith the evolution of our brand
p72
aVand it needed to be modernized.
p73
aVNow you might think, well, it's a tiny little button,
p74
aVit probably is a pretty straightforward,
p75
aVeasy design assignment, but it wasn't.
p76
aVTurns out, there were all kinds of constraints
p77
aVfor the design of this button.
p78
aVYou had to work within specific height and width parameters.
p79
aVYou had to be careful to make it work
p80
aVin a bunch of different languages,
p81
aVand be careful about using fancy gradients or borders
p82
aVbecause it has to degrade gracefully
p83
aVin old web browsers.
p84
aVThe truth is, designing this tiny little button
p85
aVwas a huge pain in the butt.
p86
aa(lp87
VNow, this is the new version of the button,
p88
aVand the designer who led this project estimates
p89
aVthat he spent over 280 hours
p90
aVredesigning this button over the course of months.
p91
aVNow, why would we spend so much time
p92
aVon something so small?
p93
aVIt's because when you're designing at scale,
p94
aVthere's no such thing as a small detail.
p95
aVThis innocent little button
p96
aVis seen on average 22 billion times a day
p97
aVand on over 7.5 million websites.
p98
aVIt's one of the single most viewed design elements ever created.
p99
aVNow that's a lot of pressure for a little button
p100
aVand the designer behind it,
p101
aVbut with these kinds of products,
p102
aVyou need to get even the tiny things right.
p103
aa(lp104
VNow, the next thing that you need to understand
p105
aVis how to design with data.
p106
aVNow, when you're working on products like this,
p107
aVyou have incredible amounts of information
p108
aVabout how people are using your product
p109
aVthat you can then use to influence
p110
aVyour design decisions,
p111
aVbut it's not just as simple as following the numbers.
p112
aVLet me give you an example
p113
aVso that you can understand what I mean.
p114
aVFacebook has had a tool for a long time
p115
aVthat allowed people to report photos
p116
aVthat may be in violation of our community standards,
p117
aVthings like spam and abuse.
p118
aVAnd there were a ton of photos reported,
p119
aVbut as it turns out,
p120
aVonly a small percentage were actually
p121
aVin violation of those community standards.
p122
aVMost of them were just your typical party photo.
p123
aVNow, to give you a specific hypothetical example,
p124
aVlet's say my friend Laura hypothetically
p125
aVuploads a picture of me
p126
aVfrom a drunken night of karaoke.
p127
aVThis is purely hypothetical, I can assure you.
p128
aV(Laughter)
p129
aVNow, incidentally,
p130
aVyou know how some people are kind of worried
p131
aVthat their boss or employee
p132
aVis going to discover embarrassing photos of them
p133
aVon Facebook?
p134
aVDo you know how hard that is to avoid
p135
aVwhen you actually work at Facebook?
p136
aVSo anyway, there are lots of these photos
p137
aVbeing erroneously reported as spam and abuse,
p138
aVand one of the engineers on the team had a hunch.
p139
aVHe really thought there was something else going on
p140
aVand he was right,
p141
aVbecause when he looked through a bunch of the cases,
p142
aVhe found that most of them
p143
aVwere from people who were requesting
p144
aVthe takedown of a photo of themselves.
p145
aVNow this was a scenario that the team
p146
aVnever even took into account before.
p147
aVSo they added a new feature
p148
aVthat allowed people to message their friend
p149
aVto ask them to take the photo down.
p150
aVBut it didn't work.
p151
aVOnly 20 percent of people
p152
aVsent the message to their friend.
p153
aVSo the team went back at it.
p154
aVThey consulted with experts in conflict resolution.
p155
aVThey even studied the universal principles
p156
aVof polite language,
p157
aVwhich I didn't even actually know existed
p158
aVuntil this research happened.
p159
aVAnd they found something really interesting.
p160
aVThey had to go beyond just helping people
p161
aVask their friend to take the photo down.
p162
aVThey had to help people express to their friend
p163
aVhow the photo made them feel.
p164
aa(lp165
VHere's how the experience works today.
p166
aVSo I find this hypothetical photo of myself,
p167
aVand it's not spam, it's not abuse,
p168
aVbut I really wish it weren't on the site.
p169
aVSo I report it and I say,
p170
aV"I'm in this photo and I don't like it,"
p171
aVand then we dig deeper.
p172
aVWhy don't you like this photo of yourself?
p173
aVAnd I select "It's embarrassing."
p174
aVAnd then I'm encouraged to message my friend,
p175
aVbut here's the critical difference.
p176
aVI'm provided specific suggested language
p177
aVthat helps me communicate to Laura
p178
aVhow the photo makes me feel.
p179
aVNow the team found that this relatively small change
p180
aVhad a huge impact.
p181
aVBefore, only 20 percent of people
p182
aVwere sending the message,
p183
aVand now 60 percent were,
p184
aVand surveys showed that people
p185
aVon both sides of the conversation
p186
aVfelt better as a result.
p187
aVThat same survey showed
p188
aVthat 90 percent of your friends
p189
aVwant to know if they've done something to upset you.
p190
aVNow I don't know who the other 10 percent are,
p191
aVbut maybe that's where our "Unfriend" feature
p192
aVcan come in handy.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo as you can see,
p195
aVthese decisions are highly nuanced.
p196
aVOf course we use a lot of data
p197
aVto inform our decisions,
p198
aVbut we also rely very heavily on iteration,
p199
aVresearch, testing, intuition, human empathy.
p200
aVIt's both art and science.
p201
aVNow, sometimes the designers who work on these products
p202
aVare called "data-driven,"
p203
aVwhich is a term that totally drives us bonkers.
p204
aVThe fact is, it would be irresponsible of us
p205
aVnot to rigorously test our designs
p206
aVwhen so many people are counting on us
p207
aVto get it right,
p208
aVbut data analytics
p209
aVwill never be a substitute for design intuition.
p210
aVData can help you make a good design great,
p211
aVbut it will never made a bad design good.
p212
aa(lp213
VThe next thing that you need to understand as a principle
p214
aVis that when you introduce change,
p215
aVyou need to do it extraordinarily carefully.
p216
aVNow I often have joked that
p217
aVI spend almost as much time
p218
aVdesigning the introduction of change
p219
aVas I do the change itself,
p220
aVand I'm sure that we can all relate to that
p221
aVwhen something that we use a lot changes
p222
aVand then we have to adjust.
p223
aVThe fact is, people can become
p224
aVvery efficient at using bad design,
p225
aVand so even if the change is good for them in the long run,
p226
aVit's still incredibly frustrating when it happens,
p227
aVand this is particularly true
p228
aVwith user-generated content platforms,
p229
aVbecause people can rightfully claim a sense of ownership.
p230
aVIt is, after all, their content.
p231
aa(lp232
VNow, years ago, when I was working at YouTube,
p233
aVwe were looking for ways to
p234
aVencourage more people to rate videos,
p235
aVand it was interesting because when we looked into the data,
p236
aVwe found that almost everyone was exclusively using
p237
aVthe highest five-star rating,
p238
aVa handful of people were using
p239
aVthe lowest one-star,
p240
aVand virtually no one
p241
aVwas using two, three or four stars.
p242
aVSo we decided to simplify
p243
aVinto an up-down kind of voting binary model.
p244
aVIt's going to be much easier for people to engage with.
p245
aVBut people were very attached
p246
aVto the five-star rating system.
p247
aVVideo creators really loved their ratings.
p248
aVMillions and millions of people
p249
aVwere accustomed to the old design.
p250
aVSo in order to help people
p251
aVprepare themselves for change
p252
aVand acclimate to the new design more quickly,
p253
aVwe actually published the data graph
p254
aVsharing with the community
p255
aVthe rationale for what we were going to do,
p256
aVand it even engaged the larger industry
p257
aVin a conversation, which resulted in
p258
aVmy favorite TechCrunch headline of all time:
p259
aV"YouTube Comes to a 5-Star Realization:
p260
aVIts Ratings Are Useless."
p261
aa(lp262
VNow, it's impossible to completely avoid
p263
aVchange aversion when you're making changes
p264
aVto products that so many people use.
p265
aVEven though we tried to do all the right things,
p266
aVwe still received our customary flood
p267
aVof video protests and angry emails
p268
aVand even a package that had to be scanned by security,
p269
aVbut we have to remember
p270
aVpeople care intensely about this stuff,
p271
aVand it's because these products, this work,
p272
aVreally, really matters to them.
p273
aa(lp274
VNow, we know that we have to be careful
p275
aVabout paying attention to the details,
p276
aVwe have to be cognizant about how we use data
p277
aVin our design process,
p278
aVand we have to introduce change
p279
aVvery, very carefully.
p280
aVNow, these things are all really useful.
p281
aVThey're good best practices for designing at scale.
p282
aVBut they don't mean anything
p283
aVif you don't understand something
p284
aVmuch more fundamental.
p285
aVYou have to understand who you are designing for.
p286
aa(lp287
VNow, when you set a goal to design
p288
aVfor the entire human race,
p289
aVand you start to engage in that goal in earnest,
p290
aVat some point you run into the walls
p291
aVof the bubble that you're living in.
p292
aVNow, in San Francisco, we get a little miffed
p293
aVwhen we hit a dead cell zone
p294
aVbecause we can't use our phones to navigate
p295
aVto the new hipster coffee shop.
p296
aVBut what if you had to drive four hours
p297
aVto charge your phone
p298
aVbecause you had no reliable source of electricity?
p299
aVWhat if you had no access to public libraries?
p300
aVWhat if your country had no free press?
p301
aVWhat would these products start to mean to you?
p302
aVThis is what Google, YouTube and Facebook
p303
aVlook like to most of the world,
p304
aVand it's what they'll look like
p305
aVto most of the next five billion people
p306
aVto come online.
p307
aVDesigning for low-end cell phones
p308
aVis not glamorous design work,
p309
aVbut if you want to design for the whole world,
p310
aVyou have to design for where people are,
p311
aVand not where you are.
p312
aa(lp313
VSo how do we keep this big, big picture in mind?
p314
aVWe try to travel outside of our bubble to see, hear
p315
aVand understand the people we're designing for.
p316
aVWe use our products in non-English languages
p317
aVto make sure that they work just as well.
p318
aVAnd we try to use one of these phones from time to time
p319
aVto keep in touch with their reality.
p320
aa(lp321
VSo what does it mean to design at a global scale?
p322
aVIt means difficult and sometimes exasperating work
p323
aVto try to improve and evolve products.
p324
aVFinding the audacity and the humility to do right by them
p325
aVcan be pretty exhausting,
p326
aVand the humility part,
p327
aVit's a little tough on the design ego.
p328
aVBecause these products are always changing,
p329
aVeverything that I've designed in my career
p330
aVis pretty much gone,
p331
aVand everything that I will design will fade away.
p332
aVBut here's what remains:
p333
aVthe never-ending thrill
p334
aVof being a part of something that is so big,
p335
aVyou can hardly get your head around it,
p336
aVand the promise that it just might change the world.
p337
aa(lp338
VThank you.

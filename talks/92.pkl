VAbout 10 years ago, I took on the task to teach global development
p5
aVto Swedish undergraduate students.
p6
aVThat was after having spent about 20 years
p7
aVtogether with African institutions studying hunger in Africa,
p8
aVso I was sort of expected to know a little about the world.
p9
aVAnd I started in our medical university, Karolinska Institute,
p10
aVan undergraduate course called Global Health.
p11
aVBut when you get that opportunity, you get a little nervous.
p12
aVI thought, these students coming to us
p13
aVactually have the highest grade you can get in Swedish college systems \u2014
p14
aVso I thought, maybe they know everything I'm going to teach them about.
p15
aVSo I did a pre-test when they came.
p16
aVAnd one of the questions from which I learned a lot was this one:
p17
aV"Which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairs?"
p18
aa(lp19
VI put them together, so that in each pair of country,
p20
aVone has twice the child mortality of the other.
p21
aVAnd this means that it's much bigger a difference
p22
aVthan the uncertainty of the data.
p23
aVI won't put you at a test here, but it's Turkey,
p24
aVwhich is highest there, Poland, Russia, Pakistan and South Africa.
p25
aVAnd these were the results of the Swedish students.
p26
aVI did it so I got the confidence interval, which is pretty narrow, and I got happy,
p27
aVof course: a 1.8 right answer out of five possible.
p28
aVThat means that there was a place for a professor of international health
p29
aVand for my course.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VBut one late night, when I was compiling the report,
p34
aVI really realized my discovery.
p35
aVI have shown that Swedish top students
p36
aVknow statistically significantly less about the world than the chimpanzees.
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VBecause the chimpanzee would score half right
p41
aVif I gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey.
p42
aVThey would be right half of the cases. But the students are not there.
p43
aVThe problem for me was not ignorance; it was preconceived ideas.
p44
aa(lp45
VI did also an unethical study
p46
aVof the professors of the Karolinska Institute,
p47
aVthat hands out the Nobel Prize in Medicine,
p48
aVand they are on par with the chimpanzee there.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VThis is where I realized that there was really a need to communicate,
p53
aVbecause the data of what's happening in the world
p54
aVand the child health of every country is very well aware.
p55
aa(lp56
VWe did this software which displays it like this:
p57
aVevery bubble here is a country.
p58
aVThis country over here is China.
p59
aVThis is India.
p60
aVThe size of the bubble is the population,
p61
aVand on this axis here, I put fertility rate.
p62
aVBecause my students, what they said
p63
aVwhen they looked upon the world, and I asked them,
p64
aV"What do you really think about the world?"
p65
aVWell, I first discovered that the textbook was Tintin, mainly.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd they said, "The world is still 'we' and 'them.'
p70
aVAnd 'we' is Western world and 'them' is Third World."
p71
aV"And what do you mean with Western world?" I said.
p72
aV"Well, that's long life and small family,
p73
aVand Third World is short life and large family."
p74
aa(lp75
VSo this is what I could display here.
p76
aVI put fertility rate here: number of children per woman:
p77
aVone, two, three, four, up to about eight children per woman.
p78
aVWe have very good data since 1962 \u2014 1960 about \u2014
p79
aVon the size of families in all countries.
p80
aVThe error margin is narrow.
p81
aVHere, I put life expectancy at birth,
p82
aVfrom 30 years in some countries up to about 70 years.
p83
aVAnd 1962, there was really a group of countries here
p84
aVthat was industrialized countries,
p85
aVand they had small families and long lives.
p86
aVAnd these were the developing countries:
p87
aVthey had large families and they had relatively short lives.
p88
aVNow, what has happened since 1962? We want to see the change.
p89
aVAre the students right? Is it still two types of countries?
p90
aVOr have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here?
p91
aVOr have they got longer lives and live up there?
p92
aa(lp93
VLet's see. We stopped the world then.
p94
aVThis is all U.N. statistics that have been available.
p95
aVHere we go. Can you see there?
p96
aVIt's China there, moving against better health there, improving there.
p97
aVAll the green Latin American countries are moving towards smaller families.
p98
aVYour yellow ones here are the Arabic countries,
p99
aVand they get longer life, but not larger families.
p100
aVThe Africans are the green here. They still remain here.
p101
aVThis is India; Indonesia is moving on pretty fast.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VIn the '80s here, you have Bangladesh still among the African countries.
p106
aVBut now, Bangladesh \u2014 it's a miracle that happens in the '80s:
p107
aVthe imams start to promote family planning.
p108
aVThey move up into that corner.
p109
aVAnd in the '90s, we have the terrible HIV epidemic
p110
aVthat takes down the life expectancy of the African countries
p111
aVand all the rest of them move up into the corner,
p112
aVwhere we have long lives and small family, and we have a completely new world.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Applause)
p115
aa(lp116
V(Applause ends)
p117
aa(lp118
VLet me make a comparison directly
p119
aVbetween the United States of America and Vietnam.
p120
aV1964.
p121
aVAmerica had small families and long life;
p122
aVVietnam had large families and short lives.
p123
aVAnd this is what happens:
p124
aVthe data during the war indicate that even with all the death,
p125
aVthere was an improvement of life expectancy.
p126
aVBy the end of the year, the family planning started in Vietnam;
p127
aVthey went for smaller families.
p128
aVAnd the United States up there is getting for longer life,
p129
aVkeeping family size.
p130
aVAnd in the '80s now, they give up Communist planning
p131
aVand they go for market economy,
p132
aVand it moves faster even than social life.
p133
aVAnd today, we have in Vietnam
p134
aVthe same life expectancy and the same family size
p135
aVhere in Vietnam, 2003,
p136
aVas in United States, 1974, by the end of the war.
p137
aVIf we don't look in the data,
p138
aVI think we all underestimate the tremendous change in Asia,
p139
aVwhich was in social change before we saw the economical change.
p140
aa(lp141
VLet's move over to another way here in which we could display
p142
aVthe distribution in the world of the income.
p143
aVThis is the world distribution of income of people.
p144
aVOne dollar, 10 dollars or 100 dollars per day.
p145
aVThere's no gap between rich and poor any longer. This is a myth.
p146
aVThere's a little hump here.
p147
aVBut there are people all the way.
p148
aVAnd if we look where the income ends up,
p149
aVthis is 100 percent the world's annual income.
p150
aVAnd the richest 20 percent,
p151
aVthey take out of that about 74 percent.
p152
aVAnd the poorest 20 percent, they take about two percent.
p153
aVAnd this shows that the concept of developing countries
p154
aVis extremely doubtful.
p155
aVWe think about aid,
p156
aVlike these people here giving aid to these people here.
p157
aVBut in the middle, we have most of the world population,
p158
aVand they have now 24 percent of the income.
p159
aa(lp160
VWe heard it in other forms. And who are these?
p161
aVWhere are the different countries? I can show you Africa.
p162
aVThis is Africa.
p163
aV10% the world population, most in poverty.
p164
aVThis is OECD.
p165
aVThe rich country. The country club of the U.N.
p166
aVAnd they are over here on this side. Quite an overlap between Africa and OECD.
p167
aVAnd this is Latin America.
p168
aVIt has everything on this Earth, from the poorest to the richest
p169
aVin Latin America.
p170
aVAnd on top of that, we can put East Europe,
p171
aVwe can put East Asia, and we put South Asia.
p172
aa(lp173
VAnd how did it look like if we go back in time,
p174
aVto about 1970?
p175
aVThen there was more of a hump.
p176
aVAnd we have most who lived in absolute poverty were Asians.
p177
aVThe problem in the world was the poverty in Asia.
p178
aVAnd if I now let the world move forward,
p179
aVyou will see that while population increases,
p180
aVthere are hundreds of millions in Asia getting out of poverty
p181
aVand some others getting into poverty,
p182
aVand this is the pattern we have today.
p183
aVAnd the best projection from the World Bank
p184
aVis that this will happen,
p185
aVand we will not have a divided world.
p186
aVWe'll have most people in the middle.
p187
aa(lp188
VOf course it's a logarithmic scale here,
p189
aVbut our concept of economy is growth with percent.
p190
aVWe look upon it as a possibility of percentile increase.
p191
aVIf I change this, and take GDP per capita instead of family income,
p192
aVand I turn these individual data
p193
aVinto regional data of gross domestic product,
p194
aVand I take the regions down here,
p195
aVthe size of the bubble is still the population.
p196
aVAnd you have the OECD there, and you have sub-Saharan Africa there,
p197
aVand we take off the Arab states there,
p198
aVcoming both from Africa and from Asia, and we put them separately,
p199
aVand we can expand this axis, and I can give it a new dimension here,
p200
aVby adding the social values there, child survival.
p201
aVNow I have money on that axis,
p202
aVand I have the possibility of children to survive there.
p203
aVIn some countries, 99.7% of children survive to five years of age;
p204
aVothers, only 70.
p205
aVAnd here, it seems, there is a gap between OECD,
p206
aVLatin America, East Europe, East Asia,
p207
aVArab states, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
p208
aVThe linearity is very strong between child survival and money.
p209
aa(lp210
VBut let me split sub-Saharan Africa.
p211
aVHealth is there and better health is up there.
p212
aVI can go here and I can split sub-Saharan Africa into its countries.
p213
aVAnd when it burst,
p214
aVthe size of its country bubble is the size of the population.
p215
aVSierra Leone down there. Mauritius is up there.
p216
aVMauritius was the first country
p217
aVto get away with trade barriers, and they could sell their sugar \u2014
p218
aVthey could sell their textiles \u2014
p219
aVon equal terms as the people in Europe and North America.
p220
aa(lp221
VThere's a huge difference between Africa. And Ghana is here in the middle.
p222
aVIn Sierra Leone, humanitarian aid.
p223
aVHere in Uganda, development aid.
p224
aVHere, time to invest; there, you can go for a holiday.
p225
aVIt's a tremendous variation within Africa
p226
aVwhich we rarely often make \u2014 that it's equal everything.
p227
aVI can split South Asia here. India's the big bubble in the middle.
p228
aVBut a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.
p229
aVI can split Arab states. How are they?
p230
aVSame climate, same culture, same religion \u2014 huge difference.
p231
aVEven between neighbors.
p232
aVYemen, civil war.
p233
aVUnited Arab Emirates, money, which was quite equally and well used.
p234
aVNot as the myth is.
p235
aVAnd that includes all the children of the foreign workers
p236
aVwho are in the country.
p237
aa(lp238
VData is often better than you think. Many people say data is bad.
p239
aVThere is an uncertainty margin, but we can see the difference here:
p240
aVCambodia, Singapore.
p241
aVThe differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data.
p242
aVEast Europe: Soviet economy for a long time,
p243
aVbut they come out after 10 years very, very differently.
p244
aVAnd there is Latin America.
p245
aVToday, we don't have to go to Cuba
p246
aVto find a healthy country in Latin America.
p247
aVChile will have a lower child mortality than Cuba within some few years from now.
p248
aVHere, we have high-income countries in the OECD.
p249
aa(lp250
VAnd we get the whole pattern here of the world,
p251
aVwhich is more or less like this.
p252
aVAnd if we look at it, how the world looks,
p253
aVin 1960, it starts to move.
p254
aVThis is Mao Tse-tung. He brought health to China.
p255
aVAnd then he died.
p256
aVAnd then Deng Xiaoping came and brought money to China,
p257
aVand brought them into the mainstream again.
p258
aVAnd we have seen how countries move in different directions like this,
p259
aVso it's sort of difficult to get an example country
p260
aVwhich shows the pattern of the world.
p261
aa(lp262
VBut I would like to bring you back to about here, at 1960.
p263
aVI would like to compare
p264
aVSouth Korea, which is this one, with Brazil, which is this one.
p265
aVThe label went away for me here.
p266
aVAnd I would like to compare Uganda, which is there.
p267
aVAnd I can run it forward, like this.
p268
aVAnd you can see how South Korea is making a very, very fast advancement,
p269
aVwhereas Brazil is much slower.
p270
aa(lp271
VAnd if we move back again, here, and we put on trails on them, like this,
p272
aVyou can see again that the speed of development
p273
aVis very, very different,
p274
aVand the countries are moving more or less in the same rate as money and health,
p275
aVbut it seems you can move much faster
p276
aVif you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first.
p277
aVAnd to show that, you can put on the way of United Arab Emirates.
p278
aVThey came from here, a mineral country.
p279
aVThey cached all the oil; they got all the money;
p280
aVbut health cannot be bought at the supermarket.
p281
aVYou have to invest in health. You have to get kids into schooling.
p282
aVYou have to train health staff. You have to educate the population.
p283
aVAnd Sheikh Zayed did that in a fairly good way.
p284
aVIn spite of falling oil prices, he brought this country up here.
p285
aVSo we've got a much more mainstream appearance of the world,
p286
aVwhere all countries tend to use their money
p287
aVbetter than they used in the past.
p288
aa(lp289
VNow, this is, more or less, if you look at the average data of the countries \u2014
p290
aVthey are like this.
p291
aVNow that's dangerous, to use average data,
p292
aVbecause there is such a lot of difference within countries.
p293
aVSo if I go and look here, we can see that Uganda today
p294
aVis where South Korea was in 1960.
p295
aVIf I split Uganda, there's quite a difference within Uganda.
p296
aVThese are the quintiles of Uganda.
p297
aVThe richest 20 percent of Ugandans are there.
p298
aVThe poorest are down there.
p299
aVIf I split South Africa, it's like this.
p300
aVAnd if I go down and look at Niger,
p301
aVwhere there was such a terrible famine, lastly, it's like this.
p302
aVThe 20 percent poorest of Niger is out here,
p303
aVand the 20 percent richest of South Africa is there,
p304
aVand yet we tend to discuss
p305
aVon what solutions there should be in Africa.
p306
aVEverything in this world exists in Africa.
p307
aVAnd you can't discuss universal access to HIV [medicine]
p308
aVfor that quintile up here with the same strategy as down here.
p309
aVThe improvement of the world must be highly contextualized,
p310
aVand it's not relevant to have it on regional level.
p311
aVWe must be much more detailed.
p312
aVWe find that students get very excited when they can use this.
p313
aa(lp314
VAnd even more, policy makers and the corporate sectors
p315
aVwould like to see how the world is changing.
p316
aVNow, why doesn't this take place?
p317
aVWhy are we not using the data we have?
p318
aVWe have data in the United Nations, in the national statistical agencies
p319
aVand in universities and other non-governmental organizations.
p320
aVBecause the data is hidden down in the databases.
p321
aVAnd the public is there, and the Internet is there,
p322
aVbut we have still not used it effectively.
p323
aa(lp324
VAll that information we saw changing in the world
p325
aVdoes not include publicly-funded statistics.
p326
aVThere are some web pages like this, you know,
p327
aVbut they take some nourishment down from the databases,
p328
aVbut people put prices on them, stupid passwords and boring statistics.
p329
aa(lp330
V(Laughter)
p331
aa(lp332
VAnd this won't work.
p333
aa(lp334
V(Applause)
p335
aa(lp336
VSo what is needed? We have the databases.
p337
aVIt's not the new database you need.
p338
aVWe have wonderful design tools, and more and more are added up here.
p339
aVSo we started a nonprofit venture
p340
aVwhich, linking data to design, we called Gapminder,
p341
aVfrom the London Underground,
p342
aVwhere they warn you, "mind the gap."
p343
aVSo we thought Gapminder was appropriate.
p344
aVAnd we started to write software which could link the data like this.
p345
aVAnd it wasn't that difficult.
p346
aVIt took some person years, and we have produced animations.
p347
aVYou can take a data set and put it there.
p348
aVWe are liberating U.N. data, some few U.N. organization.
p349
aa(lp350
VSome countries accept that their databases can go out on the world,
p351
aVbut what we really need is, of course, a search function.
p352
aVA search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format
p353
aVand get it out in the world.
p354
aVAnd what do we hear when we go around?
p355
aVI've done anthropology on the main statistical units.
p356
aVEveryone says, "It's impossible. This can't be done.
p357
aVOur information is so peculiar in detail,
p358
aVso that cannot be searched as others can be searched.
p359
aVWe cannot give the data free to the students,
p360
aVfree to the entrepreneurs of the world."
p361
aa(lp362
VBut this is what we would like to see, isn't it?
p363
aVThe publicly-funded data is down here.
p364
aVAnd we would like flowers to grow out on the Net.
p365
aVAnd one of the crucial points is to make them searchable,
p366
aVand then people can use the different design tool to animate it there.
p367
aVAnd I have pretty good news for you.
p368
aVI have good news that the present,
p369
aVnew Head of U.N. Statistics, he doesn't say it's impossible.
p370
aVHe only says, "We can't do it."
p371
aa(lp372
V(Laughter)
p373
aa(lp374
VAnd that's a quite clever guy, huh?
p375
aa(lp376
V(Laughter)
p377
aa(lp378
VSo we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years.
p379
aVWe will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways.
p380
aVThis is the income distribution of China, 1970.
p381
aVThis is the income distribution of the United States, 1970.
p382
aVAlmost no overlap.
p383
aVAnd what has happened?
p384
aVWhat has happened is this:
p385
aVthat China is growing, it's not so equal any longer,
p386
aVand it's appearing here, overlooking the United States.
p387
aVAlmost like a ghost, isn't it?
p388
aa(lp389
V(Laughter)
p390
aa(lp391
VIt's pretty scary.
p392
aa(lp393
V(Laughter)
p394
aa(lp395
VBut I think it's very important to have all this information.
p396
aVWe need really to see it.
p397
aVAnd instead of looking at this,
p398
aVI would like to end up by showing the Internet users per 1,000.
p399
aVIn this software, we access about 500 variables
p400
aVfrom all the countries quite easily.
p401
aVIt takes some time to change for this,
p402
aVbut on the axises, you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have.
p403
aVAnd the thing would be to get up the databases free,
p404
aVto get them searchable, and with a second click,
p405
aVto get them into the graphic formats, where you can instantly understand them.
p406
aVNow, statisticians don't like it,
p407
aVbecause they say that this will not show the reality;
p408
aVwe have to have statistical, analytical methods.
p409
aVBut this is hypothesis-generating.
p410
aa(lp411
VI end now with the world.
p412
aVThere, the Internet is coming.
p413
aVThe number of Internet users are going up like this.
p414
aVThis is the GDP per capita.
p415
aVAnd it's a new technology coming in, but then amazingly,
p416
aVhow well it fits to the economy of the countries.
p417
aVThat's why the $100 computer will be so important.
p418
aVBut it's a nice tendency.
p419
aVIt's as if the world is flattening off, isn't it?
p420
aVThese countries are lifting more than the economy
p421
aVand will be very interesting to follow this over the year,
p422
aVas I would like you to be able to do with all the publicly funded data.
p423
aa(lp424
VThank you very much.
p425
aa(lp426

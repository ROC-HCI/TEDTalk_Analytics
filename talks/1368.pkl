VHow can I speak in 10 minutes
p5
aVabout the bonds of women over three generations,
p6
aVabout how the astonishing strength of those bonds
p7
aVtook hold in the life of a four-year-old girl
p8
aVhuddled with her young sister, her mother and her grandmother
p9
aVfor five days and nights in a small boat in the China Sea
p10
aVmore than 30 years ago.
p11
aVBonds that took hold in the life of that small girl
p12
aVand never let go \u2014
p13
aVthat small girl now living in San Francisco
p14
aVand speaking to you today.
p15
aVThis is not a finished story.
p16
aVIt is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together.
p17
aVLet me tell you about some of the pieces.
p18
aa(lp19
VImagine the first piece: a man burning his life's work.
p20
aVHe is a poet, a playwright,
p21
aVa man whose whole life
p22
aVhad been balanced on the single hope of his country's unity and freedom.
p23
aVImagine him as the communists enter Saigon \u2014
p24
aVconfronting the fact that his life had been a complete waste.
p25
aVWords, for so long his friends, now mocked him.
p26
aVHe retreated into silence.
p27
aVHe died broken by history.
p28
aVHe is my grandfather.
p29
aVI never knew him in real life.
p30
aVBut our lives are much more than our memories.
p31
aVMy grandmother never let me forget his life.
p32
aVMy duty was not to allow it to have been in vain,
p33
aVand my lesson was to learn that, yes, history tried to crush us,
p34
aVbut we endured.
p35
aa(lp36
VThe next piece of the jigsaw is of a boat in the early dawn
p37
aVslipping silently out to sea.
p38
aVMy mother, Mai, was 18 when her father died \u2014
p39
aValready in an arranged marriage,
p40
aValready with two small girls.
p41
aVFor her, life had distilled itself into one task:
p42
aVthe escape of her family and a new life in Australia.
p43
aVIt was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed.
p44
aVSo after a four-year saga that defies fiction,
p45
aVa boat slipped out to sea disguised as a fishing vessel.
p46
aVAll the adults knew the risks.
p47
aVThe greatest fear was of pirates, rape and death.
p48
aVLike most adults on the boat,
p49
aVmy mother carried a small bottle of poison.
p50
aVIf we were captured, first my sister and I,
p51
aVthen she and my grandmother would drink.
p52
aa(lp53
VMy first memories are from the boat \u2014
p54
aVthe steady beat of the engine,
p55
aVthe bow dipping into each wave,
p56
aVthe vast and empty horizon.
p57
aVI don't remember the pirates who came many times,
p58
aVbut were bluffed by the bravado of the men on our boat,
p59
aVor the engine dying and failing to start for six hours.
p60
aVBut I do remember the lights on the oil rig off the Malaysian coast
p61
aVand the young man who collapsed and died,
p62
aVthe journey's end too much for him,
p63
aVand the first apple I tasted, given to me by the men on the rig.
p64
aVNo apple has ever tasted the same.
p65
aa(lp66
VAfter three months in a refugee camp, we landed in Melbourne.
p67
aVAnd the next piece of the jigsaw is about four women
p68
aVacross three generations shaping a new life together.
p69
aVWe settled in Footscray,
p70
aVa working-class suburb whose demographic is layers of immigrants.
p71
aVUnlike the settled middle-class suburbs, whose existence I was oblivious of,
p72
aVthere was no sense of entitlement in Footscray.
p73
aVThe smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world.
p74
aVAnd the snippets of halting English
p75
aVwere exchanged between people who had one thing in common:
p76
aVThey were starting again.
p77
aa(lp78
VMy mother worked on farms,
p79
aVthen on a car assembly line,
p80
aVworking six days, double shifts.
p81
aVSomehow, she found time to study English
p82
aVand gain IT qualifications.
p83
aVWe were poor.
p84
aVAll the dollars were allocated
p85
aVand extra tuition in English and mathematics was budgeted for
p86
aVregardless of what missed out,
p87
aVwhich was usually new clothes;
p88
aVthey were always secondhand.
p89
aVTwo pairs of stockings for school,
p90
aVeach to hide the holes in the other.
p91
aVA school uniform down to the ankles, because it had to last for six years.
p92
aVAnd there were rare but searing chants of "slit-eye"
p93
aVand the occasional graffiti:
p94
aV"Asian, go home."
p95
aVGo home to where?
p96
aVSomething stiffened inside me.
p97
aVThere was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying,
p98
aV"I will bypass you."
p99
aa(lp100
VMy mother, my sister and I slept in the same bed.
p101
aVMy mother was exhausted each night,
p102
aVbut we told one another about our day
p103
aVand listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house.
p104
aVMy mother suffered from nightmares, all about the boat.
p105
aVAnd my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came
p106
aVso I could wake her.
p107
aVShe opened a computer store,
p108
aVthen studied to be a beautician and opened another business.
p109
aVAnd the women came with their stories
p110
aVabout men who could not make the transition,
p111
aVangry and inflexible,
p112
aVand troubled children caught between two worlds.
p113
aa(lp114
VGrants and sponsors were sought.
p115
aVCenters were established.
p116
aVI lived in parallel worlds.
p117
aVIn one, I was the classic Asian student,
p118
aVrelentless in the demands that I made on myself.
p119
aVIn the other, I was enmeshed in lives that were precarious,
p120
aVtragically scarred by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
p121
aVBut so many over the years were helped.
p122
aVAnd for that work, when I was a final-year law student,
p123
aVI was chosen as the Young Australian of the Year.
p124
aVAnd I was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another,
p125
aVand their edges didn't fit.
p126
aa(lp127
VTan Le, anonymous Footscray resident,
p128
aVwas now Tan Le, refugee and social activist,
p129
aVinvited to speak in venues she had never heard of
p130
aVand into homes whose existence she could never have imagined.
p131
aVI didn't know the protocols.
p132
aVI didn't know how to use the cutlery.
p133
aVI didn't know how to talk about wine.
p134
aVI didn't know how to talk about anything.
p135
aVI wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort
p136
aVof life in an unsung suburb \u2014
p137
aVa grandmother, a mother and two daughters
p138
aVending each day as they had for almost 20 years,
p139
aVtelling one another the story of their day
p140
aVand falling asleep, the three of us still in the same bed.
p141
aVI told my mother I couldn't do it.
p142
aVShe reminded me that I was now the same age she had been
p143
aVwhen we boarded the boat.
p144
aV"No" had never been an option.
p145
aV"Just do it," she said,
p146
aV"and don't be what you're not."
p147
aa(lp148
VSo I spoke out on youth unemployment and education
p149
aVand the neglect of the marginalized and disenfranchised.
p150
aVAnd the more candidly I spoke, the more I was asked to speak.
p151
aVI met people from all walks of life,
p152
aVso many of them doing the thing they loved,
p153
aVliving on the frontiers of possibility.
p154
aVAnd even though I finished my degree,
p155
aVI realized I could not settle into a career in law.
p156
aVThere had to be another piece of the jigsaw.
p157
aVAnd I realized, at the same time,
p158
aVthat it is OK to be an outsider,
p159
aVa recent arrival,
p160
aVnew on the scene \u2014
p161
aVand not just OK,
p162
aVbut something to be thankful for,
p163
aVperhaps a gift from the boat.
p164
aVBecause being an insider can so easily mean collapsing the horizons,
p165
aVcan so easily mean accepting the presumptions of your province.
p166
aVI have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now
p167
aVto know that, yes, the world does fall apart,
p168
aVbut not in the way that you fear.
p169
aa(lp170
VPossibilities that would not have been allowed
p171
aVwere outrageously encouraged.
p172
aVThere was an energy there,
p173
aVan implacable optimism,
p174
aVa strange mixture of humility and daring.
p175
aVSo I followed my hunches.
p176
aVI gathered around me a small team of people
p177
aVfor whom the label "It can't be done" was an irresistible challenge.
p178
aVFor a year, we were penniless.
p179
aVAt the end of each day, I made a huge pot of soup
p180
aVwhich we all shared.
p181
aVWe worked well into each night.
p182
aVMost of our ideas were crazy,
p183
aVbut a few were brilliant,
p184
aVand we broke through.
p185
aVI made the decision to move to the US after only one trip.
p186
aVMy hunches again.
p187
aVThree months later, I had relocated, and the adventure has continued.
p188
aa(lp189
VBefore I close, though, let me tell you about my grandmother.
p190
aVShe grew up at a time when Confucianism was the social norm
p191
aVand the local mandarin was the person who mattered.
p192
aVLife hadn't changed for centuries.
p193
aVHer father died soon after she was born.
p194
aVHer mother raised her alone.
p195
aVAt 17, she became the second wife of a mandarin whose mother beat her.
p196
aVWith no support from her husband,
p197
aVshe caused a sensation by taking him to court
p198
aVand prosecuting her own case,
p199
aVand a far greater sensation when she won.
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
V(Applause)
p204
aa(lp205
V"It can't be done" was shown to be wrong.
p206
aa(lp207
VI was taking a shower in a hotel room in Sydney
p208
aVthe moment she died,
p209
aV600 miles away, in Melbourne.
p210
aVI looked through the shower screen and saw her standing on the other side.
p211
aVI knew she had come to say goodbye.
p212
aVMy mother phoned minutes later.
p213
aVA few days later,
p214
aVwe went to a Buddhist temple in Footscray and sat around her casket.
p215
aVWe told her stories and assured her that we were still with her.
p216
aVAt midnight, the monk came and told us he had to close the casket.
p217
aVMy mother asked us to feel her hand.
p218
aVShe asked the monk,
p219
aV"Why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold?"
p220
aV"Because you have been holding it since this morning," he said.
p221
aV"You have not let it go."
p222
aa(lp223
VIf there is a sinew in our family, it runs through the women.
p224
aVGiven who we were and how life had shaped us,
p225
aVwe can now see that the men that might have come into our lives
p226
aVwould have thwarted us.
p227
aVDefeat would have come too easily.
p228
aVNow I would like to have my own children, and I wonder about the boat.
p229
aVWho could ever wish it on their own?
p230
aVYet I am afraid of privilege,
p231
aVof ease,
p232
aVof entitlement.
p233
aVCan I give them a bow in their lives, dipping bravely into each wave,
p234
aVthe unperturbed and steady beat of the engine,
p235
aVthe vast horizon that guarantees nothing?
p236
aVI don't know.
p237
aVBut if I could give it
p238
aVand still see them safely through,
p239
aVI would.
p240
aa(lp241
V(Applause)
p242
aa(lp243
VTrevor Neilson: And also, Tan's mother is here today,
p244
aVin the fourth or fifth row.

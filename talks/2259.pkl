VSo I grew up in Orlando, Florida.
p5
aVI was the son of an aerospace engineer.
p6
aVI lived and breathed the Apollo program.
p7
aVWe either saw the launches from our backyard
p8
aVor we saw it by driving in the hour over to the Cape.
p9
aVI was impressed by, obviously, space and everything about it,
p10
aVbut I was most impressed by the engineering that went into it.
p11
aa(lp12
VBehind me you see an amazing view,
p13
aVa picture that was taken from the International Space Station,
p14
aVand it shows a portion of our planet
p15
aVthat's rarely seen and rarely studied
p16
aVand almost never explored.
p17
aVThat place is called the stratosphere.
p18
aa(lp19
VIf you start on the planet and you go up and up and up,
p20
aVit gets colder and colder and colder,
p21
aVuntil you reach the beginning of the stratosphere,
p22
aVand then an amazing thing happens.
p23
aVIt gets colder at a much slower rate, and then it starts warming up,
p24
aVand then it gets warmer and warmer
p25
aVuntil the point where you can almost survive without any protection,
p26
aVabout zero degrees,
p27
aVand then you end up getting colder and colder,
p28
aVand that's the top of the stratosphere.
p29
aVIt is one of the least accessible places on our planet.
p30
aVMost often, when it's visited,
p31
aVit's by astronauts who are blazing up at it
p32
aVat probably several times the speed of sound,
p33
aVand they get a few seconds on the way up,
p34
aVand then they get this blazing ball of fire coming back in,
p35
aVon the way back in.
p36
aa(lp37
VBut the question I asked is, is it possible to linger in the stratosphere?
p38
aVIs it possible to experience the stratosphere?
p39
aVIs it possible to explore the stratosphere?
p40
aa(lp41
VI studied this using my favorite search engine
p42
aVfor quite a while, about a year,
p43
aVand then I made a scary phone call.
p44
aVIt was a reference from a friend of mine to call Taber MacCallum
p45
aVfrom Paragon Space Development Corporation,
p46
aVand I asked him the question:
p47
aVis it possible to build
p48
aVa system to go into the stratosphere?
p49
aVAnd he said it was.
p50
aVAnd after a period of about three years, we proceeded to do just that.
p51
aVAnd on October 24 of last year,
p52
aVin this suit,
p53
aVI started on the ground,
p54
aVI went up in a balloon to 135,890 feet \u2014
p55
aVbut who's counting?
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VCame back to Earth at speeds of up to 822 miles an hour.
p60
aVIt was a four-minute and 27-second descent.
p61
aVAnd when I got to 10,000 feet, I opened a parachute and I landed.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Applause)
p64
aa(lp65
VBut this is really a science talk, and it's really an engineering talk,
p66
aVand what was amazing to me about that experience
p67
aVis that Taber said, yes, I think we can build a stratospheric suit,
p68
aVand more than that, come down tomorrow
p69
aVand let's talk to the team that formed the core of the group
p70
aVthat actually built it.
p71
aVAnd they did something which I think is important,
p72
aVwhich is they took the analogy of scuba diving.
p73
aVSo in scuba diving,
p74
aVyou have a self-contained system.
p75
aVYou have everything that you could ever need.
p76
aVYou have a scuba tank.
p77
aVYou have a wetsuit.
p78
aVYou have visibility.
p79
aVAnd that scuba is exactly this system,
p80
aVand we're going to launch it into the stratosphere.
p81
aa(lp82
VThree years later, this is what we have.
p83
aVWe've got an amazing suit that was made by ILC Dover.
p84
aVILC Dover was the company that made all of the Apollo suits
p85
aVand all of the extravehicular activity suits.
p86
aVThey had never sold a suit commercially,
p87
aVonly to the government,
p88
aVbut they sold one to me, which I am very grateful for.
p89
aVUp here we have a parachute. This was all about safety.
p90
aVEveryone on the team knew
p91
aVthat I have a wife and two small children \u2014
p92
aV10 and 15 \u2014
p93
aVand I wanted to come back safely.
p94
aVSo there's a main parachute and a reserve parachute,
p95
aVand if I do nothing,
p96
aVthe reserve parachute is going to open because of an automatic opening device.
p97
aVThe suit itself can protect me from the cold.
p98
aVThis area in the front here has thermal protection.
p99
aVIt will actually heat water that will wrap around my body.
p100
aVIt has two redundant oxygen tanks.
p101
aVEven if I was to get a quarter-inch hole in this suit,
p102
aVwhich is extremely unlikely,
p103
aVthis system would still protect me from the low pressure of space.
p104
aa(lp105
VThe main advantage of this system is weight and complexity.
p106
aVSo the system weighs about 500 pounds,
p107
aVand if you compare it to the other attempt recently to go up in the stratosphere,
p108
aVthey used a capsule.
p109
aVAnd to do a capsule, there's an amazing amount of complexity that goes into it,
p110
aVand it weighed about 3,000 pounds,
p111
aVand to raise 3,000 pounds to an altitude of 135,000 feet,
p112
aVwhich was my target altitude,
p113
aVit would have taken a balloon that was 45 to 50 million cubic feet.
p114
aVBecause I only weighed 500 pounds in this system,
p115
aVwe could do it with a balloon that was five times smaller than that,
p116
aVand that allowed us to use a launch system that was dramatically simpler
p117
aVthan what needs to be done for a much larger balloon.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo with that, I want to take you to Roswell, New Mexico, on October 24.
p120
aVWe had an amazing team that got up in the middle of the night.
p121
aVAnd here's the suit.
p122
aVAgain, this is using the front loader that you'll see in a second,
p123
aVand I want to play you a video of the actual launch.
p124
aVRoswell's a great place to launch balloons,
p125
aVbut it's a fantastic place to land under a parachute,
p126
aVespecially when you're going to land 70 miles away from the place you started.
p127
aVThat's a helium truck in the background.
p128
aVIt's darkness.
p129
aVI've already spent about an hour and a half pre-breathing.
p130
aVAnd then here you see the suit going on.
p131
aVIt takes about an hour to get the suit on.
p132
aVAstronauts get this really nice air-conditioned van
p133
aVto go to the launch pad, but I got a front loader.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VYou can see the top. You can see the balloon up there.
p138
aVThat's where the helium is.
p139
aVThis is Dave clearing the airspace with the FAA for 15 miles.
p140
aVAnd there we go.
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VThat's me waving with my left hand.
p145
aVThe reason I'm waving with my left hand
p146
aVis because on the right hand is the emergency cutaway.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VMy team forbade me from using my right hand.
p151
aVSo the trip up is beautiful. It's kind of like Google Earth in reverse.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VIt took two hours and seven minutes to go up,
p156
aVand it was the most peaceful two hours and seven minutes.
p157
aVI was mostly trying to relax.
p158
aVMy heart rate was very low
p159
aVand I was trying not to use very much oxygen.
p160
aVYou can see how the fields in the background
p161
aVare relatively big at this point,
p162
aVand you can see me going up and up.
p163
aa(lp164
VIt's interesting here, because if you look,
p165
aVI'm right over the airport, and I'm probably at 50,000 feet,
p166
aVbut immediately I'm about to go into a stratospheric wind
p167
aVof over 120 miles an hour.
p168
aVThis is my flight director telling me that I had just gone higher
p169
aVthan anybody else had ever gone in a balloon,
p170
aVand I was about 4,000 feet from release.
p171
aVThis is what it looks like.
p172
aVYou can see the darkness of space, the curvature of the Earth,
p173
aVthe fragile planet below.
p174
aVI'm practicing my emergency procedures mentally right now.
p175
aVIf anything goes wrong, I want to be ready.
p176
aVAnd the main thing that I want to do here
p177
aVis to have a release and fall and stay completely stable.
p178
aa(lp179
V(Video) Ground control. Everyone ready?
p180
aVFive. Four. Three. Two. One.
p181
aa(lp182
VAlan Eustace: There's the balloon going by, fully inflated at this point.
p183
aVAnd there you can see a drogue parachute, which I'll demonstrate in just a second,
p184
aVbecause that's really important.
p185
aVThere's the balloon going by a second time.
p186
aVRight now, I'm about at the speed of sound.
p187
aVThere's nothing for me to tell it's the speed of sound,
p188
aVand very soon I will actually be as fast as I ever get,
p189
aV822 miles an hour.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Video) Ground control: We lost the data.
p192
aa(lp193
VAE: So now I'm down low right now
p194
aVand you can basically see the parachute come out right there.
p195
aVAt this point, I'm very happy that there's a parachute out.
p196
aVI thought I was the only one happy,
p197
aVbut it turns out mission control was really happy as well.
p198
aVThe really nice thing about this is the moment I opened \u2014
p199
aVI had a close of friend of mine, Blikkies, my parachute guy.
p200
aVHe flew in another airplane, and he actually jumped out
p201
aVand landed right next to me.
p202
aVHe was my wingman on the descent.
p203
aVThis is my landing, but it's probably more properly called a crash.
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VI hate to admit it, but this wasn't even close to my worst landing.
p208
aa(lp209
V(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
V(Applause)
p212
aa(lp213
V(Video) Man: How are you doing?
p214
aa(lp215
VAE: Hi there!
p216
aVYay.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VSo I want to tell you one thing
p221
aVthat you might not have seen in that video,
p222
aVbut one of the most critical parts of the entire thing was the release
p223
aVand what happens right after you release.
p224
aVAnd what we tried to do was use something called a drogue parachute,
p225
aVand a drogue parachute was there to stabilize me.
p226
aVAnd I'll show you one of those right now.
p227
aVIf any of you have ever gone tandem skydiving,
p228
aVyou probably used one of these.
p229
aVBut the problem with one of these things
p230
aVis right when you release, you're in zero gravity.
p231
aVSo it's very easy for this to just turn right around you.
p232
aVAnd before you know it, you can be tangled up or spinning,
p233
aVor you can release this drogue late,
p234
aVin which case what happens is you're going down at 800 miles an hour,
p235
aVand this thing is going to destroy itself
p236
aVand not be very useful.
p237
aVBut the guys at United Parachute Technologies came up with this idea,
p238
aVand it was a roll that looks like that,
p239
aVbut watch what happens when I pull it out.
p240
aVIt's forming a pipe.
p241
aVThis pipe is so solid
p242
aVthat you can take this drogue parachute and wrap it around,
p243
aVand there's no way it will ever tangle with you.
p244
aVAnd that prevented a very serious potential problem.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo nothing is possible without an amazing team of people.
p247
aVThe core of this was about 20 people
p248
aVthat worked on this for the three years,
p249
aVand they were incredible.
p250
aVPeople asked me what the best part of this whole thing was,
p251
aVand it was a chance to work with the best experts
p252
aVin meteorology and ballooning and parachute technology
p253
aVand environmental systems and high altitude medicine.
p254
aVIt was fantastic. It's an engineer's dream to work with that group of people.
p255
aVAnd I also at the same time wanted to thank my friends at Google,
p256
aVboth for supporting me during this effort
p257
aVand also covering for me in the times that I was away.
p258
aVBut there's one other group I wanted to thank, and that's my family.
p259
aVYay.
p260
aa(lp261
V(Applause)
p262
aa(lp263
VI would constantly give them speeches about the safety of technology,
p264
aVand they weren't hearing any of it.
p265
aVIt was super hard on them,
p266
aVand the only reason that my wife put up with it
p267
aVwas because I came back incredibly happy after each of the 250 tests,
p268
aVand she didn't want to take that away from me.
p269
aVSo I want to close with a story.
p270
aVMy daughter Katelyn, my 15-year-old, she and I were in the car,
p271
aVand we were driving down the road, and she was sitting there,
p272
aVand she had this idea, and she goes, "Dad, I've got this idea."
p273
aVAnd so I listened to her idea and I said, "Katelyn, that's impossible."
p274
aVAnd she looks at me
p275
aVand she goes, "Dad, after what you just did,
p276
aVhow can you call anything impossible?"
p277
aVAnd I laughed, and I said, "OK, it's not impossible,
p278
aVit's just very, very hard."
p279
aVAnd then I paused for a second, and I said, "Katelyn,
p280
aVit may not be impossible, it may not even be very, very hard,
p281
aVit's just that I don't know how to do it."
p282
aa(lp283
VThank you.
p284
aa(lp285
V(Applause)

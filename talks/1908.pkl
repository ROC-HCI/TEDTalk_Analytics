VMy job is to design, build and study robots that communicate with people.
p5
aVBut this story doesn't start with robotics at all, it starts with animation.
p6
aVWhen I first saw Pixar's "Luxo Jr.,"
p7
aVI was amazed by how much emotion they could put
p8
aVinto something as trivial as a desk lamp.
p9
aVI mean, look at them \u2014 at the end of this movie,
p10
aVyou actually feel something for two pieces of furniture.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd I said, I have to learn how to do this.
p15
aVSo I made a really bad career decision.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd that's what my mom was like when I did it.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VI left a very cozy tech job in Israel at a nice software company
p24
aVand I moved to New York to study animation.
p25
aVAnd there I lived
p26
aVin a collapsing apartment building in Harlem with roommates.
p27
aVI'm not using this phrase metaphorically \u2014
p28
aVthe ceiling actually collapsed one day in our living room.
p29
aVWhenever they did news stories about building violations in New York,
p30
aVthey would put the report in front of our building,
p31
aVas kind of, like, a backdrop to show how bad things are.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnyway, during the day, I went to school
p34
aVand at night I would sit and draw frame by frame of pencil animation.
p35
aVAnd I learned two surprising lessons.
p36
aVOne of them was that when you want to arouse emotions,
p37
aVit doesn't matter so much how something looks;
p38
aVit's all in the motion, in the timing of how the thing moves.
p39
aVAnd the second was something one of our teachers told us.
p40
aVHe actually did the weasel in "Ice Age."
p41
aVAnd he said, "As an animator, you're not a director \u2014 you're an actor."
p42
aVSo, if you want to find the right motion for a character,
p43
aVdon't think about it \u2014 go use your body to find it.
p44
aVStand in front of a mirror, act it out in front of a camera \u2014
p45
aVwhatever you need \u2014 and then put it back in your character.
p46
aa(lp47
VA year later I found myself at MIT in the Robotic Life Group.
p48
aVIt was one of the first groups researching the relationships
p49
aVbetween humans and robots.
p50
aVAnd I still had this dream to make an actual, physical Luxo Jr. lamp.
p51
aVBut I found that robots didn't move at all in this engaging way
p52
aVthat I was used to from my animation studies.
p53
aVInstead, they were all \u2014 how should I put it \u2014
p54
aVthey were all kind of robotic.
p55
aV(Laughter)
p56
aVAnd I thought, what if I took whatever I learned in animation school,
p57
aVand used that to design my robotic desk lamp.
p58
aVSo I went and designed frame by frame
p59
aVto try to make this robot as graceful and engaging as possible.
p60
aVAnd here when you see the robot interacting with me on a desktop \u2014
p61
aVand I'm actually redesigning the robot,
p62
aVso, unbeknownst to itself,
p63
aVit's kind of digging its own grave by helping me.
p64
aa(lp65
V(Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
VI wanted it to be less of a mechanical structure giving me light,
p68
aVand more of a helpful, kind of quiet apprentice
p69
aVthat's always there when you need it and doesn't really interfere.
p70
aVAnd when, for example, I'm looking for a battery that I can't find,
p71
aVin a subtle way, it'll show me where the battery is.
p72
aVSo you can see my confusion here.
p73
aVI'm not an actor.
p74
aVAnd I want you to notice how the same mechanical structure
p75
aVcan, at one point, just by the way it moves,
p76
aVseem gentle and caring and in the other case,
p77
aVseem violent and confrontational.
p78
aVAnd it's the same structure, just the motion is different.
p79
aVActor: "You want to know something? Well, you want to know something?
p80
aVHe was already dead!
p81
aVJust laying there, eyes glazed over!"
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
VBut, moving in a graceful way is just one building block
p86
aVof this whole structure called human-robot interaction.
p87
aVI was, at the time, doing my PhD, I was working on human-robot teamwork,
p88
aVteams of humans and robots working together.
p89
aVI was studying the engineering,
p90
aVthe psychology, the philosophy of teamwork,
p91
aVand at the same time,
p92
aVI found myself in my own kind of teamwork situation,
p93
aVwith a good friend of mine, who's actually here.
p94
aVAnd in that situation, we can easily imagine robots
p95
aVin the near future being there with us.
p96
aVIt was after a Passover Seder.
p97
aVWe were folding up a lot of folding chairs,
p98
aVand I was amazed at how quickly we found our own rhythm.
p99
aVEverybody did their own part, we didn't have to divide our tasks.
p100
aVWe didn't have to communicate verbally about this \u2014
p101
aVit all just happened.
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd I thought, humans and robots don't look at all like this.
p104
aVWhen humans and robots interact, it's much more like a chess game:
p105
aVthe human does a thing, the robot analyzes whatever the human did,
p106
aVthe robot decides what to do next, plans it and does it.
p107
aVThen the human waits, until it's their turn again.
p108
aVSo it's much more like a chess game, and that makes sense,
p109
aVbecause chess is great for mathematicians and computer scientists.
p110
aVIt's all about information, analysis, decision-making and planning.
p111
aa(lp112
VBut I wanted my robot to be less of a chess player,
p113
aVand more like a doer
p114
aVthat just clicks and works together.
p115
aVSo I made my second horrible career choice:
p116
aVI decided to study acting for a semester.
p117
aVI took off from the PhD, I went to acting classes.
p118
aVI actually participated in a play \u2014
p119
aVI hope there\u2019s no video of that around still.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd I got every book I could find about acting,
p124
aVincluding one from the 19th century that I got from the library.
p125
aVAnd I was really amazed, because my name was the second name on the list \u2014
p126
aVthe previous name was in 1889.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd this book was kind of waiting for 100 years
p131
aVto be rediscovered for robotics.
p132
aVAnd this book shows actors
p133
aVhow to move every muscle in the body
p134
aVto match every kind of emotion that they want to express.
p135
aa(lp136
VBut the real revelation was when I learned about method acting.
p137
aVIt became very popular in the 20th century.
p138
aVAnd method acting said
p139
aVyou don't have to plan every muscle in your body;
p140
aVinstead, you have to use your body to find the right movement.
p141
aVYou have to use your sense memory to reconstruct the emotions
p142
aVand kind of think with your body to find the right expression \u2014
p143
aVimprovise, play off your scene partner.
p144
aVAnd this came at the same time
p145
aVas I was reading about this trend in cognitive psychology,
p146
aVcalled embodied cognition, which also talks about the same ideas.
p147
aVWe use our bodies to think;
p148
aVwe don't just think with our brains and use our bodies to move,
p149
aVbut our bodies feed back into our brain
p150
aVto generate the way that we behave.
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd it was like a lightning bolt.
p153
aVI went back to my office,
p154
aVI wrote this paper, which I never really published,
p155
aVcalled "Acting Lessons for Artificial Intelligence."
p156
aVAnd I even took another month
p157
aVto do what was then the first theater play
p158
aVwith a human and a robot acting together.
p159
aVThat's what you saw before with the actors.
p160
aVAnd I thought:
p161
aVHow can we make an artificial intelligence model \u2014
p162
aVa computer, computational model \u2014
p163
aVthat will model some of these ideas of improvisation,
p164
aVof taking risks, of taking chances,
p165
aVeven of making mistakes?
p166
aVMaybe it can make for better robotic teammates.
p167
aVSo I worked for quite a long time on these models
p168
aVand I implemented them on a number of robots.
p169
aa(lp170
VHere you can see a very early example
p171
aVwith the robots trying to use this embodied artificial intelligence
p172
aVto try to match my movements as closely as possible.
p173
aVIt's sort of like a game.
p174
aVLet's look at it.
p175
aVYou can see when I psych it out, it gets fooled.
p176
aVAnd it's a little bit like what you might see actors do
p177
aVwhen they try to mirror each other
p178
aVto find the right synchrony between them.
p179
aVAnd then, I did another experiment,
p180
aVand I got people off the street to use the robotic desk lamp,
p181
aVand try out this idea of embodied artificial intelligence.
p182
aVSo, I actually used two kinds of brains for the same robot.
p183
aa(lp184
VThe robot is the same lamp that you saw,
p185
aVand I put two brains in it.
p186
aVFor one half of the people,
p187
aVI put in a brain that's kind of the traditional,
p188
aVcalculated robotic brain.
p189
aVIt waits for its turn, it analyzes everything, it plans.
p190
aVLet's call it the calculated brain.
p191
aVThe other got more the stage actor, risk-taker brain.
p192
aVLet's call it the adventurous brain.
p193
aVIt sometimes acts without knowing everything it has to know.
p194
aVIt sometimes makes mistakes and corrects them.
p195
aVAnd I had them do this very tedious task that took almost 20 minutes,
p196
aVand they had to work together,
p197
aVsomehow simulating, like, a factory job
p198
aVof repetitively doing the same thing.
p199
aVWhat I found is that people actually loved the adventurous robot.
p200
aVThey thought it was more intelligent,
p201
aVmore committed, a better member of the team,
p202
aVcontributed to the success of the team more.
p203
aVThey even called it "he" and "she,"
p204
aVwhereas people with the calculated brain
p205
aVcalled it "it," and nobody ever called it "he" or "she."
p206
aVWhen they talked about it after the task, with the adventurous brain,
p207
aVthey said, "By the end, we were good friends and high-fived mentally."
p208
aVWhatever that means.
p209
aa(lp210
V(Laughter)
p211
aa(lp212
VSounds painful.
p213
aVWhereas the people with the calculated brain
p214
aVsaid it was just like a lazy apprentice.
p215
aVIt only did what it was supposed to do and nothing more,
p216
aVwhich is almost what people expect robots to do,
p217
aVso I was surprised that people had higher expectations of robots
p218
aVthan what anybody in robotics thought robots should be doing.
p219
aVAnd in a way, I thought, maybe it's time \u2014
p220
aVjust like method acting changed the way people thought
p221
aVabout acting in the 19th century,
p222
aVfrom going from the very calculated, planned way of behaving,
p223
aVto a more intuitive, risk-taking, embodied way of behaving \u2014
p224
aVmaybe it's time for robots to have the same kind of revolution.
p225
aa(lp226
VA few years later, I was at my next research job at Georgia Tech in Atlanta,
p227
aVand I was working in a group dealing with robotic musicians.
p228
aVAnd I thought, music: that's the perfect place
p229
aVto look at teamwork, coordination, timing, improvisation \u2014
p230
aVand we just got this robot playing marimba.
p231
aVAnd the marimba, for everybody like me,
p232
aVit was this huge, wooden xylophone.
p233
aVAnd when I was looking at this,
p234
aVI looked at other works in human-robot improvisation \u2014
p235
aVyes, there are other works in human-robot improvisation \u2014
p236
aVand they were also a little bit like a chess game.
p237
aVThe human would play,
p238
aVthe robot analyzed what was played,
p239
aVand would improvise their own part.
p240
aVSo, this is what musicians called a call-and-response interaction,
p241
aVand it also fits very well robots and artificial intelligence.
p242
aVBut I thought, if I use the same ideas I used in the theater play
p243
aVand in the teamwork studies,
p244
aVmaybe I can make the robots jam together like a band.
p245
aVEverybody's riffing off each other, nobody is stopping for a moment.
p246
aVAnd so I tried to do the same things, this time with music,
p247
aVwhere the robot doesn't really know what it's about to play,
p248
aVit just sort of moves its body and uses opportunities to play,
p249
aVand does what my jazz teacher when I was 17 taught me.
p250
aVShe said, when you improvise,
p251
aVsometimes you don't know what you're doing, and you still do it.
p252
aVSo I tried to make a robot that doesn't actually know what it's doing,
p253
aVbut is still doing it.
p254
aVSo let's look at a few seconds from this performance,
p255
aVwhere the robot listens to the human musician
p256
aVand improvises.
p257
aVAnd then, look how the human musician also responds
p258
aVto what the robot is doing
p259
aVand picking up from its behavior,
p260
aVand at some point can even be surprised by what the robot came up with.
p261
aa(lp262
V(Music)
p263
aa(lp264
V(Music ends)
p265
aa(lp266
V(Applause)
p267
aa(lp268
VBeing a musician is not just about making notes,
p269
aVotherwise nobody would ever go see a live show.
p270
aVMusicians also communicate with their bodies,
p271
aVwith other band members, with the audience,
p272
aVthey use their bodies to express the music.
p273
aVAnd I thought, we already have a robot musician on stage,
p274
aVwhy not make it be a full-fledged musician?
p275
aVAnd I started designing a socially expressive head
p276
aVfor the robot.
p277
aVThe head doesn\u2019t actually touch the marimba,
p278
aVit just expresses what the music is like.
p279
aVThese are some napkin sketches from a bar in Atlanta
p280
aVthat was dangerously located exactly halfway
p281
aVbetween my lab and my home.
p282
aVSo I spent, I would say, on average, three to four hours a day there.
p283
aVI think.
p284
aa(lp285
V(Laughter)
p286
aa(lp287
VAnd I went back to my animation tools and tried to figure out
p288
aVnot just what a robotic musician would look like,
p289
aVbut especially what a robotic musician would move like,
p290
aVto sort of show that it doesn't like what the other person is playing \u2014
p291
aVand maybe show whatever beat it's feeling at the moment.
p292
aa(lp293
VSo we ended up actually getting the money to build this robot, which was nice.
p294
aVI'm going to show you now the same kind of performance,
p295
aVthis time with a socially expressive head.
p296
aVAnd notice one thing \u2014
p297
aVhow the robot is really showing us
p298
aVthe beat it's picking up from the human,
p299
aVwhile also giving the human a sense that the robot knows what it's doing.
p300
aVAnd also how it changes the way it moves
p301
aVas soon as it starts its own solo.
p302
aa(lp303
V(Music)
p304
aa(lp305
VNow it's looking at me, showing that it's listening.
p306
aa(lp307
V(Music)
p308
aa(lp309
VNow look at the final chord of the piece again.
p310
aVAnd this time the robot communicates with its body
p311
aVwhen it's busy doing its own thing,
p312
aVand when it's ready to coordinate the final chord with me.
p313
aa(lp314
V(Music)
p315
aa(lp316
V(Music ending)
p317
aa(lp318
V(Final chord)
p319
aa(lp320
V(Applause)
p321
aa(lp322
VThanks.
p323
aVI hope you see
p324
aVhow much this part of the body that doesn't touch the instrument
p325
aVactually helps with the musical performance.
p326
aVAnd at some point \u2014 we are in Atlanta,
p327
aVso obviously some rapper will come into our lab at some point \u2014
p328
aVand we had this rapper come in and do a little jam with the robot.
p329
aVHere you can see the robot basically responding to the beat.
p330
aVNotice two things:
p331
aVone, how irresistible it is to join the robot while it's moving its head.
p332
aVYou kind of want to move your own head when it does it.
p333
aVAnd second, even though the rapper is really focused on his iPhone,
p334
aVas soon as the robot turns to him, he turns back.
p335
aVSo even though it's just in the periphery of his vision,
p336
aVin the corner of his eye, it's very powerful.
p337
aVAnd the reason is that we can't ignore
p338
aVphysical things moving in our environment.
p339
aVWe are wired for that.
p340
aVSo if you have a problem \u2014
p341
aVmaybe your partner is looking at their iPhone or smartphone too much \u2014
p342
aVyou might want to have a robot there to get their attention.
p343
aa(lp344
V(Laughter)
p345
aa(lp346
V(Music)
p347
aa(lp348
V(Music ends)
p349
aa(lp350
V(Applause)
p351
aa(lp352
VJust to introduce the last robot that we've worked on,
p353
aVit came out of something surprising that we found:
p354
aVSome point people didn't care about the robot being intelligent,
p355
aVable to improvise and listen,
p356
aVand do all these embodied intelligence things that I spent years developing.
p357
aVThey really liked that the robot was enjoying the music.
p358
aa(lp359
V(Laughter)
p360
aa(lp361
VAnd they didn't say the robot was moving to the music,
p362
aVthey said "enjoying" the music.
p363
aVAnd we thought, why don't we take this idea,
p364
aVand I designed a new piece of furniture.
p365
aVThis time it wasn't a desk lamp, it was a speaker dock,
p366
aVone of those things you plug your smartphone in.
p367
aVAnd I thought,
p368
aVwhat would happen if your speaker dock didn't just play the music for you,
p369
aVbut would actually enjoy it, too?
p370
aVAnd so again, here are some animation tests from an early stage.
p371
aa(lp372
V(Laughter)
p373
aa(lp374
VAnd this is what the final product looked like.
p375
aa(lp376
V(Music)
p377
aa(lp378
V(Music ends)
p379
aa(lp380
VSo, a lot of bobbing heads.
p381
aa(lp382
V(Applause)
p383
aa(lp384
VA lot of bobbing heads in the audience,
p385
aVso we can still see robots influence people.
p386
aVAnd it's not just fun and games.
p387
aa(lp388
VI think one of the reasons I care so much
p389
aVabout robots that use their body to communicate
p390
aVand use their body to move is \u2014
p391
aVI'm going to let you in on a little secret we roboticists are hiding \u2014
p392
aVis that every one of you is going to be living with a robot
p393
aVat some point in your life.
p394
aVSomewhere in your future, there will be a robot in your life.
p395
aVIf not in yours, your children's lives.
p396
aVAnd I want these robots to be more fluent, more engaging, more graceful
p397
aVthan currently they seem to be.
p398
aVAnd for that I think maybe robots need to be less like chess players
p399
aVand more like stage actors and more like musicians.
p400
aVMaybe they should be able to take chances and improvise.
p401
aVMaybe they should be able to anticipate what you're about to do.
p402
aVMaybe they even need to be able to make mistakes and correct them,
p403
aVbecause in the end, we are human.
p404
aVAnd maybe as humans, robots that are a little less than perfect
p405
aVare just perfect for us.
p406
aa(lp407
VThank you.

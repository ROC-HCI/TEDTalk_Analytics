VThere is nothing bigger or older than the universe.
p5
aVThe questions I would like to talk about are:
p6
aVone, where did we come from?
p7
aVHow did the universe come into being?
p8
aVAre we alone in the universe?
p9
aVIs there alien life out there?
p10
aVWhat is the future of the human race?
p11
aa(lp12
VUp until the 1920s,
p13
aVeveryone thought the universe was essentially static
p14
aVand unchanging in time.
p15
aVThen it was discovered that the universe was expanding.
p16
aVDistant galaxies were moving away from us.
p17
aVThis meant they must have been closer together in the past.
p18
aVIf we extrapolate back,
p19
aVwe find we must have all been on top of each other
p20
aVabout 15 billion years ago.
p21
aVThis was the Big Bang, the beginning of the universe.
p22
aa(lp23
VBut was there anything before the Big Bang?
p24
aVIf not, what created the universe?
p25
aVWhy did the universe emerge from the Big Bang the way it did?
p26
aVWe used to think that the theory of the universe
p27
aVcould be divided into two parts.
p28
aVFirst, there were the laws
p29
aVlike Maxwell's equations and general relativity
p30
aVthat determined the evolution of the universe,
p31
aVgiven its state over all of space at one time.
p32
aVAnd second, there was no question of the initial state of the universe.
p33
aa(lp34
VWe have made good progress on the first part,
p35
aVand now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution
p36
aVin all but the most extreme conditions.
p37
aVBut until recently, we have had little idea
p38
aVabout the initial conditions for the universe.
p39
aVHowever, this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions
p40
aVdepends on time and space being separate and distinct.
p41
aVUnder extreme conditions, general relativity and quantum theory
p42
aVallow time to behave like another dimension of space.
p43
aVThis removes the distinction between time and space,
p44
aVand means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state.
p45
aVThe universe can spontaneously create itself out of nothing.
p46
aa(lp47
VMoreover, we can calculate a probability that the universe
p48
aVwas created in different states.
p49
aVThese predictions are in excellent agreement
p50
aVwith observations by the WMAP satellite of the cosmic microwave background,
p51
aVwhich is an imprint of the very early universe.
p52
aVWe think we have solved the mystery of creation.
p53
aVMaybe we should patent the universe
p54
aVand charge everyone royalties for their existence.
p55
aa(lp56
VI now turn to the second big question:
p57
aVare we alone, or is there other life in the universe?
p58
aVWe believe that life arose spontaneously on the Earth,
p59
aVso it must be possible for life to appear on other suitable planets,
p60
aVof which there seem to be a large number in the galaxy.
p61
aa(lp62
VBut we don't know how life first appeared.
p63
aVWe have two pieces of observational evidence
p64
aVon the probability of life appearing.
p65
aVThe first is that we have fossils of algae from 3.5 billion years ago.
p66
aVThe Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago
p67
aVand was probably too hot for about the first half billion years.
p68
aVSo life appeared on Earth
p69
aVwithin half a billion years of it being possible,
p70
aVwhich is short compared to the 10-billion-year lifetime
p71
aVof a planet of Earth type.
p72
aVThis suggests that the probability of life appearing is reasonably high.
p73
aVIf it was very low, one would have expected it
p74
aVto take most of the ten billion years available.
p75
aa(lp76
VOn the other hand, we don't seem to have been visited by aliens.
p77
aVI am discounting the reports of UFOs.
p78
aVWhy would they appear only to cranks and weirdos?
p79
aVIf there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports
p80
aVand keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring,
p81
aVit seems to have been a singularly ineffective policy so far.
p82
aVFurthermore, despite an extensive search by the SETI project,
p83
aVwe haven't heard any alien television quiz shows.
p84
aVThis probably indicates that there are no alien civilizations
p85
aVat our stage of development
p86
aVwithin a radius of a few hundred light years.
p87
aVIssuing an insurance policy
p88
aVagainst abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet.
p89
aa(lp90
VThis brings me to the last of the big questions:
p91
aVthe future of the human race.
p92
aVIf we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy,
p93
aVwe should make sure we survive and continue.
p94
aVBut we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history.
p95
aVOur population and our use of the finite resources of planet Earth
p96
aVare growing exponentially,
p97
aValong with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill.
p98
aVBut our genetic code
p99
aVstill carries the selfish and aggressive instincts
p100
aVthat were of survival advantage in the past.
p101
aVIt will be difficult enough to avoid disaster
p102
aVin the next hundred years,
p103
aVlet alone the next thousand or million.
p104
aa(lp105
VOur only chance of long-term survival
p106
aVis not to remain inward-looking on planet Earth,
p107
aVbut to spread out into space.
p108
aVThe answers to these big questions
p109
aVshow that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years.
p110
aVBut if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years,
p111
aVour future is in space.
p112
aVThat is why I am in favor of manned \u2014
p113
aVor should I say,  personned \u2014 space flight.
p114
aa(lp115
VAll of my life I have sought to understand the universe
p116
aVand find answers to these questions.
p117
aVI have been very lucky
p118
aVthat my disability has not been a serious handicap.
p119
aVIndeed, it has probably given me more time than most people
p120
aVto pursue the quest for knowledge.
p121
aVThe ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe,
p122
aVand we are making good progress.
p123
aVThank you for listening.
p124
aa(lp125
VChris Anderson: Professor, if you had to guess either way,
p126
aVdo you now believe that it is more likely than not
p127
aVthat we are alone in the Milky Way,
p128
aVas a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher?
p129
aVThis answer took seven minutes, and really gave me an insight
p130
aVinto the incredible act of generosity this whole talk was for TED.
p131
aa(lp132
VStephen Hawking: I think it quite likely that we are the only civilization
p133
aVwithin several hundred light years;
p134
aVotherwise we would have heard radio waves.
p135
aVThe alternative is that civilizations don't last very long,
p136
aVbut destroy themselves.
p137
aa(lp138
VCA: Professor Hawking, thank you for that answer.
p139
aVWe will take it as a salutary warning, I think,
p140
aVfor the rest of our conference this week.
p141
aVProfessor, we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you made
p142
aVto share your questions with us today.
p143
aVThank you very much indeed.

To the public, he&#39;s best known as an author of bestsellers such as&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/universeinanutshell\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>The Universe in a Nutshell</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/briefhistoryoftime\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>A Brief History of Time</em></a>, which have brought an appreciation of theoretical physics to millions.<br /><br />Though the motor neuron disorder ALS has confined Hawking to a wheelchair, it hasn&#39;t stopped him from lecturing widely, making appearances on television shows such as <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> and <em>The Simpsons</em> -- and planning a trip into orbit with <a href=\\"/index.php/speakers/view/id/161\\">Richard Branson</a>&#39;s Virgin Galactic. (He recently experienced weightlessness aboard <a href=\\"http://www.gozerog.com/\\">Zero Gravity Corporation</a>&#39;s &quot;Vomit Comet.&quot;) A true academic celebrity, <strong>he uses his public appearances to raise awareness about potential global disasters</strong> -- such as global warming -- and to speak out for the future of humanity: &quot;Getting a portion of the human race permanently off the planet is imperative for our future as a species,&quot; he says.<br /><br />Hawking serves as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, where he continues to contribute to both high-level physics and the popular understanding of our universe.</p>", "slug": "stephen_hawking", "whotheyare": "Stephen Hawking\'s scientific investigations have shed light on the origins of the cosmos, the nature of time and the ultimate fate of the universe.

VToday I'm going to talk about work.
p5
aVAnd the question I want to ask and answer is this:
p6
aV"Why do we work?"
p7
aVWhy do we drag ourselves out of bed every morning
p8
aVinstead of living our lives
p9
aVjust filled with bouncing from one TED-like adventure to another?
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VYou may be asking yourselves that very question.
p14
aVNow, I know of course, we have to make a living,
p15
aVbut nobody in this room thinks that that's the answer to the question,
p16
aV"Why do we work?"
p17
aVFor folks in this room, the work we do is challenging,
p18
aVit's engaging, it's stimulating, it's meaningful.
p19
aVAnd if we're lucky, it might even be important.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo, we wouldn't work if we didn't get paid,
p22
aVbut that's not why we do what we do.
p23
aVAnd in general,
p24
aVI think we think that material rewards are a pretty bad reason
p25
aVfor doing the work that we do.
p26
aVWhen we say of somebody that he's "in it for the money,"
p27
aVwe are not just being descriptive.
p28
aa(lp29
V(Laughter)
p30
aa(lp31
VNow, I think this is totally obvious,
p32
aVbut the very obviousness of it raises what is for me
p33
aVan incredibly profound question.
p34
aVWhy, if this is so obvious,
p35
aVwhy is it that for the overwhelming majority of people on the planet,
p36
aVthe work they do has none of the characteristics
p37
aVthat get us up and out of bed and off to the office every morning?
p38
aVHow is it that we allow the majority of people on the planet
p39
aVto do work that is monotonous, meaningless and soul-deadening?
p40
aVWhy is it that as capitalism developed,
p41
aVit created a mode of production, of goods and services,
p42
aVin which all the nonmaterial satisfactions that might come from work were eliminated?
p43
aVWorkers who do this kind of work,
p44
aVwhether they do it in factories, in call centers,
p45
aVor in fulfillment warehouses,
p46
aVdo it for pay.
p47
aVThere is certainly no other earthly reason to do what they do except for pay.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo the question is, "Why?"
p50
aVAnd here's the answer:
p51
aVthe answer is technology.
p52
aVNow, I know, I know \u2014
p53
aVyeah, yeah, yeah, technology, automation screws people, blah blah \u2014
p54
aVthat's not what I mean.
p55
aVI'm not talking about the kind of technology
p56
aVthat has enveloped our lives, and that people come to TED to hear about.
p57
aVI'm not talking about the technology of things,
p58
aVprofound though that is.
p59
aVI'm talking about another technology.
p60
aVI'm talking about the technology of ideas.
p61
aVI call it, "idea technology" \u2014
p62
aVhow clever of me.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VIn addition to creating things, science creates ideas.
p67
aVScience creates ways of understanding.
p68
aVAnd in the social sciences,
p69
aVthe ways of understanding that get created are ways of understanding ourselves.
p70
aVAnd they have an enormous influence on how we think, what we aspire to,
p71
aVand how we act.
p72
aa(lp73
VIf you think your poverty is God's will, you pray.
p74
aVIf you think your poverty is the result of your own inadequacy,
p75
aVyou shrink into despair.
p76
aVAnd if you think your poverty is the result of oppression and domination,
p77
aVthen you rise up in revolt.
p78
aVWhether your response to poverty is resignation or revolution,
p79
aVdepends on how you understand the sources of your poverty.
p80
aVThis is the role that ideas play in shaping us as human beings,
p81
aVand this is why idea technology may be the most profoundly important technology
p82
aVthat science gives us.
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd there's something special about idea technology,
p85
aVthat makes it different from the technology of things.
p86
aVWith things, if the technology sucks,
p87
aVit just vanishes, right?
p88
aVBad technology disappears.
p89
aVWith ideas \u2014
p90
aVfalse ideas about human beings will not go away
p91
aVif people believe that they're true.
p92
aVBecause if people believe that they're true,
p93
aVthey create ways of living and institutions
p94
aVthat are consistent with these very false ideas.
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd that's how the industrial revolution created a factory system
p97
aVin which there was really nothing you could possibly get out of your day's work,
p98
aVexcept for the pay at the end of the day.
p99
aVBecause the father \u2014 one of the fathers
p100
aVof the Industrial Revolution, Adam Smith \u2014
p101
aVwas convinced that human beings were by their very natures lazy,
p102
aVand wouldn't do anything unless you made it worth their while,
p103
aVand the way you made it worth their while
p104
aVwas by incentivizing, by giving them rewards.
p105
aVThat was the only reason anyone ever did anything.
p106
aVSo we created a factory system consistent with that false view of human nature.
p107
aVBut once that system of production was in place,
p108
aVthere was really no other way for people to operate,
p109
aVexcept in a way that was consistent with Adam Smith's vision.
p110
aVSo the work example is merely an example
p111
aVof how false ideas can create a circumstance
p112
aVthat ends up making them true.
p113
aa(lp114
VIt is not true
p115
aVthat you "just can't get good help anymore."
p116
aVIt is true
p117
aVthat you "can't get good help anymore"
p118
aVwhen you give people work to do that is demeaning and soulless.
p119
aVAnd interestingly enough, Adam Smith \u2014
p120
aVthe same guy who gave us this incredible invention
p121
aVof mass production, and division of labor
p122
aV\u2014 understood this.
p123
aVHe said, of people who worked in assembly lines,
p124
aVof men who worked in assembly lines, he says:
p125
aV"He generally becomes as stupid as it is possible for a human being to become."
p126
aVNow, notice the word here is "become."
p127
aV"He generally becomes as stupid as it is possible for a human being to become."
p128
aVWhether he intended it or not, what Adam Smith was telling us there,
p129
aVis that the very shape of the institution within which people work
p130
aVcreates people who are fitted to the demands of that institution
p131
aVand deprives people of the opportunity
p132
aVto derive the kinds of satisfactions from their work that we take for granted.
p133
aa(lp134
VThe thing about science \u2014 natural science \u2014
p135
aVis that we can spin fantastic theories about the cosmos,
p136
aVand have complete confidence
p137
aVthat the cosmos is completely indifferent to our theories.
p138
aVIt's going to work the same damn way
p139
aVno matter what theories we have about the cosmos.
p140
aVBut we do have to worry about the theories we have of human nature,
p141
aVbecause human nature will be changed by the theories we have
p142
aVthat are designed to explain and help us understand human beings.
p143
aa(lp144
VThe distinguished anthropologist, Clifford Geertz, said, years ago,
p145
aVthat human beings are the "unfinished animals."
p146
aVAnd what he meant by that was that it is only human nature
p147
aVto have a human nature
p148
aVthat is very much the product of the society in which people live.
p149
aVThat human nature, that is to say our human nature,
p150
aVis much more created than it is discovered.
p151
aVWe design human nature
p152
aVby designing the institutions within which people live and work.
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd so you people \u2014
p155
aVpretty much the closest I ever get to being with masters of the universe \u2014
p156
aVyou people should be asking yourself a question,
p157
aVas you go back home to run your organizations.
p158
aVJust what kind of human nature do you want to help design?
p159
aa(lp160
VThank you.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Applause)
p163
aa(lp164
VThanks.

His relatable examples, from consumer products (jeans, TVs, salad dressings) to lifestyle choices (where to live, what job to take, who and when to marry), underscore this central point: Too much choice undermines happiness.<br /><br />Schwartz&#39;s previous research has addressed morality, decision-making and the varied inter-relationships between science and society. Before <em>Paradox</em> he published <a href=\\"http://geni.us/costofliving\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>The Costs of Living</em></a>, which traces the impact of free-market thinking on the explosion of consumerism -- and <strong>the effect of the new capitalism on social and cultural institutions that once operated above the market, such as medicine, sports, and the law</strong>.<br /><br />Both books level serious criticism of modern western society, illuminating the under-reported psychological plagues of our time. But they also offer <strong>concrete ideas on addressing the problems</strong>, from a personal and societal level.</p><p>Schwartz is the author of the TED Book,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/whyweworkintl\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Why We Work</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>", "slug": "barry_schwartz", "whotheyare": "Barry Schwartz studies the link between economics and psychology, offering startling insights into modern life.

href=\\"http://geni.us/paradoxofchoice\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>The Paradox of Choice</em></a>, Barry Schwartz tackles one of the great mysteries of modern life: Why is it that societies of great abundance &mdash; where individuals are offered more freedom and choice (personal, professional, material) than ever before &mdash; are now witnessing a near-epidemic of depression? <strong>Conventional wisdom tells us that greater choice is for the greater good, but Schwartz argues the opposite</strong>: He makes a compelling case that the abundance of choice in today&#39;s western world is actually making us miserable. <br /><br /><strong>Infinite choice is paralyzing, Schwartz argues, and exhausting to the human psyche. </strong>It leads us to set unreasonably high expectations, question our choices before we even make them and blame our failures entirely on ourselves. His relatable examples, from consumer products (jeans, TVs, salad dressings) to lifestyle choices (where to live, what job to take, who and when to marry), underscore this central point: Too much choice undermines happiness.<br /><br />Schwartz&#39;s previous research has addressed morality, decision-making and the varied inter-relationships between science and society. Before <em>Paradox</em> he published <a href=\\"http://geni.us/costofliving\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>The Costs of Living</em></a>, which traces the impact of free-market thinking on the explosion of consumerism -- and <strong>the effect of the new capitalism on social and cultural institutions that once operated above the market, such as medicine, sports, and the law</strong>.<br /><br />Both books level serious criticism of modern western society, illuminating the under-reported psychological plagues of our time. But they also offer <strong>concrete ideas on addressing the problems</strong>, from a personal and societal level.</p><p>Schwartz is the author of the TED Book,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/whyweworkintl\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Why We Work</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>", "slug": "barry_schwartz", "whotheyare": "Barry Schwartz studies the link between economics and psychology, offering startling insights into modern life.

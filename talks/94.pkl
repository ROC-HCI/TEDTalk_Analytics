VIt's wonderful to be back.
p5
aVI love this wonderful gathering.
p6
aVAnd you must be wondering, "What on earth?
p7
aVHave they put up the wrong slide?"
p8
aVNo, no.
p9
aVLook at this magnificent beast,
p10
aVand ask the question: Who designed it?
p11
aa(lp12
VThis is TED; this is Technology, Entertainment, Design,
p13
aVand there's a dairy cow.
p14
aVIt's a quite wonderfully designed animal.
p15
aVAnd I was thinking, how do I introduce this?
p16
aVAnd I thought, well, maybe that old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer,
p17
aVyou know: "Poems are made by fools like me, but only God can make a tree."
p18
aVAnd you might say, "Well, God designed the cow."
p19
aa(lp20
VBut, of course, God got a lot of help.
p21
aVThis is the ancestor of cattle.
p22
aVThis is the aurochs.
p23
aVAnd it was designed by natural selection,
p24
aVthe process of natural selection, over many millions of years.
p25
aVAnd then it became domesticated, thousands of years ago.
p26
aVAnd human beings became its stewards,
p27
aVand, without even knowing what they were doing,
p28
aVthey gradually redesigned it and redesigned it and redesigned it.
p29
aVAnd then more recently, they really began to do reverse engineering on this beast
p30
aVand figure out just what the parts were, how they worked
p31
aVand how they might be optimized \u2014 how they might be made better.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow, why am I talking about cows?
p34
aVBecause I want to say that much the same thing is true of religions.
p35
aVReligions are natural phenomena \u2014 they're just as natural as cows.
p36
aVThey have evolved over millennia.
p37
aVThey have a biological base, just like the aurochs.
p38
aVThey have become domesticated,
p39
aVand human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years.
p40
aVThis is TED, and I want to talk about design.
p41
aVBecause what I've been doing for the last four years \u2014
p42
aVreally since the first time you saw me \u2014
p43
aVsome of you saw me at TED when I was talking about religion \u2014
p44
aVand in the last four years,
p45
aVI've been working just about non-stop on this topic.
p46
aVAnd you might say it's about the reverse engineering of religions.
p47
aVNow that very idea, I think, strikes terror in many people,
p48
aVor anger, or anxiety of one sort or another.
p49
aVAnd that is the spell that I want to break.
p50
aa(lp51
VI want to say, no, religions are an important natural phenomenon.
p52
aVWe should study them with the same intensity
p53
aVthat we study all the other important natural phenomena,
p54
aVlike global warming, as we heard so eloquently last night from Al Gore.
p55
aVToday's religions are brilliantly designed \u2014 brilliantly designed.
p56
aVThey are immensely powerful social institutions
p57
aVand many of their features can be traced back to earlier features
p58
aVthat we can really make sense of by reverse engineering.
p59
aVAnd, as with the cow, there's a mixture of evolutionary design \u2014
p60
aVdesigned by natural selection itself \u2014
p61
aVand intelligent design \u2014
p62
aVmore or less intelligent design \u2014
p63
aVand redesigned by human beings
p64
aVwho are trying to redesign their religions.
p65
aa(lp66
VYou don't do book talks at TED,
p67
aVbut I'm going to have just one slide about my book,
p68
aVbecause there is one message in it
p69
aVwhich I think this group really needs to hear.
p70
aVAnd I would be very interested to get your responses to this.
p71
aVIt's the one policy proposal that I make in the book,
p72
aVat this time, when I claim not to know enough about religion
p73
aVto know what other policy proposals to make.
p74
aVAnd it's one that echoes remarks that you've heard already today.
p75
aa(lp76
VHere's my proposal,
p77
aVI'm going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it:
p78
aVEducation on world religions for all of our children \u2014
p79
aVin primary school, in high school,
p80
aVin public schools, in private schools and in home schooling.
p81
aVSo what I'm proposing is,
p82
aVjust as we require reading, writing, arithmetic, American history,
p83
aVso we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world \u2014
p84
aVabout their history, about their creeds, about their texts,
p85
aVtheir music, their symbolisms, their prohibitions, their requirements.
p86
aVAnd this should be presented factually, straightforwardly,
p87
aVwith no particular spin, to all of the children in the country.
p88
aVAnd as long as you teach them that,
p89
aVyou can teach them anything else you like.
p90
aVThat, I think, is maximal tolerance for religious freedom.
p91
aVAs long as you inform your children about other religions,
p92
aVthen you may \u2014 and as early as you like and whatever you like \u2014
p93
aVteach them whatever creed you want them to learn.
p94
aVBut also let them know about other religions.
p95
aa(lp96
VNow, why do I say that?
p97
aVBecause democracy depends on an informed citizenship.
p98
aVInformed consent is the very bedrock of our understanding of democracy.
p99
aVMisinformed consent is not worth it.
p100
aVIt's like a coin flip; it doesn't count, really.
p101
aVDemocracy depends on informed consent.
p102
aVThis is the way we treat people as responsible adults.
p103
aVNow, children below the age of consent are a special case.
p104
aVParents \u2014 I'm going to use a word that Pastor Rick just used \u2014
p105
aVparents are stewards of their children.
p106
aVThey don't own them.
p107
aVYou can't own your children.
p108
aVYou have a responsibility to the world,
p109
aVto the state, to them, to take care of them right.
p110
aVYou may teach them whatever creed you think is most important,
p111
aVbut I say you have a responsibility to let them be informed
p112
aVabout all the other creeds in the world, too.
p113
aa(lp114
VThe reason I've taken this time is I've been fascinated to hear
p115
aVsome of the reactions to this.
p116
aVOne reviewer for a Roman Catholic newspaper called it "totalitarian."
p117
aVIt strikes me as practically libertarian.
p118
aVIs it totalitarian to require reading, writing and arithmetic?
p119
aVI don't think so.
p120
aVAll I'm saying is \u2014
p121
aVand facts, facts only; no values, just facts \u2014
p122
aVabout all the world's religions.
p123
aVAnother reviewer called it "hilarious."
p124
aVWell, I'm really bothered by the fact
p125
aVthat anybody would think that was hilarious.
p126
aVIt seems to me to be such a plausible,
p127
aVnatural extension of the democratic principles we already have
p128
aVthat I'm shocked to think anybody would find that just ridiculous.
p129
aVI know many religions
p130
aVare so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children
p131
aVthat they are intent on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths.
p132
aVI don't think that's defensible.
p133
aVBut I'd really be pleased to get your answers on that \u2014
p134
aVany reactions to that \u2014 later.
p135
aa(lp136
VBut now I'm going to move on.
p137
aVBack to the cow.
p138
aVThis picture, which I pulled off the web \u2014
p139
aVthe fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture.
p140
aVThat's the steward.
p141
aVCows couldn't live without human stewards \u2014 they're domesticated.
p142
aVThey're a sort of ectosymbiont.
p143
aVThey depend on us for their survival.
p144
aVAnd Pastor Rick was just talking about sheep.
p145
aVI'm going to talk about sheep, too.
p146
aVThere's a lot of serendipitous convergence here.
p147
aVHow clever it was of sheep to acquire shepherds!
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VThink of what this got them.
p152
aVThey could outsource all their problems:
p153
aVprotection from predators, food-finding ...
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
V... health maintenance.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VThe only cost in most flocks \u2014 not even this \u2014 a loss of free mating.
p162
aVWhat a deal!
p163
aV"How clever of sheep!" you might say.
p164
aVExcept, of course, it wasn't the sheep's cleverness.
p165
aVWe all know sheep are not exactly rocket scientists \u2014 they're not very smart.
p166
aVIt wasn't the cleverness of the sheep at all.
p167
aVThey were clueless.
p168
aVBut it was a very clever move.
p169
aVWhose clever move was it?
p170
aVIt was the clever move of natural selection itself.
p171
aa(lp172
VFrancis Crick, the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA
p173
aVwith Jim Watson,
p174
aVonce joked about what he called Orgel's Second Rule.
p175
aVLeslie Orgel is a molecular biologist, brilliant guy,
p176
aVand Orgel's Second Rule is:
p177
aVEvolution is cleverer than you are.
p178
aVNow, that is not Intelligent Design \u2014 not from Francis Crick.
p179
aVEvolution is cleverer than you are.
p180
aVIf you understand Orgel's Second Rule, then you understand
p181
aVwhy the Intelligent Design movement is basically a hoax.
p182
aa(lp183
VThe designs discovered by the process of natural selection
p184
aVare brilliant, unbelievably brilliant.
p185
aVAgain and again biologists are fascinated with the brilliance of what's discovered.
p186
aVBut the process itself is without purpose,
p187
aVwithout foresight, without design.
p188
aVWhen I was here four years ago,
p189
aVI told the story about an ant climbing a blade of grass.
p190
aVAnd why the ant was doing it was because its brain had been infected
p191
aVwith a lancet fluke that was needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow
p192
aVin order to reproduce.
p193
aVSo it was sort of a spooky story.
p194
aa(lp195
VAnd I think some people may have misunderstood.
p196
aVLancet flukes aren't smart.
p197
aVI submit that the intelligence of a lancet fluke is down there,
p198
aVsomewhere between petunia and carrot.
p199
aVThey're not really bright. They don't have to be.
p200
aVThe lesson we learn from this is:
p201
aVyou don't have to have a mind to be a beneficiary.
p202
aVThe design is there in nature, but it's not in anybody's head.
p203
aVIt doesn't have to be.
p204
aVThat's the way evolution works.
p205
aVQuestion: Was domestication good for sheep?
p206
aVIt was great for their genetic fitness.
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd here I want to remind you of a wonderful point
p209
aVthat Paul MacCready made at TED three years ago.
p210
aVHere's what he said:
p211
aV"Ten thousand years ago, at the dawn of agriculture,
p212
aVhuman population, plus livestock and pets,
p213
aVwas approximately a tenth of one percent of the terrestrial vertebrate landmass."
p214
aVThat was just 10,000 years ago.
p215
aVYesterday, in biological terms.
p216
aVWhat is it today? Does anybody remember what he told us?
p217
aV98 percent.
p218
aVThat is what we have done on this planet.
p219
aa(lp220
VNow, I talked to Paul afterwards \u2014 I wanted to check to find out
p221
aVhow he'd calculated this, and get the sources and so forth \u2014
p222
aVand he also gave me a paper that he had written on this.
p223
aVAnd there was a passage in it which he did not present here
p224
aVand I think it is so good, I'm going to read it to you:
p225
aV"Over billions of years on a unique sphere,
p226
aVchance has painted a thin covering of life:
p227
aVcomplex, improbable, wonderful and fragile.
p228
aVSuddenly, we humans \u2014 a recently arrived species
p229
aVno longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature \u2014
p230
aVhave grown in population, technology and intelligence
p231
aVto a position of terrible power.
p232
aVWe now wield the paintbrush."
p233
aVWe heard about the atmosphere as a thin layer of varnish.
p234
aVLife itself is just a thin coat of paint on this planet.
p235
aVAnd we're the ones that hold the paintbrush.
p236
aVAnd how can we do that?
p237
aa(lp238
VThe key to our domination of the planet is culture.
p239
aVAnd the key to culture is religion.
p240
aVSuppose Martian scientists came to Earth.
p241
aVThey would be puzzled by many things.
p242
aVAnybody know what this is? I'll tell you what it is.
p243
aVThis is a million people gathering on the banks of the Ganges in 2001,
p244
aVperhaps the largest single gathering of human beings ever,
p245
aVas seen from satellite photograph.
p246
aVHere's a big crowd.
p247
aVHere's another crowd in Mecca.
p248
aVMartians would be amazed by this.
p249
aVThey'd want to know how it originated,
p250
aVwhat it was for and how it perpetuates itself.
p251
aa(lp252
VActually, I'm going to pass over this.
p253
aVThe ant isn't alone.
p254
aVThere's all sorts of wonderful cases of species which \u2014 in that case \u2014
p255
aVA parasite gets into a mouse and needs to get into the belly of a cat.
p256
aVAnd it turns the mouse into Mighty Mouse, makes it fearless,
p257
aVso it runs out in the open, where it'll be eaten by a cat.
p258
aVTrue story.
p259
aVIn other words, we have these hijackers \u2014
p260
aVyou've seen this slide before, from four years ago \u2014
p261
aVa parasite that infects the brain and induces even suicidal behavior,
p262
aVon behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness.
p263
aa(lp264
VDoes that ever happen to us?
p265
aVYes, it does \u2014 quite wonderfully.
p266
aVThe Arabic word "Islam" means "submission."
p267
aVIt means "surrender of self-interest to the will of Allah."
p268
aVBut I'm not just talking about Islam.
p269
aVI'm talking also about Christianity.
p270
aVThis is a parchment music page that I found in a Paris bookstall
p271
aV50 years ago.
p272
aVAnd on it, it says, in Latin:
p273
aV"Semen est verbum Dei. Sator autem Christus."
p274
aVThe word of God is the seed and the sower of the seed is Christ.
p275
aVSame idea. Well, not quite.
p276
aVBut in fact, Christians, too ...
p277
aVglory in the fact that they have surrendered to God.
p278
aVI'll give you a few quotes.
p279
aV"The heart of worship is surrender.
p280
aVSurrendered people obey God's words, even if it doesn't make sense."
p281
aVThose words are by Rick Warren.
p282
aVThose are from "The Purpose Driven Life."
p283
aa(lp284
VAnd I want to turn now, briefly, to talk about that book, which I've read.
p285
aVYou've all got a copy,
p286
aVand you've just heard the man.
p287
aVAnd what I want to do now is say a bit about this book
p288
aVfrom the design standpoint,
p289
aVbecause I think it's actually a brilliant book.
p290
aVFirst of all, the goal \u2014 and you heard just now what the goal is \u2014
p291
aVit's to bring purpose to the lives of millions, and he has succeeded.
p292
aVIs it a good goal? In itself, I'm sure we all agree, it is a wonderful goal.
p293
aVHe's absolutely right.
p294
aVThere are lots of people out there who don't have purpose in their life,
p295
aVand bringing purpose to their life is a wonderful goal.
p296
aVI give him an A+ on this.
p297
aa(lp298
V(Laughter)
p299
aa(lp300
VIs the goal achieved?
p301
aVYes.
p302
aVThirty million copies of this book.
p303
aVAl Gore, eat your heart out.
p304
aa(lp305
V(Laughter)
p306
aa(lp307
VJust exactly what Al is trying to do, Rick is doing.
p308
aVThis is a fantastic achievement.
p309
aVAnd the means \u2014 how does he do it?
p310
aa(lp311
VIt's a brilliant redesign of traditional religious themes \u2014
p312
aVupdating them, quietly dropping obsolete features,
p313
aVputting new interpretations on other features.
p314
aVThis is the evolution of religion that's been going on for thousands of years,
p315
aVand he's just the latest brilliant practitioner of it.
p316
aVI don't have to tell you this; you just heard the man.
p317
aVExcellent insights into human psychology, wise advice on every page.
p318
aVMoreover, he invites us to look under the hood.
p319
aVI really appreciated that.
p320
aVFor instance, he has an appendix where he explains
p321
aVhis choice of translations of different Bible verses.
p322
aVThe book is clear, vivid, accessible, beautifully formatted.
p323
aVJust enough repetition.
p324
aVThat's really important.
p325
aVEvery time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain.
p326
aVEvery time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain.
p327
aa(lp328
V(Laughter)
p329
aa(lp330
VWith me, everybody \u2014
p331
aa(lp332
V(Audience and Dan Dennett) Every time you read it or say it,
p333
aVyou make another copy in your brain.
p334
aa(lp335
VThank you.
p336
aa(lp337
VAnd now we come to my problem.
p338
aVBecause I'm absolutely sincere in my appreciation
p339
aVof all that I said about this book.
p340
aVBut I wish it were better.
p341
aVI have some problems with the book.
p342
aVAnd it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems.
p343
aVI wish he could do this with a revision,
p344
aVa Mark 2 version of his book.
p345
aV"The truth will set you free."
p346
aVThat's what it says in the Bible,
p347
aVand it's something that I want to live by, too.
p348
aa(lp349
VMy problem is, some of the bits in it I don't think are true.
p350
aVNow some of this is a difference of opinion.
p351
aVAnd that's not my main complaint, that's worth mentioning.
p352
aVHere's a passage \u2014 it's very much what he said, anyway:
p353
aV"If there was no God we would all be accidents,
p354
aVthe result of astronomical random chance in the Universe.
p355
aVYou could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose
p356
aVor meaning or significance.
p357
aVThere would be no right or wrong
p358
aVand no hope beyond your brief years on Earth."
p359
aVNow, I just do not believe that.
p360
aVBy the way, I find \u2014 Homer Groening's film presented a beautiful alternative
p361
aVto that very claim.
p362
aVYes, there is meaning and a reason for right or wrong.
p363
aVWe don't need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning in us.
p364
aVBut that, as I said, is just a difference of opinion.
p365
aVThat's not what I'm really worried about.
p366
aa(lp367
VHow about this: "God designed this planet's environment
p368
aVjust so we could live in it."
p369
aVI'm afraid that a lot of people take that sentiment to mean
p370
aVthat we don't have to do the sorts of things
p371
aVthat Al Gore is trying so hard to get us to do.
p372
aVI am not happy with that sentiment at all.
p373
aVAnd then I find this: "All the evidence available in the biological sciences
p374
aVsupports the core proposition that the cosmos is a specially designed whole
p375
aVwith life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose,
p376
aVa whole in which all facets of reality have their meaning
p377
aVand explanation in this central fact."
p378
aVWell, that's Michael Denton. He's a creationist.
p379
aVAnd here, I think, "Wait a minute." I read this again.
p380
aVI read it three or four times and I think,
p381
aV"Is he really endorsing Intelligent Design?
p382
aVIs he endorsing creationism here?"
p383
aVAnd you can't tell.
p384
aVSo I'm sort of thinking, "Well, I don't know,
p385
aVI don't know if I want to get upset with this yet."
p386
aa(lp387
VBut then I read on, and I read this: "First, Noah had never seen rain,
p388
aVbecause prior to the Flood, God irrigated the earth from the ground up."
p389
aVI wish that sentence weren't in there, because I think it is false.
p390
aVAnd I think that thinking this way about the history of the planet,
p391
aVafter we've just been hearing about the history of the planet
p392
aVover millions of years,
p393
aVdiscourages people from scientific understanding.
p394
aVNow, Rick Warren uses scientific terms
p395
aVand scientific factoids and information in a very interesting way.
p396
aa(lp397
VHere's one: "God deliberately shaped and formed you to serve him
p398
aVin a way that makes your ministry unique.
p399
aVHe carefully mixed the DNA cocktail that created you."
p400
aVI think that's false.
p401
aVNow, maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical.
p402
aVHere's another one: "For instance, your brain can store 100 trillion facts.
p403
aVYour mind can handle 15,000 decisions a second."
p404
aVWell, it would be interesting to find the interpretation
p405
aVwhere I would accept that.
p406
aVThere might be some way of treating that as true.
p407
aV"Anthropologists have noted that worship is a universal urge,
p408
aVhardwired by God into the very fiber of our being \u2014
p409
aVan inbuilt need to connect with God."
p410
aVWell, the sense of which I agree with him,
p411
aVexcept I think it has an evolutionary explanation.
p412
aa(lp413
VAnd what I find deeply troubling in this book
p414
aVis that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral,
p415
aVif you want to have meaning in your life,
p416
aVyou have to be an Intelligent Designer,
p417
aVyou have to deny the theory of evolution by natural selection.
p418
aVAnd I think, on the contrary,
p419
aVthat it is very important to solving the world's problems
p420
aVthat we take evolutionary biology seriously.
p421
aVWhose truth are we going to listen to?
p422
aVWell, this is from "The Purpose Driven Life":
p423
aV"The Bible must become the authoritative standard for my life:
p424
aVthe compass I rely on for direction,
p425
aVthe counsel I listen to for making wise decisions,
p426
aVand the benchmark I use for evaluating everything."
p427
aVWell maybe, OK, but what's going to follow from this?
p428
aa(lp429
VAnd here's one that does concern me.
p430
aVRemember I quoted him before with this line:
p431
aV"Surrendered people obey God's word, even if it doesn't make sense."
p432
aVAnd that's a problem.
p433
aa(lp434
V(Sighs)
p435
aa(lp436
V"Don't ever argue with the Devil.
p437
aVHe's better at arguing than you are,
p438
aVhaving had thousands of years to practice."
p439
aVNow, Rick Warren didn't invent this clever move.
p440
aVIt's an old move.
p441
aVIt's a very clever adaptation of religions.
p442
aVIt's a wild card for disarming any reasonable criticism.
p443
aV"You don't like my interpretation?
p444
aVYou've got a reasonable objection to it?
p445
aVDon't listen, don't listen!
p446
aVThat's the Devil speaking."
p447
aVThis discourages the sort of reasoning citizenship
p448
aVit seems to me that we want to have.
p449
aa(lp450
VI've got one more problem, then I'm through.
p451
aVAnd I'd really like to get a response if Rick is able to do it.
p452
aV"In the Great Commission, Jesus said,
p453
aV'Go to all people of all nations and make them my disciples.
p454
aVBaptize them in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit,
p455
aVand teach them to do everything I've told you.'"
p456
aVThe Bible says Jesus is the only one who can save the world.
p457
aVWe've seen many wonderful maps of the world in the last day or so.
p458
aVHere's one, not as beautiful as the others;
p459
aVit simply shows the religions of the world.
p460
aVHere's one that shows the sort of current breakdown of the different religions.
p461
aa(lp462
VDo we really want to commit ourselves
p463
aVto engulfing all the other religions,
p464
aVwhen their holy books are telling them,
p465
aV"Don't listen to the other side, that's just Satan talking!"?
p466
aVIt seems to me that that's a very problematic ship
p467
aVto get on for the future.
p468
aVI found this sign as I was driving to Maine recently,
p469
aVin front of a church: "Good without God becomes zero."
p470
aVSort of cute.
p471
aVA very clever little meme.
p472
aVI don't believe it and I think this idea, popular as it is \u2014
p473
aVnot in this guise, but in general \u2014
p474
aVis itself one of the main problems that we face.
p475
aa(lp476
VIf you are like me, you know many wonderful, committed, engaged
p477
aVatheists, agnostics, who are being very good without God.
p478
aVAnd you also know many religious people who hide behind their sanctity
p479
aVinstead of doing good works.
p480
aVSo, I wish we could drop this meme.
p481
aVI wish this meme would go extinct.
p482
aa(lp483
VThanks very much for your attention.

He argues that the brain&#39;s computational circuitry fools us into thinking we know more than we do, and that what we call consciousness &mdash; isn&#39;t. His 2003 book &quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; explores how our brains evolved to give  us -- and only us -- the kind of freedom that matters, while 2006&#39;s  &quot;Breaking the Spell&quot; examines belief through the lens of biology.<br /><br />This mind-shifting perspective on the mind itself has distinguished Dennett&#39;s career as a philosopher and cognitive scientist. And while the philosophy community has never quite known what to make of Dennett (he defies easy categorization, and refuses to affiliate himself with accepted schools of thought), his computational approach to understanding the brain has made him, as Edge&#39;s John Brockman writes, &ldquo;the philosopher of choice of the AI community.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It&#39;s tempting to say that Dennett has never met a robot he didn&#39;t like, and that what he likes most about them is that they are philosophical experiments,&rdquo; Harry Blume wrote in the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1998. &ldquo;To the question of whether machines can attain high-order intelligence, Dennett makes this provocative answer: &lsquo;The best reason for believing that robots might some day become conscious is that we human beings are conscious, and we are a sort of robot ourselves.&#39;&quot;</p><p>In recent years, Dennett has become outspoken in his atheism, and his 2006 book&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/breakingthespell\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Breaking the Spell</em></a>&nbsp;calls for religion to be studied through the scientific lens of evolutionary biology. Dennett regards religion as a natural -- rather than supernatural -- phenomenon, and urges schools to break the taboo against empirical examination of religion. He argues that religion&#39;s influence over human behavior is precisely what makes gaining a rational understanding of it so necessary: &ldquo;If we don&#39;t understand religion, we&#39;re going to miss our chance to improve the world in the 21st century.&rdquo;</p><p>Dennett&#39;s landmark books include <em>The Mind&#39;s I</em>, co-edited with Douglas Hofstaedter,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/consciousnessexplained\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Consciousness Explained</em></a><em>,</em> and&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/darwinsdangerousidea\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Darwin&#39;s Dangerous Idea</em></a><em>. </em>Read an excerpt from his 2013 book, <a href=\\"http://geni.us/intuitionpumps\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Intuition Pumps</em></a>, in the <a href=\\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/may/19/daniel-dennett-intuition-pumps-thinking-extract\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Guardian</em> &gt;&gt;</a>  </p>", "slug": "dan_dennett", "whotheyare": "Dan Dennett argues that human consciousness and free will are the result of physical processes.", "whatotherssay": "Dan Dennett is our best current philosopher.

And while the philosophy community has never quite known what to make of Dennett (he defies easy categorization, and refuses to affiliate himself with accepted schools of thought), his computational approach to understanding the brain has made him, as Edge&#39;s John Brockman writes, &ldquo;the philosopher of choice of the AI community.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It&#39;s tempting to say that Dennett has never met a robot he didn&#39;t like, and that what he likes most about them is that they are philosophical experiments,&rdquo; Harry Blume wrote in the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1998. &ldquo;To the question of whether machines can attain high-order intelligence, Dennett makes this provocative answer: &lsquo;The best reason for believing that robots might some day become conscious is that we human beings are conscious, and we are a sort of robot ourselves.&#39;&quot;</p><p>In recent years, Dennett has become outspoken in his atheism, and his 2006 book&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/breakingthespell\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Breaking the Spell</em></a>&nbsp;calls for religion to be studied through the scientific lens of evolutionary biology. Dennett regards religion as a natural -- rather than supernatural -- phenomenon, and urges schools to break the taboo against empirical examination of religion. He argues that religion&#39;s influence over human behavior is precisely what makes gaining a rational understanding of it so necessary: &ldquo;If we don&#39;t understand religion, we&#39;re going to miss our chance to improve the world in the 21st century.&rdquo;</p><p>Dennett&#39;s landmark books include <em>The Mind&#39;s I</em>, co-edited with Douglas Hofstaedter,&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/consciousnessexplained\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Consciousness Explained</em></a><em>,</em> and&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/darwinsdangerousidea\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Darwin&#39;s Dangerous Idea</em></a><em>. </em>Read an excerpt from his 2013 book, <a href=\\"http://geni.us/intuitionpumps\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Intuition Pumps</em></a>, in the <a href=\\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/may/19/daniel-dennett-intuition-pumps-thinking-extract\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Guardian</em> &gt;&gt;</a>  </p>", "slug": "dan_dennett", "whotheyare": "Dan Dennett argues that human consciousness and free will are the result of physical processes.", "whatotherssay": "Dan Dennett is our best current philosopher.

VWhen I was a kid, my parents would tell me,
p5
aV"You can make a mess, but you have to clean up after yourself."
p6
aVSo freedom came with responsibility.
p7
aVBut my imagination would take me to all these wonderful places,
p8
aVwhere everything was possible.
p9
aVSo I grew up in a bubble of innocence \u2014
p10
aVor a bubble of ignorance, I should say,
p11
aVbecause adults would lie to us to protect us from the ugly truth.
p12
aVAnd growing up, I found out that adults make a mess,
p13
aVand they're not very good at cleaning up after themselves.
p14
aa(lp15
VFast forward, I am an adult now,
p16
aVand I teach citizen science and invention at the Hong Kong Harbour School.
p17
aVAnd it doesn't take too long
p18
aVbefore my students walk on a beach and stumble upon piles of trash.
p19
aVSo as good citizens, we clean up the beaches \u2014
p20
aVand no, he is not drinking alcohol, and if he is, I did not give it to him.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd so it's sad to say,
p25
aVbut today more than 80 percent  of the oceans have plastic in them.
p26
aVIt's a horrifying fact.
p27
aVAnd in past decades,
p28
aVwe've been taking those big ships out and those big nets,
p29
aVand we collect those plastic bits that we look at under a microscope,
p30
aVand we sort them,
p31
aVand then we put this data onto a map.
p32
aVBut that takes forever, it's very expensive,
p33
aVand so it's quite risky to take those big boats out.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo with my students, ages six to 15,
p36
aVwe've been dreaming of inventing a better way.
p37
aVSo we've transformed our tiny Hong Kong classroom into a workshop.
p38
aVAnd so we started building this small workbench,
p39
aVwith different heights, so even really short kids can participate.
p40
aVAnd let me tell you, kids with power tools are awesome and safe.
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VNot really.
p45
aVAnd so, back to plastic.
p46
aVWe collect this plastic and we grind it to the size we find it in the ocean,
p47
aVwhich is very small because it breaks down.
p48
aVAnd so this is how we work.
p49
aVI let the imaginations of my students run wild.
p50
aVAnd my job is to try to collect the best of each kid's idea
p51
aVand try to combine it into something that hopefully would work.
p52
aVAnd so we have agreed that instead of collecting plastic bits,
p53
aVwe are going to collect only the data.
p54
aVSo we're going to get an image of the plastic with a robot \u2014
p55
aVso robots, kids get very excited.
p56
aVAnd the next thing we do \u2014 we do what we call "rapid prototyping."
p57
aVWe are so rapid at prototyping
p58
aVthat the lunch is still in the lunchbox when we're hacking it.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd we hack table lamps and webcams, into plumbing fixtures
p63
aVand we assemble that into a floating robot that will be slowly moving through water
p64
aVand through the plastic that we have there \u2014
p65
aVand this is the image that we get in the robot.
p66
aVSo we see the plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor,
p67
aVand the computer on board will process this image,
p68
aVand measure the size of each particle,
p69
aVso we have a rough estimate of how much plastic there is in the water.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo we documented this invention step by step
p72
aVon a website for inventors called Instructables,
p73
aVin the hope that somebody would make it even better.
p74
aa(lp75
VWhat was really cool about this project was that the students saw a local problem,
p76
aVand boom \u2014 they are trying to immediately address it.
p77
aa(lp78
V[I can investigate my local problem]
p79
aa(lp80
VBut my students in Hong Kong are hyperconnected kids.
p81
aVAnd they watch the news, they watch the Internet,
p82
aVand they came across this image.
p83
aVThis was a child, probably under 10, cleaning up an oil spill bare-handed,
p84
aVin the Sundarbans, which is the world's largest mangrove forest in Bangladesh.
p85
aVSo they were very shocked,
p86
aVbecause this is the water they drink, this is the water they bathe in,
p87
aVthis is the water they fish in \u2014 this is the place where they live.
p88
aVAnd also you can see the water is brown, the mud is brown and oil is brown,
p89
aVso when everything is mixed up,
p90
aVit's really hard to see what's in the water.
p91
aVBut, there's a technology that's rather simple,
p92
aVthat's called spectrometry,
p93
aVthat allows you see what's in the water.
p94
aVSo we built a rough prototype of a spectrometer,
p95
aVand you can shine light through different substances
p96
aVthat produce different spectrums,
p97
aVso that can help you identify what's in the water.
p98
aVSo we packed this prototype of a sensor,
p99
aVand we shipped it to Bangladesh.
p100
aVSo what was cool about this project
p101
aVwas that beyond addressing a local problem,
p102
aVor looking at a local problem,
p103
aVmy students used their empathy and their sense of being creative
p104
aVto help, remotely, other kids.
p105
aa(lp106
V[I can investigate a remote problem]
p107
aa(lp108
VSo I was very compelled by doing the second experiments,
p109
aVand I wanted to take it even further \u2014
p110
aVmaybe addressing an even harder problem, and it's also closer to my heart.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo I'm half Japanese and half French,
p113
aVand maybe you remember in 2011 there was a massive earthquake in Japan.
p114
aVIt was so violent that it triggered several giant waves \u2014
p115
aVthey are called tsunami \u2014
p116
aVand those tsunami destroyed many cities on the eastern coast of Japan.
p117
aVMore than 14,000 people died in an instant.
p118
aVAlso, it damaged the nuclear power plant of Fukushima,
p119
aVthe nuclear power plant just by the water.
p120
aVAnd today, I read the reports
p121
aVand an average of 300 tons
p122
aVare leaking from the nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean.
p123
aVAnd today the whole Pacific Ocean has traces of contamination of cesium-137.
p124
aVIf you go outside on the West Coast, you can measure Fukushima everywhere.
p125
aVBut if you look at the map, it can look like most of the radioactivity
p126
aVhas been washed away from the Japanese coast,
p127
aVand most of it is now \u2014 it looks like it's safe, it's blue.
p128
aVWell, reality is a bit more complicated than this.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo I've been going to Fukushima every year since the accident,
p131
aVand I measure independently and with other scientists,
p132
aVon land, in the river \u2014
p133
aVand this time we wanted to take the kids.
p134
aVSo of course we didn't take the kids, the parents wouldn't allow that to happen.
p135
aa(lp136
V(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
VBut every night we would report to "Mission Control" \u2014
p139
aVdifferent masks they're wearing.
p140
aVIt could look like they didn't take the work seriously, but they really did
p141
aVbecause they're going to have to live with radioactivity their whole life.
p142
aVAnd so what we did with them
p143
aVis that we'd discuss the data we collected that day,
p144
aVand talk about where we should be going next \u2014
p145
aVstrategy, itinerary, etc...
p146
aVAnd to do this, we built a very rough topographical map
p147
aVof the region around the nuclear power plant.
p148
aVAnd so we built the elevation map,
p149
aVwe sprinkled pigments to represent real-time data for radioactivity,
p150
aVand we sprayed water to simulate the rainfall.
p151
aVAnd with this we could see that the radioactive dust
p152
aVwas washing from the top of the mountain into the river system,
p153
aVand leaking into the ocean.
p154
aVSo it was a rough estimate.
p155
aa(lp156
VBut with this in mind, we organized this expedition,
p157
aVwhich was the closest civilians have been to the nuclear power plant.
p158
aVWe are sailing 1.5 kilometers away from the nuclear power plant,
p159
aVand with the help of the local fisherman,
p160
aVwe are collecting sediment from the seabed
p161
aVwith a custom sediment sampler we've invented and built.
p162
aVWe pack the sediment into small bags,
p163
aVwe then dispatch them to hundreds of small bags
p164
aVthat we send to different universities,
p165
aVand we produce the map of the seabed radioactivity,
p166
aVespecially in estuaries where the fish will reproduce,
p167
aVand I will hope that we will have improved
p168
aVthe safety of the local fishermen and of your favorite sushi.
p169
aa(lp170
V(Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
VYou can see a progression here \u2014
p173
aVwe've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
p174
aVAnd it's been super exciting to work at these different scales,
p175
aVwith also very simple, open-source technologies.
p176
aVBut at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating
p177
aVbecause we have only started to measure the damage that we have done.
p178
aVWe haven't even started to try to solve the problems.
p179
aVAnd so I wonder if we should just take a leap
p180
aVand try to invent better ways to do all these things.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd so the classroom started to feel a little bit small,
p183
aVso we found an industrial site in Hong Kong,
p184
aVand we turned it into the largest mega-space
p185
aVfocused on social and environmental impact.
p186
aVIt's in central Hong Kong,
p187
aVand it's a place we can work with wood, metal, chemistry,
p188
aVa bit of biology, a bit of optics,
p189
aVbasically you can build pretty much everything there.
p190
aVAnd its a place where adults and kids can play together.
p191
aVIt's a place where kids' dreams can come true,
p192
aVwith the help of adults,
p193
aVand where adults can be kids again.
p194
aa(lp195
VStudent: Acceleration! Acceleration!
p196
aa(lp197
VCesar Harada: We're asking questions such as,
p198
aVcan we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy?
p199
aVFor example.
p200
aVOr, can we help the mobility of the aging population
p201
aVby transforming very standard wheelchairs into cool, electric vehicles?
p202
aa(lp203
VSo plastic, oil and radioactivity are horrible, horrible legacies,
p204
aVbut the very worst legacy that we can leave our children is lies.
p205
aVWe can no longer afford to shield the kids from the ugly truth
p206
aVbecause we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo citizen scientists, makers, dreamers \u2014
p209
aVwe must prepare the next generation
p210
aVthat cares about the environment and people,
p211
aVand that can actually do something about it.
p212
aa(lp213
VThank you.
p214

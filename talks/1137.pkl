VGood afternoon, everybody.
p5
aVI've got something to show you.
p6
aV(Laughter)
p7
aVThink about this as a pixel, a flying pixel.
p8
aVThis is what we call, in our lab, sensible design.
p9
aVLet me tell you a bit about it.
p10
aVNow if you take this picture \u2014 I'm Italian originally,
p11
aVand every boy in Italy grows up
p12
aVwith this picture on the wall of his bedroom \u2014
p13
aVbut the reason I'm showing you this
p14
aVis that something very interesting
p15
aVhappened in Formula 1 racing
p16
aVover the past couple of decades.
p17
aVNow some time ago,
p18
aVif you wanted to win a Formula 1 race,
p19
aVyou take a budget, and you bet your budget
p20
aVon a good driver and a good car.
p21
aVAnd if the car and the driver were good enough, then you'd win the race.
p22
aVNow today, if you want to win the race,
p23
aVactually you need also something like this \u2014
p24
aVsomething that monitors the car in real time,
p25
aVhas a few thousand sensors
p26
aVcollecting information from the car,
p27
aVtransmitting this information into the system,
p28
aVand then processing it
p29
aVand using it in order to go back to the car with decisions
p30
aVand changing things in real time
p31
aVas information is collected.
p32
aVThis is what, in engineering terms,
p33
aVyou would call a real time control system.
p34
aVAnd basically, it's a system made of two components \u2014
p35
aVa sensing and an actuating component.
p36
aa(lp37
VWhat is interesting today
p38
aVis that real time control systems
p39
aVare starting to enter into our lives.
p40
aVOur cities, over the past few years,
p41
aVjust have been blanketed
p42
aVwith networks, electronics.
p43
aVThey're becoming like computers in open air.
p44
aVAnd, as computers in open air,
p45
aVthey're starting to respond in a different way
p46
aVto be able to be sensed and to be actuated.
p47
aVIf we fix cities, actually it's a big deal.
p48
aVJust as an aside, I wanted to mention,
p49
aVcities are only two percent of the Earth's crust,
p50
aVbut they are 50 percent of the world's population.
p51
aVThey are 75 percent of the energy consumption \u2014
p52
aVup to 80 percent of CO2 emissions.
p53
aVSo if we're able to do something with cities, that's a big deal.
p54
aVBeyond cities,
p55
aVall of this sensing and actuating
p56
aVis entering our everyday objects.
p57
aa(lp58
VThat's from an exhibition that
p59
aVPaola Antonelli is organizing
p60
aVat MoMA later this year, during the summer.
p61
aVIt's called "Talk to Me."
p62
aVWell our objects, our environment
p63
aVis starting to talk back to us.
p64
aVIn a certain sense, it's almost as if every atom out there
p65
aVwere becoming both a sensor and an actuator.
p66
aVAnd that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans
p67
aVwith the environment out there.
p68
aVIn a certain sense,
p69
aVit's almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo ...
p70
aVyou know, when Michelangelo sculpted the Moses,
p71
aVat the end it said that he took the hammer, threw it at the Moses \u2014
p72
aVactually you can still see a small chip underneath \u2014
p73
aVand said, shouted,
p74
aV"Perché non parli? Why don't you talk?"
p75
aVWell today, for the first time,
p76
aVour environment is starting to talk back to us.
p77
aVAnd I'll show just a few examples \u2014
p78
aVagain, with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it.
p79
aa(lp80
VLet's starting with sensing.
p81
aVWell, the first project I wanted to share with you
p82
aVis actually one of the first projects by our lab.
p83
aVIt was four and a half years ago in Italy.
p84
aVAnd what we did there
p85
aVwas actually use a new type of network at the time
p86
aVthat had been deployed all across the world \u2014
p87
aVthat's a cellphone network \u2014
p88
aVand use anonymous and aggregated information from that network,
p89
aVthat's collected anyway by the operator,
p90
aVin order to understand
p91
aVhow the city works.
p92
aVThe summer was a lucky summer \u2014 2006.
p93
aVIt's when Italy won the soccer World Cup.
p94
aVSome of you might remember, it was Italy and France playing,
p95
aVand then Zidane at the end, the headbutt.
p96
aVAnd anyway, Italy won at the end.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VNow look at what happened that day
p101
aVjust by monitoring activity
p102
aVhappening on the network.
p103
aVHere you see the city.
p104
aVYou see the Colosseum in the middle,
p105
aVthe river Tiber.
p106
aVIt's morning, before the match.
p107
aVYou see the timeline on the top.
p108
aVEarly afternoon,
p109
aVpeople here and there,
p110
aVmaking calls and moving.
p111
aVThe match begins \u2014 silence.
p112
aVFrance scores. Italy scores.
p113
aVHalftime, people make a quick call and go to the bathroom.
p114
aVSecond half. End of normal time.
p115
aVFirst overtime, second.
p116
aVZidane, the headbutt in a moment.
p117
aVItaly wins. Yeah.
p118
aV(Laughter)
p119
aV(Applause)
p120
aVWell, that night, everybody went to celebrate in the center.
p121
aVYou saw the big peak.
p122
aVThe following day, again everybody went to the center
p123
aVto meet the winning team
p124
aVand the prime minister at the time.
p125
aVAnd then everybody moved down.
p126
aVYou see the image of the place called Circo Massimo,
p127
aVwhere, since Roman times, people go to celebrate,
p128
aVto have a big party, and you see the peak at the end of the day.
p129
aVWell, that's just one example of how we can sense the city today
p130
aVin a way that we couldn't have done
p131
aVjust a few years ago.
p132
aa(lp133
VAnother quick example about sensing:
p134
aVit's not about people,
p135
aVbut about things we use and consume.
p136
aVWell today, we know everything
p137
aVabout where our objects come from.
p138
aVThis is a map that shows you
p139
aVall the chips that form a Mac computer, how they came together.
p140
aVBut we know very little about where things go.
p141
aVSo in this project,
p142
aVwe actually developed some small tags
p143
aVto track trash as it moves through the system.
p144
aVSo we actually started with a number of volunteers
p145
aVwho helped us in Seattle,
p146
aVjust over a year ago,
p147
aVto tag what they were throwing away \u2014
p148
aVdifferent types of things, as you can see here \u2014
p149
aVthings they would throw away anyway.
p150
aVThen we put a little chip, little tag,
p151
aVonto the trash
p152
aVand then started following it.
p153
aVHere are the results we just obtained.
p154
aa(lp155
V(Music)
p156
aa(lp157
VFrom Seattle ...
p158
aVafter one week.
p159
aVWith this information we realized
p160
aVthere's a lot of inefficiencies in the system.
p161
aVWe can actually do the same thing with much less energy.
p162
aVThis data was not available before.
p163
aVBut there's a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening.
p164
aVBut the other thing is that we believe
p165
aVthat if we see every day
p166
aVthat the cup we're throwing away, it doesn't disappear,
p167
aVit's still somewhere on the planet.
p168
aVAnd the plastic bottle we're throwing away every day still stays there.
p169
aVAnd if we show that to people,
p170
aVthen we can also promote some behavioral change.
p171
aVSo that was the reason for the project.
p172
aa(lp173
VMy colleague at MIT, Assaf Biderman,
p174
aVhe could tell you much more about sensing
p175
aVand many other wonderful things we can do with sensing,
p176
aVbut I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning,
p177
aVand that's actuating our environment.
p178
aVAnd the first project
p179
aVis something we did a couple of years ago in Zaragoza, Spain.
p180
aVIt started with a question by the mayor of the city,
p181
aVwho came to us saying
p182
aVthat Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition
p183
aVof using water in public space, in architecture.
p184
aVAnd the question was: How could technology, new technology,
p185
aVbe added to that?
p186
aVAnd one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a workshop
p187
aVwas, imagine this pipe, and you've got valves,
p188
aVsolenoid valves, taps,
p189
aVopening and closing.
p190
aVYou create like a water curtain with pixels made of water.
p191
aVIf those pixels fall,
p192
aVyou can write on it,
p193
aVyou can show patterns, images, text.
p194
aVAnd even you can approach it, and it will open up
p195
aVto let you jump through,
p196
aVas you see in this image.
p197
aa(lp198
VWell, we presented this to Mayor Belloch.
p199
aVHe liked it very much.
p200
aVAnd we got a commission to design a building
p201
aVat the entrance of the expo.
p202
aVWe called it Digital Water Pavilion.
p203
aVThe whole building is made of water.
p204
aVThere's no doors or windows,
p205
aVbut when you approach it,
p206
aVit will open up to let you in.
p207
aV(Music)
p208
aVThe roof also is covered with water.
p209
aVAnd if there's a bit of wind,
p210
aVif you want to minimize splashing, you can actually lower the roof.
p211
aVOr you could close the building,
p212
aVand the whole architecture will disappear,
p213
aVlike in this case.
p214
aVYou know, these days, you always get images during the winter,
p215
aVwhen they take the roof down,
p216
aVof people who have been there and said, "They demolished the building."
p217
aVNo, they didn't demolish it, just when it goes down,
p218
aVthe architecture almost disappears.
p219
aVHere's the building working.
p220
aVYou see the person puzzled about what was going on inside.
p221
aVAnd here was myself trying not to get wet,
p222
aVtesting the sensors that open the water.
p223
aa(lp224
VWell, I should tell you now what happened one night
p225
aVwhen all of the sensors stopped working.
p226
aVBut actually that night, it was even more fun.
p227
aVAll the kids from Zaragoza came to the building,
p228
aVbecause the way of engaging with the building became something different.
p229
aVNot anymore a building that would open up to let you in,
p230
aVbut a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water,
p231
aVand you had to jump without getting wet.
p232
aa(lp233
V(Video) (Crowd Noise)
p234
aa(lp235
VAnd that was, for us, was very interesting,
p236
aVbecause, as architects, as engineers, as designers,
p237
aVwe always think about how people will use the things we design.
p238
aVBut then reality's always unpredictable.
p239
aVAnd that's the beauty of doing things
p240
aVthat are used and interact with people.
p241
aa(lp242
VHere is an image then of the building
p243
aVwith the physical pixels, the pixels made of water,
p244
aVand then projections on them.
p245
aVAnd this is what led us to think about
p246
aVthe following project I'll show you now.
p247
aVThat's, imagine those pixels could actually start flying.
p248
aVImagine you could have small helicopters
p249
aVthat move in the air,
p250
aVand then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights \u2014
p251
aValmost as a cloud that can move in space.
p252
aVHere is the video.
p253
aa(lp254
V(Music)
p255
aa(lp256
VSo imagine one helicopter,
p257
aVlike the one we saw before,
p258
aVmoving with others,
p259
aVin synchrony.
p260
aVSo you can have this cloud.
p261
aVYou can have a kind of flexible screen or display, like this \u2014
p262
aVa regular configuration in two dimensions.
p263
aVOr in regular, but in three dimensions,
p264
aVwhere the thing that changes is the light,
p265
aVnot the pixels' position.
p266
aVYou can play with a different type.
p267
aVImagine your screen could just appear
p268
aVin different scales or sizes,
p269
aVdifferent types of resolution.
p270
aVBut then the whole thing can be
p271
aVjust a 3D cloud of pixels
p272
aVthat you can approach and move through it
p273
aVand see from many, many directions.
p274
aVHere is the real Flyfire
p275
aVcontrol and going down to form the regular grid as before.
p276
aVWhen you turn on the light, actually you see this. So the same as we saw before.
p277
aVAnd imagine each of them then controlled by people.
p278
aVYou can have each pixel
p279
aVhaving an input that comes from people,
p280
aVfrom people's movement, or so and so.
p281
aa(lp282
VI want to show you something here for the first time.
p283
aVWe've been working with Roberto Bolle,
p284
aVone of today's top ballet dancers \u2014
p285
aVthe étoile at Metropolitan in New York
p286
aVand La Scala in Milan \u2014
p287
aVand actually captured his movement in 3D
p288
aVin order to use it as an input for Flyfire.
p289
aVAnd here you can see Roberto dancing.
p290
aVYou see on the left the pixels,
p291
aVthe different resolutions being captured.
p292
aVIt's both 3D scanning in real time
p293
aVand motion capture.
p294
aVSo you can reconstruct a whole movement.
p295
aVYou can go all the way through.
p296
aVBut then, once we have the pixels, then you can play with them
p297
aVand play with color and movement
p298
aVand gravity and rotation.
p299
aVSo we want to use this as one of the possible inputs
p300
aVfor Flyfire.
p301
aa(lp302
VI wanted to show you the last project we are working on.
p303
aVIt's something we're working on for the London Olympics.
p304
aVIt's called The Cloud.
p305
aVAnd the idea here is, imagine, again,
p306
aVwe can involve people
p307
aVin doing something and changing our environment \u2014
p308
aValmost to impart what we call cloud raising \u2014
p309
aVlike barn raising, but with a cloud.
p310
aVImagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel.
p311
aVAnd I think what is remarkable
p312
aVthat has happened over the past couple of years
p313
aVis that, over the past couple of decades,
p314
aVwe went from the physical world to the digital one.
p315
aVThis has been digitizing everything, knowledge,
p316
aVand making that accessible through the Internet.
p317
aa(lp318
VNow today, for the first time \u2014
p319
aVand the Obama campaign showed us this \u2014
p320
aVwe can go from the digital world,
p321
aVfrom the self-organizing power of networks,
p322
aVto the physical one.
p323
aVThis can be, in our case,
p324
aVwe want to use it for designing and doing a symbol.
p325
aVThat means something built in a city.
p326
aVBut tomorrow it can be,
p327
aVin order to tackle today's pressing challenges \u2014
p328
aVthink about climate change or CO2 emissions \u2014
p329
aVhow we can go from the digital world to the physical one.
p330
aVSo the idea that we can actually involve people
p331
aVin doing this thing together, collectively.
p332
aa(lp333
VThe cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels,
p334
aVin the same way as the real cloud
p335
aVis a cloud made of particles.
p336
aVAnd those particles are water,
p337
aVwhere our cloud is a cloud of pixels.
p338
aVIt's a physical structure in London, but covered with pixels.
p339
aVYou can move inside, have different types of experiences.
p340
aVYou can actually see from underneath,
p341
aVsharing the main moments
p342
aVfor the Olympics in 2012 and beyond,
p343
aVand really using it as a way to connect with the community.
p344
aVSo both the physical cloud in the sky
p345
aVand something you can go to the top [of],
p346
aVlike London's new mountaintop.
p347
aVYou can enter inside it.
p348
aVAnd a kind of new digital beacon for the night \u2014
p349
aVbut most importantly,
p350
aVa new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top.
p351
aa(lp352
VThank you.

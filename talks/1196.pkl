VThe question today is not:
p5
aVWhy did we invade Afghanistan?
p6
aVThe question is:
p7
aVwhy are we still in Afghanistan
p8
aVone decade later?
p9
aVWhy are we spending
p10
aV$135 billion?
p11
aVWhy have we got 130,000 troops on the ground?
p12
aVWhy were more people killed
p13
aVlast month
p14
aVthan in any preceding month
p15
aVof this conflict?
p16
aVHow has this happened?
p17
aVThe last 20 years
p18
aVhas been the age of intervention,
p19
aVand Afghanistan is simply one act
p20
aVin a five-act tragedy.
p21
aVWe came out of the end of the Cold War
p22
aVin despair.
p23
aVWe faced Rwanda;
p24
aVwe faced Bosnia,
p25
aVand then we rediscovered our confidence.
p26
aVIn the third act, we went into Bosnia and Kosovo
p27
aVand we seemed to succeed.
p28
aVIn the fourth act, with our hubris,
p29
aVour overconfidence developing,
p30
aVwe invaded Iraq and Afghanistan,
p31
aVand in the fifth act,
p32
aVwe plunged into a humiliating mess.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo the question is: What are we doing?
p35
aVWhy are we still stuck in Afghanistan?
p36
aVAnd the answer, of course,
p37
aVthat we keep being given
p38
aVis as follows:
p39
aVwe're told that we went into Afghanistan
p40
aVbecause of 9/11,
p41
aVand that we remain there
p42
aVbecause the Taliban poses an existential threat
p43
aVto global security.
p44
aVIn the words of President Obama,
p45
aV"If the Taliban take over again,
p46
aVthey will invite back Al-Qaeda,
p47
aVwho will try to kill as many of our people
p48
aVas they possibly can."
p49
aVThe story that we're told
p50
aVis that there was a "light footprint" initially \u2014
p51
aVin other words, that we ended up in a situation
p52
aVwhere we didn't have enough troops,
p53
aVwe didn't have enough resources,
p54
aVthat Afghans were frustrated \u2014
p55
aVthey felt there wasn't enough progress
p56
aVand economic development and security,
p57
aVand therefore the Taliban came back \u2014
p58
aVthat we responded in 2005 and 2006
p59
aVwith troop deployments,
p60
aVbut we still didn't put enough troops on the ground.
p61
aVAnd that it wasn't until 2009,
p62
aVwhen President Obama signed off on a surge,
p63
aVthat we finally had,
p64
aVin the words of Secretary Clinton,
p65
aV"the strategy, the leadership and the resources."
p66
aVSo, as the president now reassures us,
p67
aVwe are on track to achieve our goals.
p68
aa(lp69
VAll of this is wrong.
p70
aVEvery one of those statements is wrong.
p71
aVAfghanistan does not
p72
aVpose an existential threat
p73
aVto global security.
p74
aVIt is extremely unlikely
p75
aVthe Taliban would ever be able to take over the country \u2014
p76
aVextremely unlikely they'd be able to seize Kabul.
p77
aVThey simply don't have a conventional military option.
p78
aVAnd even if they were able to do so, even if I'm wrong,
p79
aVit's extremely unlikely
p80
aVthe Taliban would invite back Al-Qaeda.
p81
aVFrom the Taliban's point of view,
p82
aVthat was their number one mistake last time.
p83
aVIf they hadn't invited back Al-Qaeda,
p84
aVthey would still be in power today.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd even if I'm wrong about those two things,
p87
aVeven if they were able to take back the country,
p88
aVeven if they were to invite back Al-Qaeda,
p89
aVit's extremely unlikely
p90
aVthat Al-Qaeda would significantly enhance
p91
aVits ability to harm the United States
p92
aVor harm Europe.
p93
aVBecause this isn't the 1990s anymore.
p94
aVIf the Al-Qaeda base
p95
aVwas to be established near Ghazni,
p96
aVwe would hit them very hard,
p97
aVand it would be very, very difficult
p98
aVfor the Taliban to protect them.
p99
aa(lp100
VFurthermore, it's simply not true
p101
aVthat what went wrong in Afghanistan
p102
aVis the light footprint.
p103
aVIn my experience, in fact,
p104
aVthe light footprint was extremely helpful.
p105
aVAnd these troops that we brought in \u2014
p106
aVit's a great picture of David Beckham
p107
aVthere on the sub-machine gun \u2014
p108
aVmade the situation worse, not better.
p109
aVWhen I walked across Afghanistan
p110
aVin the winter of 2001-2002,
p111
aVwhat I saw was scenes like this.
p112
aVA girl, if you're lucky,
p113
aVin the corner of a dark room \u2014
p114
aVlucky to be able to look at the Koran.
p115
aVBut in those early days
p116
aVwhen we're told we didn't have enough troops and enough resources,
p117
aVwe made a lot of progress in Afghanistan.
p118
aVWithin a few months,
p119
aVthere were two and a half million more girls in school.
p120
aVIn Sangin where I was sick in 2002,
p121
aVthe nearest health clinic
p122
aVwas within three days walk.
p123
aVToday, there are 14 health clinics
p124
aVin that area alone.
p125
aVThere was amazing improvements.
p126
aVWe went from almost no Afghans
p127
aVhaving mobile telephones during the Taliban
p128
aVto a situation where, almost overnight,
p129
aVthree million Afghans had mobile telephones.
p130
aVAnd we had progress in the free media.
p131
aVWe had progress in elections \u2014
p132
aVall of this with the so-called light footprint.
p133
aa(lp134
VBut when we began to bring more money,
p135
aVwhen we began to invest more resources,
p136
aVthings got worse, not better. How?
p137
aVWell first see, if you put 125 billion dollars a year
p138
aVinto a country like Afghanistan
p139
aVwhere the entire revenue of the Afghan state
p140
aVis one billion dollars a year,
p141
aVyou drown everything.
p142
aVIt's not simply corruption and waste
p143
aVthat you create;
p144
aVyou essentially replace the priorities of the Afghan government,
p145
aVthe elected Afghan government,
p146
aVwith the micromanaging tendencies
p147
aVof foreigners on short tours
p148
aVwith their own priorities.
p149
aVAnd the same is true for the troops.
p150
aa(lp151
VWhen I walked across Afghanistan,
p152
aVI stayed with people like this.
p153
aVThis is Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj.
p154
aVCommandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj was a great host.
p155
aVHe was very generous,
p156
aVlike many of the Afghans I stayed with.
p157
aVBut he was also considerably more conservative,
p158
aVconsiderably more anti-foreign,
p159
aVconsiderably more Islamist
p160
aVthan we'd like to acknowledge.
p161
aVThis man, for example, Mullah Mustafa,
p162
aVtried to shoot me.
p163
aVAnd the reason I'm looking a little bit perplexed in this photograph
p164
aVis I was somewhat frightened,
p165
aVand I was too afraid on this occasion
p166
aVto ask him, having run for an hour through the desert
p167
aVand taken refuge in this house,
p168
aVwhy he had turned up and wanted to have his photograph taken with me.
p169
aVBut 18 months later, I asked him
p170
aVwhy he had tried to shoot me.
p171
aVAnd Mullah Mustafa \u2014 he's the man with the pen and paper \u2014
p172
aVexplained that the man sitting immediately to the left as you look at the photograph,
p173
aVNadir Shah
p174
aVhad bet him that he couldn't hit me.
p175
aVNow this is not to say
p176
aVAfghanistan is a place full of people like Mullah Mustafa.
p177
aVIt's not; it's a wonderful place
p178
aVfull of incredible energy and intelligence.
p179
aVBut it is a place
p180
aVwhere the putting-in of the troops
p181
aVhas increased the violence rather than decreased it.
p182
aa(lp183
V2005, Anthony Fitzherbert,
p184
aVan agricultural engineer,
p185
aVcould travel through Helmand,
p186
aVcould stay in Nad Ali, Sangin and Ghoresh,
p187
aVwhich are now the names of villages where fighting is taking place.
p188
aVToday, he could never do that.
p189
aVSo the idea that we deployed the troops
p190
aVto respond to the Taliban insurgency
p191
aVis mistaken.
p192
aVRather than preceding the insurgency,
p193
aVthe Taliban followed the troop deployment,
p194
aVand as far as I'm concerned,
p195
aVthe troop deployment caused their return.
p196
aa(lp197
VNow is this a new idea?
p198
aVNo, there have been any number of people
p199
aVsaying this over the last seven years.
p200
aVI ran a center at Harvard
p201
aVfrom 2008 to 2010,
p202
aVand there were people like Michael Semple there
p203
aVwho speak Afghan languages fluently,
p204
aVwho've traveled to almost every district in the country.
p205
aVAndrew Wilder, for example,
p206
aVborn on the Pakistan-Iranian border,
p207
aVserved his whole life
p208
aVin Pakistan and Afghanistan.
p209
aVPaul Fishstein who began working there in 1978 \u2014
p210
aVworked for Save the Children,
p211
aVran the Afghan research and evaluation unit.
p212
aVThese are people
p213
aVwho were able to say consistently
p214
aVthat the increase in development aid
p215
aVwas making Afghanistan less secure, not more secure \u2014
p216
aVthat the counter-insurgency strategy
p217
aVwas not working and would not work.
p218
aVAnd yet, nobody listened to them.
p219
aVInstead,
p220
aVthere was a litany of astonishing optimism.
p221
aa(lp222
VBeginning in 2004,
p223
aVevery general came in saying,
p224
aV"I've inherited a dismal situation,
p225
aVbut finally I have the right resources and the correct strategy,
p226
aVwhich will deliver,"
p227
aVin General Barno's word in 2004,
p228
aVthe "decisive year."
p229
aVWell guess what? It didn't.
p230
aVBut it wasn't sufficient to prevent General Abuzaid saying
p231
aVthat he had the strategy and the resources
p232
aVto deliver, in 2005,
p233
aVthe "decisive year."
p234
aVOr General David Richards to come in 2006
p235
aVand say he had the strategy and the resources
p236
aVto deliver the "crunch year."
p237
aVOr in 2007,
p238
aVthe Norwegian deputy foreign minister, Espen Eide,
p239
aVto say that that would deliver the "decisive year."
p240
aVOr in 2008, Major General Champoux
p241
aVto come in and say he would deliver the "decisive year."
p242
aVOr in 2009, my great friend,
p243
aVGeneral Stanley McChrystal,
p244
aVwho said that he was "knee-deep in the decisive year."
p245
aVOr in 2010,
p246
aVthe U.K. foreign secretary, David Miliband,
p247
aVwho said that at last we would deliver the "decisive year."
p248
aVAnd you'll be delighted to hear in 2011, today,
p249
aVthat Guido Westerwelle, the German foreign minister,
p250
aVassures us that we are in the "decisive year."
p251
aa(lp252
V(Applause)
p253
aa(lp254
VHow do we allow
p255
aVany of this to happen?
p256
aVWell the answer, of course, is,
p257
aVif you spend 125 billion or 130 billion
p258
aVdollars a year in a country,
p259
aVyou co-opt almost everybody.
p260
aVEven the aid agencies,
p261
aVwho begin to receive an enormous amount of money
p262
aVfrom the U.S. and the European governments
p263
aVto build schools and clinics,
p264
aVare somewhat disinclined
p265
aVto challenge the idea
p266
aVthat Afghanistan is an existential threat
p267
aVto global security.
p268
aVThey're worried, in other words,
p269
aVthat if anybody believes that it wasn't such a threat \u2014
p270
aVOxfam, Save the Children
p271
aVwouldn't get the money
p272
aVto build their hospitals and schools.
p273
aVIt's also very difficult to confront a general
p274
aVwith medals on his chest.
p275
aVIt's very difficult for a politician,
p276
aVbecause you're afraid that many lives have been lost in vain.
p277
aVYou feel deep, deep guilt.
p278
aVYou exaggerate your fears,
p279
aVand you're terrified about the humiliation
p280
aVof defeat.
p281
aa(lp282
VWhat is the solution to this?
p283
aVWell the solution to this
p284
aVis we need to find a way
p285
aVthat people like Michael Semple, or those other people,
p286
aVwho are telling the truth, who know the country,
p287
aVwho've spent 30 years on the ground \u2014
p288
aVand most importantly of all,
p289
aVthe missing component of this \u2014
p290
aVAfghans themselves,
p291
aVwho understand what is going on.
p292
aVWe need to somehow get their message
p293
aVto the policymakers.
p294
aVAnd this is very difficult to do
p295
aVbecause of our structures.
p296
aa(lp297
VThe first thing we need to change
p298
aVis the structures of our government.
p299
aVVery, very sadly,
p300
aVour foreign services, the United Nations,
p301
aVthe military in these countries
p302
aVhave very little idea of what's going on.
p303
aVThe average British soldier is on a tour of only six months;
p304
aVItalian soldiers, on tours of four months;
p305
aVthe American military, on tours of 12 months.
p306
aVDiplomats are locked in embassy compounds.
p307
aVWhen they go out, they travel in these curious armored vehicles
p308
aVwith these somewhat threatening security teams
p309
aVwho ready 24 hours in advance
p310
aVwho say you can only stay on the ground for an hour.
p311
aa(lp312
VIn the British embassy in Afghanistan
p313
aVin 2008,
p314
aVan embassy of 350 people,
p315
aVthere were only three people who could speak Dari,
p316
aVthe main language of Afghanistan, at a decent level.
p317
aVAnd there was not a single Pashto speaker.
p318
aVIn the Afghan section in London
p319
aVresponsible for governing Afghan policy on the ground,
p320
aVI was told last year
p321
aVthat there was not a single staff member
p322
aVof the foreign office in that section
p323
aVwho had ever served
p324
aVon a posting in Afghanistan.
p325
aVSo we need to change that institutional culture.
p326
aVAnd I could make the same points about the United States
p327
aVand the United Nations.
p328
aa(lp329
VSecondly, we need to aim off of the optimism of the generals.
p330
aVWe need to make sure that we're a little bit suspicious,
p331
aVthat we understand that optimism
p332
aVis in the DNA of the military,
p333
aVthat we don't respond to it
p334
aVwith quite as much alacrity.
p335
aVAnd thirdly, we need to have some humility.
p336
aVWe need to begin from the position
p337
aVthat our knowledge, our power,
p338
aVour legitimacy
p339
aVis limited.
p340
aVThis doesn't mean
p341
aVthat intervention around the world is a disaster.
p342
aVIt isn't.
p343
aa(lp344
VBosnia and Kosovo
p345
aVwere signal successes,
p346
aVgreat successes.
p347
aVToday when you go to Bosnia
p348
aVit is almost impossible to believe
p349
aVthat what we saw in the early 1990s happened.
p350
aVIt's almost impossible to believe the progress we've made
p351
aVsince 1994.
p352
aVRefugee return,
p353
aVwhich the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
p354
aVthought would be extremely unlikely,
p355
aVhas largely happened.
p356
aVA million properties have been returned.
p357
aVBorders between the Bosniak territory
p358
aVand the Bosnian-Serb territory have calmed down.
p359
aVThe national army has shrunk.
p360
aVThe crime rates in Bosnia today
p361
aVare lower than they are in Sweden.
p362
aa(lp363
VThis has been done
p364
aVby an incredible, principled effort
p365
aVby the international community,
p366
aVand, of course, above all,
p367
aVby Bosnians themselves.
p368
aVBut you need to look at context.
p369
aVAnd this is what we've lost in Afghanistan and Iraq.
p370
aVYou need to understand that in those places
p371
aVwhat really mattered
p372
aVwas, firstly, the role of Tudman and Milosevic
p373
aVin coming to the agreement,
p374
aVand then the fact those men went,
p375
aVthat the regional situation improved,
p376
aVthat the European Union could offer Bosnia
p377
aVsomething extraordinary:
p378
aVthe chance to be part
p379
aVof a new thing, a new club,
p380
aVa chance to join something bigger.
p381
aa(lp382
VAnd finally, we need to understand that in Bosnia and Kosovo,
p383
aVa lot of the secret of what we did,
p384
aVa lot of the secret of our success,
p385
aVwas our humility \u2014
p386
aVwas the tentative nature of our engagement.
p387
aVWe criticized people a lot in Bosnia
p388
aVfor being quite slow to take on war criminals.
p389
aVWe criticized them
p390
aVfor being quite slow to return refugees.
p391
aVBut that slowness, that caution,
p392
aVthe fact that President Clinton initially said
p393
aVthat American troops would only be deployed for a year,
p394
aVturned out to be a strength,
p395
aVand it helped us to put our priorities right.
p396
aa(lp397
VOne of the saddest things
p398
aVabout our involvement in Afghanistan
p399
aVis that we've got our priorities out of sync.
p400
aVWe're not matching our resources to our priorities.
p401
aVBecause if what we're interested in is terrorism,
p402
aVPakistan is far more important than Afghanistan.
p403
aVIf what we're interested in is regional stability,
p404
aVEgypt is far more important.
p405
aVIf what we're worried about is poverty and development,
p406
aVsub-Saharan Africa is far more important.
p407
aVThis doesn't mean that Afghanistan doesn't matter,
p408
aVbut that it's one of 40 countries in the world
p409
aVwith which we need to engage.
p410
aa(lp411
VSo if I can finish with a metaphor for intervention,
p412
aVwhat we need to think of
p413
aVis something like mountain rescue.
p414
aVWhy mountain rescue?
p415
aVBecause when people talk about intervention,
p416
aVthey imagine that some scientific theory \u2014
p417
aVthe Rand Corporation goes around
p418
aVcounting 43 previous insurgencies
p419
aVproducing mathematical formula
p420
aVsaying you need one trained counter-insurgent
p421
aVfor every 20 members of the population.
p422
aVThis is the wrong way of looking at it.
p423
aVYou need to look at it in the way that you look at mountain rescue.
p424
aa(lp425
VWhen you're doing mountain rescue,
p426
aVyou don't take a doctorate in mountain rescue,
p427
aVyou look for somebody who knows the terrain.
p428
aVIt's about context.
p429
aVYou understand that you can prepare,
p430
aVbut the amount of preparation you can do
p431
aVis limited \u2014
p432
aVyou can take some water, you can have a map,
p433
aVyou can have a pack.
p434
aVBut what really matters
p435
aVis two kinds of problems \u2014
p436
aVproblems that occur on the mountain
p437
aVwhich you couldn't anticipate,
p438
aVsuch as, for example, ice on a slope,
p439
aVbut which you can get around,
p440
aVand problems which you couldn't anticipate
p441
aVand which you can't get around,
p442
aVlike a sudden blizzard or an avalanche
p443
aVor a change in the weather.
p444
aa(lp445
VAnd the key to this
p446
aVis a guide who has been on that mountain,
p447
aVin every temperature,
p448
aVat every period \u2014
p449
aVa guide who, above all,
p450
aVknows when to turn back,
p451
aVwho doesn't press on relentlessly
p452
aVwhen conditions turn against them.
p453
aVWhat we look for
p454
aVin firemen, in climbers, in policemen,
p455
aVand what we should look for in intervention,
p456
aVis intelligent risk takers \u2014
p457
aVnot people who plunge blind off a cliff,
p458
aVnot people who jump into a burning room,
p459
aVbut who weigh their risks,
p460
aVweigh their responsibilities.
p461
aVBecause the worst thing we have done in Afghanistan
p462
aVis this idea
p463
aVthat failure is not an option.
p464
aVIt makes failure invisible,
p465
aVinconceivable and inevitable.
p466
aVAnd if we can resist
p467
aVthis crazy slogan,
p468
aVwe shall discover \u2014
p469
aVin Egypt, in Syria, in Libya,
p470
aVand anywhere else we go in the world \u2014
p471
aVthat if we can often do much less than we pretend,
p472
aVwe can do much more than we fear.
p473
aa(lp474
VThank you very much.
p475
aa(lp476
V(Applause)
p477
aa(lp478
VThank you. Thank you very much.
p479

aVis that we are always pushing for the black or white.
p497
aVWe imagine there are only two choices:
p498

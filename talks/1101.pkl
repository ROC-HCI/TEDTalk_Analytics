VI was only four years old
p5
aVwhen I saw my mother load a washing machine
p6
aVfor the very first time in her life.
p7
aVThat was a great day for my mother.
p8
aVMy mother and father had been saving money for years
p9
aVto be able to buy that machine,
p10
aVand the first day it was going to be used,
p11
aVeven Grandma was invited
p12
aVto see the machine.
p13
aVAnd Grandma was even more excited.
p14
aVThroughout her life
p15
aVshe had been heating water with firewood,
p16
aVand she had hand washed laundry
p17
aVfor seven children.
p18
aVAnd now she was going to watch
p19
aVelectricity do that work.
p20
aa(lp21
VMy mother carefully opened the door,
p22
aVand she loaded the laundry
p23
aVinto the machine,
p24
aVlike this.
p25
aVAnd then, when she closed the door,
p26
aVGrandma said, "No, no, no, no.
p27
aVLet me, let me push the button."
p28
aVAnd Grandma pushed the button,
p29
aVand she said, "Oh, fantastic!
p30
aVI want to see this! Give me a chair!
p31
aVGive me a chair! I want to see it,"
p32
aVand she sat down in front of the machine,
p33
aVand she watched the entire washing program.
p34
aVShe was mesmerized.
p35
aVTo my grandmother,
p36
aVthe washing machine was a miracle.
p37
aa(lp38
VToday, in Sweden and other rich countries,
p39
aVpeople are using
p40
aVso many different machines.
p41
aVLook, the homes are full of machines.
p42
aVI can't even name them all.
p43
aVAnd they also, when they want to travel,
p44
aVthey use flying machines
p45
aVthat can take them to remote destinations.
p46
aVAnd yet, in the world, there are so many people
p47
aVwho still heat the water on fire,
p48
aVand they cook their food on fire.
p49
aVSometimes they don't even have enough food,
p50
aVand they live below the poverty line.
p51
aVThere are two billion fellow human beings
p52
aVwho live on less than two dollars a day.
p53
aVAnd the richest people over there \u2014
p54
aVthere's one billion people \u2014
p55
aVand they live above what I call the "air line,"
p56
aVbecause they spend more than $80 a day
p57
aVon their consumption.
p58
aa(lp59
VBut this is just one, two, three billion people,
p60
aVand obviously there are seven billion people in the world,
p61
aVso there must be one, two, three, four billion people more
p62
aVwho live in between the poverty and the air line.
p63
aVThey have electricity,
p64
aVbut the question is, how many have washing machines?
p65
aVI've done the scrutiny of market data,
p66
aVand I've found that, indeed,
p67
aVthe washing machine has penetrated below the air line,
p68
aVand today there's an additional one billion people out there
p69
aVwho live above the "wash line."
p70
aV(Laughter)
p71
aVAnd they consume more than $40 per day.
p72
aVSo two billion have access to washing machines.
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd the remaining five billion,
p75
aVhow do they wash?
p76
aVOr, to be more precise,
p77
aVhow do most of the women in the world wash?
p78
aVBecause it remains hard work for women to wash.
p79
aVThey wash like this: by hand.
p80
aVIt's a hard, time-consuming labor,
p81
aVwhich they have to do for hours every week.
p82
aVAnd sometimes they also have to bring water from far away
p83
aVto do the laundry at home,
p84
aVor they have to bring the laundry away to a stream far off.
p85
aVAnd they want the washing machine.
p86
aVThey don't want to spend such a large part of their life
p87
aVdoing this hard work
p88
aVwith so relatively low productivity.
p89
aVAnd there's nothing different in their wish
p90
aVthan it was for my grandma.
p91
aVLook here, two generations ago in Sweden \u2014
p92
aVpicking water from the stream,
p93
aVheating with firewood and washing like that.
p94
aVThey want the washing machine in exactly the same way.
p95
aa(lp96
VBut when I lecture to environmentally-concerned students,
p97
aVthey tell me, "No, everybody in the world cannot have cars and washing machines."
p98
aVHow can we tell this woman
p99
aVthat she ain't going to have a washing machine?
p100
aVAnd then I ask my students,
p101
aVI've asked them \u2014 over the last two years I've asked,
p102
aV"How many of you doesn't use a car?"
p103
aVAnd some of them proudly raise their hand
p104
aVand say, "I don't use a car."
p105
aVAnd then I put the really tough question:
p106
aV"How many of you
p107
aVhand-wash your jeans and your bed sheets?"
p108
aVAnd no one raised their hand.
p109
aVEven the hardcore in the green movement
p110
aVuse washing machines.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VSo how come [this is] something that everyone uses
p115
aVand they think others will not stop it? What is special with this?
p116
aVI had to do an analysis about the energy used in the world.
p117
aVHere we are.
p118
aVLook here, you see the seven billion people up there:
p119
aVthe air people, the wash people,
p120
aVthe bulb people and the fire people.
p121
aVOne unit like this
p122
aVis an energy unit of fossil fuel \u2014
p123
aVoil, coal or gas.
p124
aVThat's what most of electricity and the energy in the world is.
p125
aVAnd it's 12 units used in the entire world,
p126
aVand the richest one billion, they use six of them.
p127
aVHalf of the energy is used by one seventh of the world's population.
p128
aVAnd these ones who have washing machines,
p129
aVbut not a house full of other machines,
p130
aVthey use two.
p131
aVThis group uses three, one each.
p132
aVAnd they also have electricity.
p133
aVAnd over there they don't even use one each.
p134
aVThat makes 12 of them.
p135
aa(lp136
VBut the main concern
p137
aVfor the environmentally-interested students \u2014 and they are right \u2014
p138
aVis about the future.
p139
aVWhat are the trends? If we just prolong the trends,
p140
aVwithout any real advanced analysis, to 2050,
p141
aVthere are two things that can increase the energy use.
p142
aVFirst, population growth.
p143
aVSecond, economic growth.
p144
aVPopulation growth will mainly occur among the poorest people here
p145
aVbecause they have high child mortality
p146
aVand they have many children per woman.
p147
aVAnd [with] that you will get two extra,
p148
aVbut that won't change the energy use very much.
p149
aa(lp150
VWhat will happen is economic growth.
p151
aVThe best of here in the emerging economies \u2014
p152
aVI call them the New East \u2014
p153
aVthey will jump the air line.
p154
aV"Wopp!" they will say.
p155
aVAnd they will start to use as much as the Old West are doing already.
p156
aVAnd these people, they want the washing machine.
p157
aVI told you. They'll go there.
p158
aVAnd they will double their energy use.
p159
aVAnd we hope that the poor people will get into the electric light.
p160
aVAnd they'll get a two-child family without a stop in population growth.
p161
aVBut the total energy consumption
p162
aVwill increase to 22 units.
p163
aVAnd these 22 units \u2014
p164
aVstill the richest people use most of it.
p165
aVSo what needs to be done?
p166
aVBecause the risk,
p167
aVthe high probability of climate change is real.
p168
aVIt's real.
p169
aVOf course they must be more energy-efficient.
p170
aVThey must change behavior in some way.
p171
aVThey must also start to produce green energy,
p172
aVmuch more green energy.
p173
aVBut until they have the same energy consumption per person,
p174
aVthey shouldn't give advice to others \u2014
p175
aVwhat to do and what not to do.
p176
aV(Applause)
p177
aVHere we can get more green energy all over.
p178
aa(lp179
VThis is what we hope may happen.
p180
aVIt's a real challenge in the future.
p181
aVBut I can assure you that this woman in the favela in Rio,
p182
aVshe wants a washing machine.
p183
aVShe's very happy about her minister of energy
p184
aVthat provided electricity to everyone \u2014
p185
aVso happy that she even voted for her.
p186
aVAnd she became Dilma Rousseff,
p187
aVthe president-elect
p188
aVof one of the biggest democracies in the world \u2014
p189
aVmoving from minister of energy to president.
p190
aVIf you have democracy,
p191
aVpeople will vote for washing machines.
p192
aVThey love them.
p193
aa(lp194
VAnd what's the magic with them?
p195
aVMy mother explained the magic with this machine
p196
aVthe very, very first day.
p197
aVShe said, "Now Hans,
p198
aVwe have loaded the laundry.
p199
aVThe machine will make the work.
p200
aVAnd now we can go to the library."
p201
aVBecause this is the magic:
p202
aVyou load the laundry,
p203
aVand what do you get out of the machine?
p204
aVYou get books out of the machines,
p205
aVchildren's books.
p206
aVAnd mother got time to read for me.
p207
aVShe loved this. I got the "ABC's" \u2014
p208
aVthis is where I started my career as a professor,
p209
aVwhen my mother had time to read for me.
p210
aVAnd she also got books for herself.
p211
aVShe managed to study English
p212
aVand learn that as a foreign language.
p213
aVAnd she read so many novels,
p214
aVso many different novels here.
p215
aVAnd we really, we really loved this machine.
p216
aa(lp217
VAnd what we said, my mother and me,
p218
aV"Thank you industrialization.
p219
aVThank you steel mill.
p220
aVThank you power station.
p221
aVAnd thank you chemical processing industry
p222
aVthat gave us time to read books."
p223
aa(lp224
VThank you very much.

A professor of global health at Sweden&#39;s <a href=\\"http://ki.se/ki/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=130&amp;l=en\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Karolinska Institute</a>, his current work focuses on dispelling common myths about the so-called developing world, which (he points out) is no longer worlds away from the West. In fact, most of the Third World is on the same trajectory toward health and prosperity, and many countries are moving twice as fast as the west did.<br /><br />What sets Rosling apart isn&#39;t just his apt observations of broad social and economic trends, but the stunning way he presents them. Guaranteed: You&#39;ve never seen data presented like this. By any logic, a presentation that tracks global health and poverty trends should be, in a word: boring. But in Rosling&#39;s hands, data sings. Trends come to life. And the big picture &mdash; usually hazy at best &mdash; snaps into sharp focus. <br /><br />Rosling&#39;s presentations are grounded in solid statistics (often drawn from United Nations data), illustrated by the visualization software he developed. The animations transform development statistics into moving bubbles and flowing curves that make global trends clear, intuitive and even playful. During his legendary presentations, Rosling takes this one step farther, narrating the animations with a sportscaster&#39;s flair. <br /><br />Rosling developed the breakthrough software behind his visualizations through his nonprofit <a href=\\"http://www.gapminder.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Gapminder</a>, founded with his son and daughter-in-law. The free software &mdash; which can be loaded with any data &mdash; was purchased by Google in March 2007. (Rosling met the Google founders at TED.)<br /><br />Rosling began his wide-ranging career as a physician, spending many years in rural Africa tracking a rare paralytic disease (which he named konzo) and discovering its cause: hunger and badly processed cassava. He co-founded M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;rs (Doctors without Borders) Sweden, wrote a textbook on global health, and as a professor at the Karolinska Institut in Stockholm initiated key international research collaborations. He&#39;s also personally argued with many heads of state, including Fidel Castro. <br /><br />As if all this weren&#39;t enough, the irrepressible Rosling is also an accomplished sword-swallower &mdash; a skill he demonstrated at TED2007.<br /><br /><br /> </p>", "slug": "hans_rosling", "whotheyare": "In Hans Rosling\\u2019s hands, data sings.

worldly and well-traveled among us will have their perspectives shifted by Hans Rosling. A professor of global health at Sweden&#39;s <a href=\\"http://ki.se/ki/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=130&amp;l=en\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Karolinska Institute</a>, his current work focuses on dispelling common myths about the so-called developing world, which (he points out) is no longer worlds away from the West. In fact, most of the Third World is on the same trajectory toward health and prosperity, and many countries are moving twice as fast as the west did.<br /><br />What sets Rosling apart isn&#39;t just his apt observations of broad social and economic trends, but the stunning way he presents them. Guaranteed: You&#39;ve never seen data presented like this. By any logic, a presentation that tracks global health and poverty trends should be, in a word: boring. But in Rosling&#39;s hands, data sings. Trends come to life. And the big picture &mdash; usually hazy at best &mdash; snaps into sharp focus. <br /><br />Rosling&#39;s presentations are grounded in solid statistics (often drawn from United Nations data), illustrated by the visualization software he developed. The animations transform development statistics into moving bubbles and flowing curves that make global trends clear, intuitive and even playful. During his legendary presentations, Rosling takes this one step farther, narrating the animations with a sportscaster&#39;s flair. <br /><br />Rosling developed the breakthrough software behind his visualizations through his nonprofit <a href=\\"http://www.gapminder.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Gapminder</a>, founded with his son and daughter-in-law. The free software &mdash; which can be loaded with any data &mdash; was purchased by Google in March 2007. (Rosling met the Google founders at TED.)<br /><br />Rosling began his wide-ranging career as a physician, spending many years in rural Africa tracking a rare paralytic disease (which he named konzo) and discovering its cause: hunger and badly processed cassava. He co-founded M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;rs (Doctors without Borders) Sweden, wrote a textbook on global health, and as a professor at the Karolinska Institut in Stockholm initiated key international research collaborations. He&#39;s also personally argued with many heads of state, including Fidel Castro. <br /><br />As if all this weren&#39;t enough, the irrepressible Rosling is also an accomplished sword-swallower &mdash; a skill he demonstrated at TED2007.<br /><br /><br /> </p>", "slug": "hans_rosling", "whotheyare": "In Hans Rosling\\u2019s hands, data sings.

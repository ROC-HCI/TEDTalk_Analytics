VAll human life,
p5
aVall life, depends on plants.
p6
aVLet me try to convince you of that in a few seconds.
p7
aVJust think for a moment.
p8
aVIt doesn't matter whether you live in a small African village,
p9
aVor you live in a big city,
p10
aVeverything comes back to plants in the end:
p11
aVwhether it's for the food, the medicine,
p12
aVthe fuel, the construction, the clothing, all the obvious things;
p13
aVor whether it's for the spiritual and recreational things
p14
aVthat matter to us so much;
p15
aVor whether it's soil formation,
p16
aVor the effect on the atmosphere,
p17
aVor primary production.
p18
aVDamn it, even the books here are made out of plants.
p19
aVAll these things, they come back to plants.
p20
aVAnd without them we wouldn't be here.
p21
aa(lp22
VNow plants are under threat.
p23
aVThey're under threat because of changing climate.
p24
aVAnd they are also under threat because they are sharing a planet
p25
aVwith people like us.
p26
aVAnd people like us want to do things that destroy plants,
p27
aVand their habitats.
p28
aVAnd whether that's because of food production,
p29
aVor because of the introduction of alien plants
p30
aVinto places that they really oughtn't be,
p31
aVor because of habitats being used for other purposes \u2014
p32
aVall these things are meaning that plants have to adapt,
p33
aVor die, or move.
p34
aVAnd plants sometimes find it rather difficult to move
p35
aVbecause there might be cities and other things in the way.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo if all human life depends on plants,
p38
aVdoesn't it make sense that perhaps we should try to save them?
p39
aVI think it does.
p40
aVAnd I want to tell you about a project to save plants.
p41
aVAnd the way that you save plants
p42
aVis by storing seeds.
p43
aVBecause seeds, in all their diverse glory,
p44
aVare plants' futures.
p45
aVAll the genetic information for future generations of plants
p46
aVare held in seeds.
p47
aVSo here is the building;
p48
aVit looks rather unassuming, really.
p49
aVBut it goes down below ground many stories.
p50
aVAnd it's the largest seed bank in the world.
p51
aVIt exists not only in southern England,
p52
aVbut distributed around the world. I'll come to that.
p53
aVThis is a nuclear-proof facility.
p54
aVGod forbid that it should have to withstand that.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo if you're going to build a seed bank, you have to decide
p57
aVwhat you're going to store in it. Right?
p58
aVAnd we decided that what we want to store first of all,
p59
aVare the species that are most under threat.
p60
aVAnd those are the dry land species.
p61
aVSo first of all we did deals
p62
aVwith 50 different countries.
p63
aVIt means negotiating with heads of state,
p64
aVand with secretaries of state in 50 countries
p65
aVto sign treaties.
p66
aVWe have 120 partner institutions all over the world,
p67
aVin all those countries colored orange.
p68
aVPeople come from all over the world to learn,
p69
aVand then they go away and plan exactly how
p70
aVthey're going to collect these seeds.
p71
aVThey have thousands of people all over the world
p72
aVtagging places where those plants are said to exist.
p73
aVThey search for them. They find them in flower.
p74
aVAnd they go back when their seeds have arrived.
p75
aVAnd they collect the seeds. All over the world.
p76
aa(lp77
VThe seeds \u2014 some of if is very untechnical.
p78
aVYou kind of shovel them all in to bags and dry them off.
p79
aVYou label them. You do some high-tech things here and there,
p80
aVsome low-tech things here and there.
p81
aVAnd the main thing is that you have to dry them
p82
aVvery carefully, at low temperature.
p83
aVAnd then you have to store them
p84
aVat about minus 20 degrees C \u2014
p85
aVthat's about minus four Fahrenheit, I think \u2014
p86
aVwith a very critically low moisture content.
p87
aVAnd these seeds will be able to germinate,
p88
aVwe believe, with many of the species,
p89
aVin thousands of years,
p90
aVand certainly in hundreds of years.
p91
aa(lp92
VIt's no good storing the seeds if you don't know they're still viable.
p93
aVSo every 10 years we do germination tests
p94
aVon every sample of seeds that we have.
p95
aVAnd this is a distributed network.
p96
aVSo all around the world people are doing the same thing.
p97
aVAnd that enables us to develop germination protocols.
p98
aVThat means that we know the right combination of heat
p99
aVand cold and the cycles that you have to get
p100
aVto make the seed germinate.
p101
aVAnd that is very useful information.
p102
aVAnd then we grow these things,
p103
aVand we tell people, back in the countries where these seeds have come from,
p104
aV"Look, actually we're not just storing this
p105
aVto get the seeds later,
p106
aVbut we can give you this information about
p107
aVhow to germinate these difficult plants."
p108
aVAnd that's already happening.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo where have we got to?
p111
aVI am pleased to unveil that our three billionth seed \u2014
p112
aVthat's three thousand millionth seed \u2014
p113
aVis now stored.
p114
aVTen percent of all plant species on the planet,
p115
aV24,000 species are safe;
p116
aV30,000 species, if we get the funding, by next year.
p117
aVTwenty-five percent of all the world's plants, by 2020.
p118
aVThese are not just crop plants,
p119
aVas you might have seen stored in Svalbard in Norway \u2014
p120
aVfantastic work there.
p121
aVThis is at least 100 times bigger.
p122
aVWe have thousands of collections that have been sent out
p123
aVall over the world:
p124
aVdrought-tolerant forest species sent to Pakistan and Egypt;
p125
aVespecially photosynthetic-efficient plants
p126
aVcome here to the United States;
p127
aVsalt-tolerant pasture species sent to Australia;
p128
aVthe list goes on and on.
p129
aa(lp130
VThese seeds are used for restoration.
p131
aVSo in habitats that have already been damaged,
p132
aVlike the tall grass prairie here in the USA,
p133
aVor in mined land in various countries,
p134
aVrestoration is already happening because of these species \u2014
p135
aVand because of this collection.
p136
aVSome of these plants, like the ones on the bottom
p137
aVto the left of your screen,
p138
aVthey are down to the last few remaining members.
p139
aVThe one where the guy is collecting seeds there on the truck,
p140
aVthat is down to about 30 last remaining trees.
p141
aVFantastically useful plant,
p142
aVboth for protein and for medicine.
p143
aa(lp144
VWe have training going on in China, in the USA,
p145
aVand many other countries.
p146
aVHow much does it cost?
p147
aV2,800 dollars per species is the average.
p148
aVI think that's cheap, at the price.
p149
aVAnd that gets you all the scientific data
p150
aVthat goes with it.
p151
aVThe future research is "How can we find
p152
aVthe genetic and molecular markers
p153
aVfor the viability of seeds,
p154
aVwithout having to plant them every 10 years?"
p155
aVAnd we're almost there.
p156
aVThank you very much.

aV(Applause)

VMany believe driving is an activity
p5
aVsolely reserved for those who can see.
p6
aVA blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently
p7
aVwas thought to be an impossible task, until now.
p8
aVHello, my name is Dennis Hong,
p9
aVand we're bringing freedom and independence to the blind
p10
aVby building a vehicle for the visually impaired.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo before I talk about this car for the blind,
p13
aVlet me briefly tell you about another project that I worked on
p14
aVcalled the DARPA Urban Challenge.
p15
aVNow this was about building a robotic car
p16
aVthat can drive itself.
p17
aVYou press start, nobody touches anything,
p18
aVand it can reach its destination fully autonomously.
p19
aVSo in 2007, our team won half a million dollars
p20
aVby placing third place in this competition.
p21
aVSo about that time,
p22
aVthe National Federation of the Blind, or NFB,
p23
aVchallenged the research committee
p24
aVabout who can develop a car
p25
aVthat lets a blind person drive safely and independently.
p26
aVWe decided to give it a try,
p27
aVbecause we thought, "Hey, how hard could it be?"
p28
aVWe have already an autonomous vehicle.
p29
aVWe just put a blind person in it and we're done, right?
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aVWe couldn't have been more wrong.
p32
aVWhat NFB wanted
p33
aVwas not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around,
p34
aVbut a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive.
p35
aVSo we had to throw everything out the window
p36
aVand start from scratch.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo to test this crazy idea,
p39
aVwe developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle
p40
aVto test the feasibility.
p41
aVAnd in the summer of 2009,
p42
aVwe invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country
p43
aVand gave them a chance to take it for a spin.
p44
aVIt was an absolutely amazing experience.
p45
aVBut the problem with this car was
p46
aVit was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment,
p47
aVin a flat, closed-off parking lot \u2014
p48
aVeven the lanes defined by red traffic cones.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo with this success,
p51
aVwe decided to take the next big step,
p52
aVto develop a real car that can be driven on real roads.
p53
aVSo how does it work?
p54
aVWell, it's a rather complex system,
p55
aVbut let me try to explain it, maybe simplify it.
p56
aVSo we have three steps.
p57
aVWe have perception, computation
p58
aVand non-visual interfaces.
p59
aVNow obviously the driver cannot see,
p60
aVso the system needs to perceive the environment
p61
aVand gather information for the driver.
p62
aVFor that, we use an initial measurement unit.
p63
aVSo it measures acceleration, angular acceleration \u2014
p64
aVlike a human ear, inner ear.
p65
aVWe fuse that information with a GPS unit
p66
aVto get an estimate of the location of the car.
p67
aVWe also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road.
p68
aVAnd we also use three laser range finders.
p69
aVThe lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles \u2014
p70
aVa car approaching from the front, the back
p71
aVand also any obstacles that run into the roads,
p72
aVany obstacles around the vehicle.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer,
p75
aVand the computer can do two things.
p76
aVOne is, first of all, process this information
p77
aVto have an understanding of the environment \u2014
p78
aVthese are the lanes of the road, there's the obstacles \u2014
p79
aVand convey this information to the driver.
p80
aVThe system is also smart enough
p81
aVto figure out the safest way to operate the car.
p82
aVSo we can also generate instructions
p83
aVon how to operate the controls of the vehicle.
p84
aVBut the problem is this: How do we convey
p85
aVthis information and instructions
p86
aVto a person who cannot see
p87
aVfast enough and accurate enough so he can drive?
p88
aVSo for this, we developed many different types
p89
aVof non-visual user interface technology.
p90
aVSo starting from a three-dimensional ping sound system,
p91
aVa vibrating vest,
p92
aVa click wheel with voice commands, a leg strip,
p93
aVeven a shoe that applies pressure to the foot.
p94
aVBut today we're going to talk about
p95
aVthree of these non-visual user interfaces.
p96
aa(lp97
VNow the first interface is called a DriveGrip.
p98
aVSo these are a pair of gloves,
p99
aVand it has vibrating elements on the knuckle part
p100
aVso you can convey instructions about how to steer \u2014
p101
aVthe direction and the intensity.
p102
aVAnother device is called SpeedStrip.
p103
aVSo this is a chair \u2014 as a matter of fact, it's actually a massage chair.
p104
aVWe gut it out, and we rearrange the vibrating elements in different patterns,
p105
aVand we actuate them to convey information about the speed,
p106
aVand also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal.
p107
aVSo over here, you can see
p108
aVhow the computer understands the environment,
p109
aVand because you cannot see the vibration,
p110
aVwe actually put red LED's on the driver so that you can see what's happening.
p111
aVThis is the sensory data,
p112
aVand that data is transferred to the devices through the computer.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedStrip,
p115
aVare very effective.
p116
aVBut the problem is
p117
aVthese are instructional cue devices.
p118
aVSo this is not really freedom, right?
p119
aVThe computer tells you how to drive \u2014
p120
aVturn left, turn right, speed up, stop.
p121
aVWe call this the "backseat-driver problem."
p122
aVSo we're moving away from the instructional cue devices,
p123
aVand we're now focusing more
p124
aVon the informational devices.
p125
aVA good example for this informational non-visual user interface
p126
aVis called AirPix.
p127
aVSo think of it as a monitor for the blind.
p128
aVSo it's a small tablet, has many holes in it,
p129
aVand compressed air comes out,
p130
aVso it can actually draw images.
p131
aVSo even though you are blind, you can put your hand over it,
p132
aVyou can see the lanes of the road and obstacles.
p133
aVActually, you can also change the frequency of the air coming out
p134
aVand possibly the temperature.
p135
aVSo it's actually a multi-dimensional user interface.
p136
aVSo here you can see the left camera, the right camera from the vehicle
p137
aVand how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the AirPix.
p138
aVFor this, we're showing a simulator,
p139
aVa blind person driving using the AirPix.
p140
aVThis simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers
p141
aVand also quickly testing different types of ideas
p142
aVfor different types of non-visual user interfaces.
p143
aVSo basically that's how it works.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo just a month ago,
p146
aVon January 29th,
p147
aVwe unveiled this vehicle for the very first time to the public
p148
aVat the world-famous Daytona International Speedway
p149
aVduring the Rolex 24 racing event.
p150
aVWe also had some surprises. Let's take a look.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Music)
p153
aa(lp154
V(Video) Announcer: This is an historic day in January.
p155
aVHe's coming up to the grandstand, fellow Federationists.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Cheering)
p158
aa(lp159
V(Honking)
p160
aa(lp161
VThere's the grandstand now.
p162
aVAnd he's [unclear] following that van that's out in front of him.
p163
aVWell there comes the first box.
p164
aVNow let's see if Mark avoids it.
p165
aVHe does. He passes it on the right.
p166
aVThird box is out. The fourth box is out.
p167
aVAnd he's perfectly making his way between the two.
p168
aVHe's closing in on the van
p169
aVto make the moving pass.
p170
aVWell this is what it's all about,
p171
aVthis kind of dynamic display of audacity and ingenuity.
p172
aVHe's approaching the end of the run,
p173
aVmakes his way between the barrels that are set up there.
p174
aa(lp175
V(Honking)
p176
aa(lp177
V(Applause)
p178
aa(lp179
VDennis Hong: I'm so happy for you.
p180
aVMark's going to give me a ride back to the hotel.
p181
aa(lp182
VMark Riccobono: Yes.
p183
aa(lp184
V(Applause)
p185
aa(lp186
VDH: So since we started this project,
p187
aVwe've been getting hundreds of letters, emails, phone calls
p188
aVfrom people from all around the world.
p189
aVLetters thanking us, but sometimes you also get funny letters like this one:
p190
aV"Now I understand why there is Braille on a drive-up ATM machine."
p191
aV(Laughter)
p192
aVBut sometimes \u2014
p193
aV(Laughter)
p194
aVBut sometimes I also do get \u2014
p195
aVI wouldn't call it hate mail \u2014
p196
aVbut letters of really strong concern:
p197
aV"Dr. Hong, are you insane,
p198
aVtrying to put blind people on the road?
p199
aVYou must be out of your mind."
p200
aVBut this vehicle is a prototype vehicle,
p201
aVand it's not going to be on the road
p202
aVuntil it's proven as safe as, or safer than, today's vehicle.
p203
aVAnd I truly believe that this can happen.
p204
aa(lp205
VBut still, will the society,
p206
aVwould they accept such a radical idea?
p207
aVHow are we going to handle insurance?
p208
aVHow are we going to issue driver's licenses?
p209
aVThere's many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges
p210
aVthat we need to address before this becomes a reality.
p211
aVOf course, the main goal of this project
p212
aVis to develop a car for the blind.
p213
aVBut potentially more important than this
p214
aVis the tremendous value of the spin-off technology
p215
aVthat can come from this project.
p216
aVThe sensors that are used can see through the dark,
p217
aVthe fog and rain.
p218
aVAnd together with this new type of interfaces,
p219
aVwe can use these technologies
p220
aVand apply them to safer cars for sighted people.
p221
aVOr for the blind, everyday home appliances \u2014
p222
aVin the educational setting, in the office setting.
p223
aVJust imagine, in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard
p224
aVand a blind student can see what's written and read
p225
aVusing these non-visual interfaces.
p226
aVThis is priceless.
p227
aVSo today, the things I've showed you today, is just the beginning.
p228
aa(lp229
VThank you very much.

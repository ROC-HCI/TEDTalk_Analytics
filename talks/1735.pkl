VIn this talk today, I want to present a different idea
p5
aVfor why investing in early childhood education
p6
aVmakes sense as a public investment.
p7
aVIt's a different idea, because usually,
p8
aVwhen people talk about early childhood programs,
p9
aVthey talk about all the wonderful benefits for participants
p10
aVin terms of former participants, in preschool,
p11
aVthey have better K-12 test scores,
p12
aVbetter adult earnings.
p13
aVNow that's all very important,
p14
aVbut what I want to talk about is what preschool does
p15
aVfor state economies
p16
aVand for promoting state economic development.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd that's actually crucial
p19
aVbecause if we're going to get increased investment
p20
aVin early childhood programs,
p21
aVwe need to interest state governments in this.
p22
aVThe federal government has a lot on its plate,
p23
aVand state governments are going to have to step up.
p24
aVSo we have to appeal to them,
p25
aVthe legislators in the state government,
p26
aVand turn to something they understand,
p27
aVthat they have to promote the economic development
p28
aVof their state economy.
p29
aVNow, by promoting economic development,
p30
aVI don't mean anything magical.
p31
aVAll I mean is, is that early childhood education
p32
aVcan bring more and better jobs to a state
p33
aVand can thereby promote higher per capita earnings
p34
aVfor the state's residents.
p35
aa(lp36
VNow, I think it's fair to say that when people think about
p37
aVstate and local economic development,
p38
aVthey don't generally think first about what they're doing
p39
aVabout childcare and early childhood programs.
p40
aVI know this. I've spent most of my career researching these programs.
p41
aVI've talked to a lot of directors
p42
aVof state economic development agencies about these issues,
p43
aVa lot of legislators about these issues.
p44
aVWhen legislators and others think about economic development,
p45
aVwhat they first of all think about are business tax incentives,
p46
aVproperty tax abatements, job creation tax credits,
p47
aVyou know, there are a million of these programs all over the place.
p48
aVSo for example, states compete very vigorously
p49
aVto attract new auto plants or expanded auto plants.
p50
aVThey hand out all kinds of business tax breaks.
p51
aVNow, those programs can make sense
p52
aVif they in fact induce new location decisions,
p53
aVand the way they can make sense is,
p54
aVby creating more and better jobs,
p55
aVthey raise employment rates, raise per capita earnings of state residents.
p56
aVSo there is a benefit to state residents
p57
aVthat corresponds to the costs that they're paying
p58
aVby paying for these business tax breaks.
p59
aa(lp60
VMy argument is essentially that early childhood programs
p61
aVcan do exactly the same thing,
p62
aVcreate more and better jobs, but in a different way.
p63
aVIt's a somewhat more indirect way.
p64
aVThese programs can promote more and better jobs by,
p65
aVyou build it, you invest in high-quality preschool,
p66
aVit develops the skills of your local workforce
p67
aVif enough of them stick around, and, in turn,
p68
aVthat higher-quality local workforce
p69
aVwill be a key driver of creating jobs and creating
p70
aVhigher earnings per capita in the local community.
p71
aa(lp72
VNow, let me turn to some numbers on this.
p73
aVOkay. If you look at the research evidence \u2014
p74
aVthat's extensive \u2014 on how much early childhood programs
p75
aVaffect the educational attainment, wages and skills
p76
aVof former participants in preschool as adults,
p77
aVyou take those known effects,
p78
aVyou take how many of those folks will be expected
p79
aVto stick around the state or local economy and not move out,
p80
aVand you take research on how much skills
p81
aVdrive job creation, you will conclude,
p82
aVfrom these three separate lines of research,
p83
aVthat for every dollar invested in early childhood programs,
p84
aVthe per capita earnings of state residents
p85
aVgo up by two dollars and 78 cents,
p86
aVso that's a three-to-one return.
p87
aVNow you can get much higher returns,
p88
aVof up to 16-to-one, if you include anti-crime benefits,
p89
aVif you include benefits to former preschool participants
p90
aVwho move to some other state,
p91
aVbut there's a good reason for focusing on these three dollars
p92
aVbecause this is salient and important
p93
aVto state legislators and state policy makers,
p94
aVand it's the states that are going to have to act.
p95
aVSo there is this key benefit that is relevant
p96
aVto state policy makers in terms of economic development.
p97
aa(lp98
VNow, one objection you often hear,
p99
aVor maybe you don't hear it because people are too polite to say it, is,
p100
aVwhy should I pay more taxes
p101
aVto invest in other people's children?
p102
aVWhat's in it for me?
p103
aVAnd the trouble with that objection,
p104
aVit reflects a total misunderstanding
p105
aVof how much local economies
p106
aVinvolve everyone being interdependent.
p107
aVSpecifically, the interdependency here is, is that
p108
aVthere are huge spillovers of skills \u2014
p109
aVthat when other people's children get more skills,
p110
aVthat actually increases the prosperity of everyone,
p111
aVincluding people whose skills don't change.
p112
aVSo for example, numerous research studies have shown
p113
aVif you look at what really drives
p114
aVthe growth rate of metropolitan areas,
p115
aVit's not so much low taxes, low cost, low wages;
p116
aVit's the skills of the area. Particularly, the proxy for skills
p117
aVthat people use is percentage of college graduates in the area.
p118
aVSo when you look, for example, at metropolitan areas
p119
aVsuch as the Boston area, Minneapolis-St. Paul,
p120
aVSilicon Valley, these areas are not doing well economically
p121
aVbecause they're low-cost.
p122
aVI don't know if you ever tried to buy a house in Silicon Valley.
p123
aVIt's not exactly a low-cost proposition.
p124
aVThey are growing because they have high levels of skills.
p125
aVSo when we invest in other people's children,
p126
aVand build up those skills, we increase the overall job growth
p127
aVof a metro area.
p128
aVAs another example, if we look
p129
aVat what determines an individual's wages,
p130
aVand we do statistical exploration of that, what determines wages,
p131
aVwe know that the individual's wages will depend, in part,
p132
aVon that individual's education,
p133
aVfor example whether or not they have a college degree.
p134
aVOne of the very interesting facts is that, in addition,
p135
aVwe find that even once we hold constant, statistically,
p136
aVthe effect of your own education,
p137
aVthe education of everyone else in your metropolitan area
p138
aValso affects your wages.
p139
aVSo specifically, if you hold constant your education,
p140
aVyou stick in percentage of college graduates in your metro area,
p141
aVyou will find that has a significant positive effect on your wages
p142
aVwithout changing your education at all.
p143
aVIn fact, this effect is so strong
p144
aVthat when someone gets a college degree,
p145
aVthe spillover effects of this on the wages
p146
aVof others in the metropolitan area
p147
aVare actually greater than the direct effects.
p148
aVSo if someone gets a college degree, their lifetime earnings
p149
aVgo up by a huge amount, over 700,000 dollars.
p150
aVThere's an effect on everyone else in the metro area
p151
aVof driving up the percentage of college graduates in the metro area,
p152
aVand if you add that up \u2014 it's a small effect for each person,
p153
aVbut if you add that up across all the people in the metro area,
p154
aVyou actually get that the increase in wages for everyone else
p155
aVin the metropolitan area adds up to almost a million dollars.
p156
aVThat's actually greater than the direct benefits
p157
aVof the person choosing to get education.
p158
aa(lp159
VNow, what's going on here?
p160
aVWhat can explain these huge spillover effects of education?
p161
aVWell, let's think about it this way.
p162
aVI can be the most skilled person in the world,
p163
aVbut if everyone else at my firm lacks skills,
p164
aVmy employer is going to find it more difficult
p165
aVto introduce new technology, new production techniques.
p166
aVSo as a result, my employer is going to be less productive.
p167
aVThey will not be able to afford to pay me as good wages.
p168
aVEven if everyone at my firm has good skills,
p169
aVif the workers at the suppliers to my firm
p170
aVdo not have good skills,
p171
aVmy firm is going to be less competitive
p172
aVcompeting in national and international markets.
p173
aVAnd again, the firm that's less competitive
p174
aVwill not be able to pay as good wages,
p175
aVand then, particularly in high-tech businesses,
p176
aVthey're constantly stealing ideas and workers from other businesses.
p177
aVSo clearly the productivity of firms in Silicon Valley
p178
aVhas a lot to do with the skills not only of the workers at their firm,
p179
aVbut the workers at all the other firms in the metro area.
p180
aVSo as a result, if we can invest in other people's children
p181
aVthrough preschool and other early childhood programs
p182
aVthat are high-quality, we not only help those children,
p183
aVwe help everyone in the metropolitan area
p184
aVgain in wages and we'll have the metropolitan area
p185
aVgain in job growth.
p186
aa(lp187
VAnother objection used sometimes here
p188
aVto invest in early childhood programs
p189
aVis concern about people moving out.
p190
aVSo, you know, maybe Ohio's thinking about investing
p191
aVin more preschool education
p192
aVfor children in Columbus, Ohio,
p193
aVbut they're worried that these little Buckeyes will,
p194
aVfor some strange reason, decide to move to Ann Arbor, Michigan,
p195
aVand become Wolverines.
p196
aVAnd maybe Michigan will be thinking about investing
p197
aVin preschool in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and be worried
p198
aVthese little Wolverines will end up moving to Ohio and becoming Buckeyes.
p199
aVAnd so they'll both underinvest because everyone's going to move out.
p200
aVWell, the reality is, if you look at the data,
p201
aVAmericans aren't as hyper-mobile as people sometimes assume.
p202
aVThe data is that over 60 percent of Americans
p203
aVspend most of their working careers
p204
aVin the state they were born in, over 60 percent.
p205
aVThat percentage does not vary much from state to state.
p206
aVIt doesn't vary much with the state's economy,
p207
aVwhether it's depressed or booming,
p208
aVit doesn't vary much over time.
p209
aVSo the reality is, if you invest in kids,
p210
aVthey will stay.
p211
aVOr at least, enough of them will stay
p212
aVthat it will pay off for your state economy.
p213
aa(lp214
VOkay, so to sum up, there is a lot of research evidence
p215
aVthat early childhood programs, if run in a high-quality way,
p216
aVpay off in higher adult skills.
p217
aVThere's a lot of research evidence
p218
aVthat those folks will stick around the state economy,
p219
aVand there's a lot of evidence that having more workers
p220
aVwith higher skills in your local economy
p221
aVpays off in higher wages and job growth for your local economy,
p222
aVand if you calculate the numbers for each dollar,
p223
aVwe get about three dollars back
p224
aVin benefits for the state economy.
p225
aVSo in my opinion, the research evidence is compelling
p226
aVand the logic of this is compelling.
p227
aVSo what are the barriers to getting it done?
p228
aa(lp229
VWell, one obvious barrier is cost.
p230
aVSo if you look at what it would cost
p231
aVif every state government invested
p232
aVin universal preschool at age four, full-day preschool at age four,
p233
aVthe total annual national cost would be roughly
p234
aV30 billion dollars.
p235
aVSo, 30 billion dollars is a lot of money.
p236
aVOn the other hand, if you reflect on
p237
aVthat the U.S.'s population is over 300 million,
p238
aVwe're talking about an amount of money
p239
aVthat amounts to 100 dollars per capita.
p240
aVOkay? A hundred dollars per capita, per person,
p241
aVis something that any state government can afford to do.
p242
aVIt's just a simple matter of political will to do it.
p243
aVAnd, of course, as I mentioned,
p244
aVthis cost has corresponding benefits.
p245
aVI mentioned there's a multiplier of about three,
p246
aV2.78, for the state economy,
p247
aVin terms of over 80 billion in extra earnings.
p248
aVAnd if we want to translate that from just billions of dollars
p249
aVto something that might mean something,
p250
aVwhat we're talking about is that, for the average low-income kid,
p251
aVthat would increase earnings by about 10 percent
p252
aVover their whole career, just doing the preschool,
p253
aVnot improving K-12 or anything else after that,
p254
aVnot doing anything with college tuition or access,
p255
aVjust directly improving preschool,
p256
aVand we would get five percent higher earnings
p257
aVfor middle-class kids.
p258
aVSo this is an investment
p259
aVthat pays off in very concrete terms
p260
aVfor a broad range of income groups in the state's population
p261
aVand produces large and tangible benefits.
p262
aa(lp263
VNow, that's one barrier.
p264
aVI actually think the more profound barrier
p265
aVis the long-term nature of the benefits from early childhood programs.
p266
aVSo the argument I'm making is, is that we're increasing
p267
aVthe quality of our local workforce,
p268
aVand thereby increasing economic development.
p269
aVObviously if we have a preschool with four-year-olds,
p270
aVwe're not sending these kids out at age five
p271
aVto work in the sweatshops, right? At least I hope not.
p272
aVSo we're talking about an investment
p273
aVthat in terms of impacts on the state economy
p274
aVis not going to really pay off for 15 or 20 years,
p275
aVand of course America is notorious for being
p276
aVa short term-oriented society.
p277
aVNow one response you can make to this,
p278
aVand I sometimes have done this in talks,
p279
aVis people can talk about, there are benefits for these programs
p280
aVin reducing special ed and remedial education costs,
p281
aVthere are benefits, parents care about preschool,
p282
aVmaybe we'll get some migration effects
p283
aVfrom parents seeking good preschool,
p284
aVand I think those are true,
p285
aVbut in some sense they're missing the point.
p286
aa(lp287
VUltimately, this is something
p288
aVwe're investing in now for the future.
p289
aVAnd so what I want to leave you with is
p290
aVwhat I think is the ultimate question.
p291
aVI mean, I'm an economist, but this is ultimately
p292
aVnot an economic question, it's a moral question:
p293
aVAre we willing, as Americans,
p294
aVare we as a society still capable
p295
aVof making the political choice to sacrifice now
p296
aVby paying more taxes
p297
aVin order to improve the long-term future
p298
aVof not only our kids, but our community?
p299
aVAre we still capable of that as a country?
p300
aVAnd that's something that each and every citizen
p301
aVand voter needs to ask themselves.
p302
aVIs that something that you are still invested in,
p303
aVthat you still believe in the notion of investment?
p304
aVThat is the notion of investment.
p305
aVYou sacrifice now for a return later.
p306
aa(lp307
VSo I think the research evidence
p308
aVon the benefits of early childhood programs
p309
aVfor the local economy is extremely strong.
p310
aVHowever, the moral and political choice
p311
aVis still up to us, as citizens and as voters.
p312
aa(lp313
VThank you very much. (Applause)

VIt was November 1, 2002,
p5
aVmy first day as a principal,
p6
aVbut hardly my first day in the school district of Philadelphia.
p7
aa(lp8
VI graduated from Philadelphia public schools,
p9
aVand I went on to teach special education for 20 years
p10
aVin a low-income, low-performing school
p11
aVin North Philadelphia,
p12
aVwhere crime is rampant
p13
aVand deep poverty is among the highest in the nation.
p14
aa(lp15
VShortly after I walked into my new school,
p16
aVa huge fight broke out among the girls.
p17
aVAfter things were quickly under control,
p18
aVI immediately called a meeting
p19
aVin the school's auditorium
p20
aVto introduce myself as the school's new principal.
p21
aV(Applause)
p22
aa(lp23
VI walked in angry,
p24
aVa little nervous \u2014
p25
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p26
aVbut I was determined
p27
aVto set the tone for my new students.
p28
aVI started listing as forcefully as I could
p29
aVmy expectations for their behavior
p30
aVand my expectations for what they would learn in school.
p31
aVWhen, all of a sudden,
p32
aVa girl way in the back of the auditorium,
p33
aVshe stood up
p34
aVand she said, "Miss!
p35
aVMiss!"
p36
aVWhen our eyes locked, she said,
p37
aV"Why do you keep calling this a school?
p38
aVThis is not a school."
p39
aa(lp40
VIn one outburst,
p41
aVAshley had expressed what I felt
p42
aVand never quite was able to articulate
p43
aVabout my own experience when I attended a low-performing school
p44
aVin the same neighborhood, many, many, many years earlier.
p45
aVThat school was definitely not a school.
p46
aa(lp47
VFast forwarding a decade later to 2012,
p48
aVI was entering my third low-performing school as principal.
p49
aVI was to be Strawberry Mansion's fourth principal in four years.
p50
aVIt was labeled "low-performing and persistently dangerous"
p51
aVdue to its low test scores
p52
aVand high number of weapons,
p53
aVdrugs, assaults and arrests.
p54
aVShortly as I approached the door of my new school
p55
aVand attempted to enter,
p56
aVand found the door locked with chains,
p57
aVI could hear Ashley's voice in my ears
p58
aVgoing, "Miss! Miss!
p59
aVThis is not a school."
p60
aVThe halls were dim and dark from poor lighting.
p61
aVThere were tons of piles of broken old furniture
p62
aVand desks in the classrooms,
p63
aVand there were thousands of unused materials and resources.
p64
aVThis was not a school.
p65
aVAs the year progressed,
p66
aVI noticed that the classrooms were nearly empty.
p67
aVThe students were just scared:
p68
aVscared to sit in rows in fear that something would happen;
p69
aVscared because they were often teased in the cafeteria for eating free food.
p70
aVThey were scared from all the fighting and all the bullying.
p71
aVThis was not a school.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd then, there were the teachers,
p74
aVwho were incredibly afraid for their own safety,
p75
aVso they had low expectations for the students and themselves,
p76
aVand they were totally unaware of their role
p77
aVin the destruction of the school's culture.
p78
aVThis was the most troubling of all.
p79
aVYou see, Ashley was right,
p80
aVand not just about her school.
p81
aVFor far too many schools,
p82
aVfor kids who live in poverty,
p83
aVtheir schools are really not schools at all.
p84
aVBut this can change.
p85
aVLet me tell you how it's being done at Strawberry Mansion High School.
p86
aVAnybody who's ever worked with me will tell you
p87
aVI am known for my slogans.
p88
aV(Laughter)
p89
aVSo today, I am going to use three
p90
aVthat have been paramount in our quest for change.
p91
aa(lp92
VMy first slogan is:
p93
aVif you're going to lead, lead.
p94
aVI always believed
p95
aVthat what happens in a school and what does not happen in a school
p96
aVis up to the principal.
p97
aVI am the principal,
p98
aVand having that title required me to lead.
p99
aVI was not going to stay in my office,
p100
aVI was not going to delegate my work,
p101
aVand I was not going to be afraid to address anything
p102
aVthat was not good for children,
p103
aVwhether that made me liked or not.
p104
aVI am a leader,
p105
aVso I know I cannot do anything alone.
p106
aVSo, I assembled a top-notch leadership team
p107
aVwho believed in the possibility of all the children,
p108
aVand together, we tackled the small things,
p109
aVlike resetting every single locker combination by hand
p110
aVso that every student could have a secure locker.
p111
aVWe decorated every bulletin board in that building
p112
aVwith bright, colorful, and positive messages.
p113
aVWe took the chains off the front doors of the school.
p114
aVWe got the lightbulbs replaced,
p115
aVand we cleaned every classroom to its core,
p116
aVrecycling every, every textbook that was not needed,
p117
aVand discarded thousands of old materials and furniture.
p118
aVWe used two dumpsters per day.
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd, of course, of course,
p121
aVwe tackled the big stuff,
p122
aVlike rehauling the entire school budget
p123
aVso that we can reallocate funds to have more teachers and support staff.
p124
aVWe rebuilt the entire school day schedule from scratch
p125
aVto add a variety of start and end times,
p126
aVremediation, honors courses,
p127
aVextracurricular activities, and counseling,
p128
aVall during the school day.
p129
aVAll during the school day.
p130
aVWe created a deployment plan
p131
aVthat specified where every single support person and police officer would be
p132
aVevery minute of the day,
p133
aVand we monitored at every second of the day,
p134
aVand, our best invention ever,
p135
aVwe devised a schoolwide discipline program
p136
aVtitled "Non-negotiables."
p137
aVIt was a behavior system \u2014
p138
aVdesigned to promote positive behavior at all times.
p139
aa(lp140
VThe results?
p141
aVStrawberry Mansion was removed from the Persistently Dangerous List
p142
aVour first year after being \u2014
p143
aV(Applause) \u2014
p144
aVafter being on the Persistently Dangerous List for five consecutive years.
p145
aVLeaders make the impossible possible.
p146
aa(lp147
VThat brings me to my second slogan:
p148
aVSo what? Now what?
p149
aV(Laughter)
p150
aV(Applause)
p151
aa(lp152
VWhen we looked at the data,
p153
aVand we met with the staff,
p154
aVthere were many excuses
p155
aVfor why Strawberry Mansion was low-performing and persistently dangerous.
p156
aVThey said that only 68 percent of the kids come to school on a regular basis,
p157
aV100 percent of them live in poverty,
p158
aVonly one percent of the parents participate,
p159
aVmany of the children
p160
aVcome from incarceration and single-parent homes,
p161
aV39 percent of the students have special needs,
p162
aVand the state data revealed
p163
aVthat six percent of the students were proficient in algebra,
p164
aVand 10 were proficient in literature.
p165
aa(lp166
VAfter they got through telling us all the stories
p167
aVof how awful the conditions and the children were,
p168
aVI looked at them,
p169
aVand I said, "So what. Now what?
p170
aVWhat are we gonna do about it?"
p171
aV(Applause)
p172
aa(lp173
VEliminating excuses at every turn became my primary responsibility.
p174
aVWe addressed every one of those excuses
p175
aVthrough a mandatory professional development,
p176
aVpaving the way for intense focus on teaching and learning.
p177
aVAfter many observations,
p178
aVwhat we determined was that teachers knew what to teach
p179
aVbut they did not know how to teach
p180
aVso many children with so many vast abilities.
p181
aVSo, we developed a lesson delivery model for instruction
p182
aVthat focused on small group instruction,
p183
aVmaking it possible for all the students to get their individual needs met
p184
aVin the classroom.
p185
aa(lp186
VThe results?
p187
aVAfter one year, state data revealed
p188
aVthat our scores have grown by 171 percent in Algebra
p189
aVand 107 percent in literature.
p190
aV(Applause)
p191
aVWe have a very long way to go,
p192
aVa very long way to go,
p193
aVbut we now approach every obstacle with a "So What. Now What?" attitude.
p194
aa(lp195
VAnd that brings me to my third and final slogan.
p196
aV(Laughter)
p197
aVIf nobody told you they loved you today,
p198
aVyou remember I do, and I always will.
p199
aa(lp200
VMy students have problems:
p201
aVsocial, emotional and economic problems
p202
aVyou could never imagine.
p203
aVSome of them are parents themselves,
p204
aVand some are completely alone.
p205
aVIf someone asked me my real secret
p206
aVfor how I truly keep Strawberry Mansion moving forward,
p207
aVI would have to say that I love my students
p208
aVand I believe in their possibilities
p209
aVunconditionally.
p210
aVWhen I look at them,
p211
aVI can only see what they can become,
p212
aVand that is because I am one of them.
p213
aVI grew up poor in North Philadelphia too.
p214
aVI know what it feels like to go to a school that's not a school.
p215
aVI know what it feels like to wonder
p216
aVif there's ever going to be any way out of poverty.
p217
aVBut because of my amazing mother,
p218
aVI got the ability to dream
p219
aVdespite the poverty that surrounded me.
p220
aa(lp221
VSo \u2014
p222
aV(Applause) \u2014
p223
aVif I'm going to push my students
p224
aVtoward their dream and their purpose in life,
p225
aVI've got to get to know who they are.
p226
aVSo I have to spend time with them,
p227
aVso I manage the lunchroom every day.
p228
aV(Laughter)
p229
aVAnd while I'm there,
p230
aVI talk to them about deeply personal things,
p231
aVand when it's their birthday,
p232
aVI sing "Happy Birthday"
p233
aVeven though I cannot sing at all.
p234
aV(Laughter)
p235
aVI often ask them,
p236
aV"Why do you want me to sing when I cannot sing at all?"
p237
aV(Laughter)
p238
aVAnd they respond by saying,
p239
aV"Because we like feeling special."
p240
aa(lp241
VWe hold monthly town hall meetings
p242
aVto listen to their concerns,
p243
aVto find out what is on their minds.
p244
aVThey ask us questions like, "Why do we have to follow rules?"
p245
aV"Why are there so many consequences?"
p246
aV"Why can't we just do what we want to do?"
p247
aV(Laughter)
p248
aVThey ask, and I answer each question honestly,
p249
aVand this exchange in listening helps to clear up any misconceptions.
p250
aVEvery moment is a teachable moment.
p251
aa(lp252
VMy reward,
p253
aVmy reward
p254
aVfor being non-negotiable in my rules and consequences
p255
aVis their earned respect.
p256
aVI insist on it,
p257
aVand because of this, we can accomplish things together.
p258
aVThey are clear about my expectations for them,
p259
aVand I repeat those expectations every day over the P.A. system.
p260
aVI remind them \u2014
p261
aV(Laughter)
p262
aVI remind them of those core values
p263
aVof focus, tradition, excellence,
p264
aVintegrity and perseverance,
p265
aVand I remind them every day
p266
aVhow education can truly change their lives.
p267
aVAnd I end every announcement the same:
p268
aV"If nobody told you they loved you today,
p269
aVyou remember I do,
p270
aVand I always will."
p271
aa(lp272
VAshley's words
p273
aVof "Miss, Miss,
p274
aVthis is not a school,"
p275
aVis forever etched in my mind.
p276
aVIf we are truly going to make real progress
p277
aVin addressing poverty,
p278
aVthen we have to make sure
p279
aVthat every school that serves children in poverty
p280
aVis a real school,
p281
aVa school, a school \u2014
p282
aV(Applause) \u2014
p283
aVa school that provides them with knowledge
p284
aVand mental training to navigate the world around them.
p285
aa(lp286
VI do not know all the answers,
p287
aVbut what I do know is for those of us who are privileged
p288
aVand have the responsibility of leading a school that serves children in poverty,
p289
aVwe must truly lead,
p290
aVand when we are faced with unbelievable challenges,
p291
aVwe must stop and ask ourselves, "So what. Now what?
p292
aVWhat are we going to do about it?"
p293
aVAnd as we lead,
p294
aVwe must never forget
p295
aVthat every single one of our students
p296
aVis just a child,
p297
aVoften scared by what the world tells them they should be,
p298
aVand no matter what the rest of the world tells them they should be,
p299
aVwe should always provide them with hope,
p300
aVour undivided attention,
p301
aVunwavering belief in their potential,
p302
aVconsistent expectations,
p303
aVand we must tell them often,
p304
aVif nobody told them they loved them today,
p305
aVremember we do, and we always will.
p306
aa(lp307
VThank you.
p308
aa(lp309
V(Applause)
p310
aa(lp311
VThank you, Jesus.

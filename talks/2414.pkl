VI'm a marine biologist and an explorer-photographer
p5
aVwith National Geographic,
p6
aVbut I want to share a secret.
p7
aVThis image is totally incorrect,
p8
aVtotally incorrect.
p9
aVI see a couple of people crying in the back
p10
aVthat I've blown their idea of mermaids.
p11
aVAll right, the mermaid is indeed real,
p12
aVbut anyone who's gone on a dive
p13
aVwill know that the ocean looks more like this.
p14
aVIt's because the ocean is this massive filter,
p15
aVand as soon as you start going underwater,
p16
aVyou're going to lose your colors,
p17
aVand it's going to get dark and blue very quickly.
p18
aa(lp19
VBut we're humans \u2014 we're terrestrial mammals.
p20
aVAnd we've got trichromatic vision,
p21
aVso we see in red, green and blue,
p22
aVand we're just complete color addicts.
p23
aVWe love eye-popping color,
p24
aVand we try to bring this eye-popping color
p25
aVunderwater with us.
p26
aa(lp27
VSo there's been a long and sordid history of bringing color underwater,
p28
aVand it starts 88 years ago with Bill Longley and Charles Martin,
p29
aVwho were trying to take the first underwater color photograph.
p30
aVAnd they're in there with old-school scuba suits,
p31
aVwhere you're pumping air down to them,
p32
aVand they've got a pontoon of high-explosive magnesium powder,
p33
aVand the poor people at the surface are not sure
p34
aVwhen they're going to pull the string when they've got their frame in focus,
p35
aVand \u2014 boom! \u2014 a pound of high explosives would go off
p36
aVso they could put a little bit of light underwater
p37
aVand get an image like this beautiful hogfish.
p38
aVI mean, it's a gorgeous image, but this is not real.
p39
aVThey're creating an artificial environment
p40
aVso we can satisfy our own addiction to color.
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd looking at it the other way, what we've been finding
p43
aVis that instead of bringing color underwater with us,
p44
aVthat we've been looking at the blue ocean,
p45
aVand it's a crucible of blue,
p46
aVand these animals living there for millions of years
p47
aVhave been evolving all sorts of ways to take in that blue light
p48
aVand give off other colors.
p49
aVAnd here's just a little sample of what this secret world looks like.
p50
aVIt's like an underwater light show.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Music)
p53
aa(lp54
VAgain, what we're seeing here is blue light hitting this image.
p55
aVThese animals are absorbing the blue light
p56
aVand immediately transforming this light.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo if you think about it, the ocean is 71 percent of the planet,
p59
aVand blue light can extend down to almost a 1,000 meters.
p60
aVAs we go down underwater,
p61
aVafter about 10 meters, all the red is gone.
p62
aVSo if you see anything under 10 meters that's red,
p63
aVit's an animal transforming and creating its own red.
p64
aVThis is the largest single monochromatic blue environment on our planet.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd my gateway into this world of biofluorescence begins with corals.
p67
aVAnd I want to give a full TED Talk on corals
p68
aVand just how cool these things are.
p69
aVOne of the things that they do, one of their miraculous feats,
p70
aVis they produce lots of these fluorescent proteins,
p71
aVfluorescent molecules.
p72
aVAnd in this coral, it could be making up to 14 percent of its body mass \u2014
p73
aVcould be this fluorescent protein.
p74
aVSo you wouldn't be making, like, 14 percent muscle and not using it,
p75
aVso it's likely doing something that has a functional role.
p76
aVAnd for the last 10, 15 years, this was so special to me,
p77
aVbecause this molecule has turned out to be one of the most revolutionary tools
p78
aVin biomedical science,
p79
aVand it's allowing us to better see inside ourselves.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo, how do I study this?
p82
aVIn order to study biofluorescence, we swim at night.
p83
aVAnd when I started out,
p84
aVI was just using these blue duct-tape filters over my strobe,
p85
aVso I could make sure I'm actually seeing the light
p86
aVthat's being transformed by the animals.
p87
aVWe're making an exhibit for the Museum of Natural History,
p88
aVand we're trying to show off how great the fluorescent corals are on the reef,
p89
aVand something happened that just blew me away:
p90
aVthis.
p91
aVIn the middle of our corals,
p92
aVis this green fluorescent fish.
p93
aVIt's the first time we've ever seen a green fluorescent fish
p94
aVor any vertebrate for that matter.
p95
aVAnd we're rubbing our eyes, checking the filters,
p96
aVthinking that somebody's maybe playing a joke on us with the camera,
p97
aVbut the eel was real.
p98
aa(lp99
VIt was the first green fluorescent eel that we found,
p100
aVand this just changed my trajectory completely.
p101
aVSo I had to put down my corals and team up
p102
aVwith a fish scientist, John Sparks,
p103
aVand begin a search around the world
p104
aVto see how prevalent this phenomenon is.
p105
aVAnd fish are much more interesting than corals,
p106
aVbecause they have really advanced vision,
p107
aVand some of the fish even have, the way that I was photographing it,
p108
aVthey have lenses in their eyes that would magnify the fluorescence.
p109
aVSo I wanted to seek this out further.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo we designed a new set of gear
p112
aVand we're scouring the reefs around the world,
p113
aVlooking for fluorescent life.
p114
aVAnd it's a bit like "E.T. phone home."
p115
aVWe're out there swimming with this blue light,
p116
aVand we're looking for a response,
p117
aVfor animals to be absorbing the light and transferring this back to us.
p118
aVAnd eventually, we found our photobombing Kaupichphys eel.
p119
aVIt's a really shy, reclusive eel that we know almost nothing about.
p120
aVThey're only about the size of my finger,
p121
aVand they spend about 99.9 percent of their time hidden under a rock.
p122
aVBut these eels do come out to mate under full-moon nights,
p123
aVand that full-moon night translates underwater to blue.
p124
aVPerhaps they're using this as a way to see each other,
p125
aVquickly find each other, mate,
p126
aVgo back into their hole for the next long stint of time.
p127
aVBut then we started to find other fluorescent marine life,
p128
aVlike this green fluorescent bream,
p129
aVwith its, like, racing stripes along its head and its nape,
p130
aVand it's almost camouflaged and fluorescing at the same intensity
p131
aVas the fluorescent coral there.
p132
aa(lp133
VAfter this fish,
p134
aVwe were introduced to this red fluorescent scorpionfish
p135
aVcloaked and hidden on this rock.
p136
aVThe only time we've ever seen this, it's either on red fluorescent algae
p137
aVor red fluorescent coral.
p138
aa(lp139
VLater, we found this stealthy green fluorescent lizardfish.
p140
aVThese lizardfish come in many varieties,
p141
aVand they look almost exactly alike under white light.
p142
aVBut if you look at them under fluorescent light,
p143
aVyou see lots of patterns,
p144
aVyou can really see the differences among them.
p145
aVAnd in total \u2014 we just reported this last year \u2014
p146
aVwe found over 200 species of biofluorescent fish.
p147
aa(lp148
VOne of my inspirations is French artist and biologist Jean Painlevé.
p149
aVHe really captures this entrepreneuring, creative spirit in biology.
p150
aVHe would design his own gear, make his own cameras,
p151
aVand he was fascinated with the seahorse, Hippocampus erectus,
p152
aVand he filmed for the first time the seahorse giving birth.
p153
aVSo this is the male seahorse.
p154
aVThey were one of the first fish to start swimming upright
p155
aVwith their brain above their head.
p156
aVThe males give birth,
p157
aVjust phenomenal creatures.
p158
aVSo he stayed awake for days.
p159
aVHe even put this electrical visor on his head that would shock him,
p160
aVso he could capture this moment.
p161
aVNow, I wish I could have shown Painlevé
p162
aVthe moment where we found biofluorescent seahorses
p163
aVin the exact same species that he was studying.
p164
aVAnd here's our footage.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Music)
p167
aa(lp168
VThey're the most cryptic fish.
p169
aVYou could be swimming right on top of them and not see the seahorse.
p170
aVThey would blend right into the algae, which would also fluoresce red,
p171
aVbut they've got great vision,
p172
aVand they go through this long mating ritual,
p173
aVand perhaps they're using it in that effect.
p174
aa(lp175
VBut things got pretty edgy
p176
aVwhen we found green fluorescence in the stingray,
p177
aVbecause stingrays are in the Elasmobranch class,
p178
aVwhich includes ...
p179
aVsharks.
p180
aVSo I'm, like, a coral biologist.
p181
aVSomebody's got to go down and check to see if the sharks are fluorescent.
p182
aVAnd there I am.
p183
aa(lp184
V(Laughter)
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd I was like, "Maybe I should go back to corals."
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
VIt turns out that these sharks are not fluorescent.
p191
aVAnd then we found it.
p192
aVIn a deep, dark canyon off the coast of California,
p193
aVwe found the first biofluorescent swellshark,
p194
aVright underneath all the surfers.
p195
aVHere it is.
p196
aVThey're just about a meter long. It's called a swellshark.
p197
aVAnd they call them a swellshark because if they're threatened,
p198
aVthey can gulp down water and blow up like an inner tube,
p199
aVabout twice their size,
p200
aVand wedge themselves under a rock, so they don't get eaten by a predator.
p201
aVAnd here is our first footage of these biofluorescent swellsharks.
p202
aVJust magnificent \u2014 I mean, they're showing these distinct patterns,
p203
aVand there are areas that are fluorescent and areas that are not fluorescent,
p204
aVbut they've also got these twinkling spots on them
p205
aVthat are much brighter than other parts of the shark.
p206
aa(lp207
VBut this is all beautiful to see.
p208
aVI was like, this is gorgeous.
p209
aVBut what does it mean to the shark?
p210
aVCan they see this?
p211
aVAnd we looked in the literature,
p212
aVand nothing was known about this shark's vision.
p213
aVSo I took this shark to eye specialist Ellis Loew at Cornell University,
p214
aVand we found out that this shark sees discretely and acutely
p215
aVin the blue-green interface,
p216
aVprobably about 100 times better than we can see in the dark,
p217
aVbut they only see blue-green.
p218
aVSo what it's doing is taking this blue world
p219
aVand it's absorbing the blue, creating green.
p220
aVIt's creating contrast that they can indeed see.
p221
aVSo we have a model,
p222
aVshowing that it creates an ability for them to see all these patterns.
p223
aVAnd males and females also have, we're finding,
p224
aVdistinct patterns among them.
p225
aa(lp226
VBut our last find came really just a few miles from where we are now,
p227
aVin the Solomon Islands.
p228
aVSwimming at night, I encountered the first biofluorescent sea turtle.
p229
aVSo now it's going from fish and sharks into reptiles,
p230
aVwhich, again, this is only one month old,
p231
aVbut it shows us that we know almost nothing
p232
aVabout this hawksbill turtle's vision.
p233
aVAnd it makes me think about how much more there is to learn.
p234
aVAnd here in the Solomon Islands,
p235
aVthere's only a few thousand breeding females of this species left,
p236
aVand this is one of the hotspots for them.
p237
aVSo it shows us how much we need to really protect these animals
p238
aVwhile they're still here, and understand them.
p239
aa(lp240
VIn thinking about biofluorescence,
p241
aVI wanted to know, how deep does it go?
p242
aVDoes this go all the way to the bottom of the ocean?
p243
aVSo we started using submarines, and we equipped them
p244
aVwith special blue lights on the front here.
p245
aVAnd we dropped down,
p246
aVand we noticed one important thing \u2014
p247
aVthat as we get down to 1,000 meters,
p248
aVit drops off.
p249
aVThere's no biofluorescent marine life down there, below 1,000 meters \u2014
p250
aValmost nothing, it's just darkness.
p251
aVSo it's mainly a shallow phenomenon.
p252
aVAnd below 1,000 meters,
p253
aVwe encountered the bioluminescent zone,
p254
aVwhere nine out of 10 animals are actually making their own lights
p255
aVand flashing and blinking.
p256
aa(lp257
VAs I try to get deeper,
p258
aVthis is slapping on a one-person submarine suit \u2014
p259
aVsome people call this my "Jacques Cousteau meets Woody Allen" moment.
p260
aa(lp261
V(Laughter)
p262
aa(lp263
VBut as we explore down here,
p264
aVI was thinking about: How do we interact with life delicately?
p265
aVBecause we're entering a new age of exploration,
p266
aVwhere we have to take great care,
p267
aVand we have to set examples how we explore.
p268
aVSo I've teamed up with roboticist Rob Wood at Harvard University,
p269
aVand we've been designing squishy underwater robot fingers,
p270
aVso we can delicately interact with the marine life down there.
p271
aVThe idea is that most of our technologies to explore the deep ocean
p272
aVcome from oil and gas and military,
p273
aVwho, you know, they're not really caring to be gentle.
p274
aVSome corals could be 1,000 years old.
p275
aVYou don't want to just go and crush them with a big claw.
p276
aVSo my dream is something like this.
p277
aVAt night, I'm in a submarine,
p278
aVI have force-feedback gloves,
p279
aVand I could delicately set up a lab in the front of my submarine,
p280
aVwhere the squishy robot fingers
p281
aVare delicately collecting and putting things in jars,
p282
aVand we can conduct our research.
p283
aa(lp284
VBack to the powerful applied applications.
p285
aVHere, you're looking at a living brain
p286
aVthat's using the DNA of fluorescent marine creatures,
p287
aVthis one from jellyfish and corals,
p288
aVto illuminate the living brain and see its connections.
p289
aVIt's funny that we're using RGB
p290
aVjust to kind of satisfy our own human intuition,
p291
aVso we can see our brains better.
p292
aVAnd even more mind-blowing,
p293
aVis my close colleague Vincent Pieribone at Yale,
p294
aVwho has actually designed and engineered a fluorescent protein
p295
aVthat responds to voltage.
p296
aVSo he could see when a single neuron fires.
p297
aVYou're essentially looking at a portal into consciousness
p298
aVthat was designed by marine creatures.
p299
aa(lp300
VSo this brings me all back to perspective and relationship.
p301
aVFrom deep space,
p302
aVour universe looks like a human brain cell,
p303
aVand then here we are in the deep ocean,
p304
aVand we're finding marine creatures and cells
p305
aVthat can illuminate the human mind.
p306
aVAnd it's my hope that with illuminated minds,
p307
aVwe could ponder the overarching interconnectedness of all life,
p308
aVand fathom how much more lies in store
p309
aVif we keep our oceans healthy.
p310
aa(lp311
VThank you.

VA few months ago,
p5
aVa 40 year-old woman came to an emergency room
p6
aVin a hospital close to where I live,
p7
aVand she was brought in confused.
p8
aVHer blood pressure was an alarming
p9
aV230 over 170.
p10
aVWithin a few minutes, she went into cardiac collapse.
p11
aVShe was resuscitated, stabilized,
p12
aVwhisked over to a CAT scan suite
p13
aVright next to the emergency room,
p14
aVbecause they were concerned about blood clots in the lung.
p15
aVAnd the CAT scan revealed
p16
aVno blood clots in the lung,
p17
aVbut it showed bilateral, visible, palpable breast masses,
p18
aVbreast tumors,
p19
aVthat had metastasized widely
p20
aVall over the body.
p21
aVAnd the real tragedy was, if you look through her records,
p22
aVshe had been seen
p23
aVin four or five other health care institutions
p24
aVin the preceding two years.
p25
aVFour or five opportunities
p26
aVto see the breast masses, touch the breast mass,
p27
aVintervene at a much earlier stage
p28
aVthan when we saw her.
p29
aa(lp30
VLadies and gentlemen,
p31
aVthat is not an unusual story.
p32
aVUnfortunately, it happens all the time.
p33
aVI joke, but I only half joke,
p34
aVthat if you come to one of our hospitals missing a limb,
p35
aVno one will believe you till they get a CAT scan, MRI
p36
aVor orthopedic consult.
p37
aVI am not a Luddite.
p38
aVI teach at Stanford.
p39
aVI'm a physician practicing with cutting-edge technology.
p40
aVBut I'd like to make the case to you
p41
aVin the next 17 minutes
p42
aVthat when we shortcut the physical exam,
p43
aVwhen we lean towards ordering tests
p44
aVinstead of talking to and examining the patient,
p45
aVwe not only overlook simple diagnoses
p46
aVthat can be diagnosed at a treatable, early stage,
p47
aVbut we're losing much more than that.
p48
aVWe're losing a ritual.
p49
aVWe're losing a ritual that I believe is transformative, transcendent,
p50
aVand is at the heart
p51
aVof the patient-physician relationship.
p52
aVThis may actually be heresy to say this at TED,
p53
aVbut I'd like to introduce you
p54
aVto the most important innovation,
p55
aVI think, in medicine
p56
aVto come in the next 10 years,
p57
aVand that is the power of the human hand \u2014
p58
aVto touch, to comfort, to diagnose
p59
aVand to bring about treatment.
p60
aa(lp61
VI'd like to introduce you first to this person
p62
aVwhose image you may or may not recognize.
p63
aVThis is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
p64
aVSince we're in Edinburgh, I'm a big fan of Conan Doyle.
p65
aVYou might not know that Conan Doyle went to medical school
p66
aVhere in Edinburgh,
p67
aVand his character, Sherlock Holmes,
p68
aVwas inspired by Sir Joseph Bell.
p69
aVJoseph Bell was an extraordinary teacher by all accounts.
p70
aVAnd Conan Doyle, writing about Bell,
p71
aVdescribed the following exchange
p72
aVbetween Bell and his students.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo picture Bell sitting in the outpatient department,
p75
aVstudents all around him,
p76
aVpatients signing up in the emergency room
p77
aVand being registered and being brought in.
p78
aVAnd a woman comes in with a child,
p79
aVand Conan Doyle describes the following exchange.
p80
aVThe woman says, "Good Morning."
p81
aVBell says, "What sort of crossing did you have
p82
aVon the ferry from Burntisland?"
p83
aVShe says, "It was good."
p84
aVAnd he says, "What did you do with the other child?"
p85
aVShe says, "I left him with my sister at Leith."
p86
aVAnd he says,
p87
aV"And did you take the shortcut down Inverleith Row
p88
aVto get here to the infirmary?"
p89
aVShe says, "I did."
p90
aVAnd he says, "Would you still be working at the linoleum factory?"
p91
aVAnd she says, "I am."
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd Bell then goes on to explain to the students.
p94
aVHe says, "You see, when she said, 'Good morning,'
p95
aVI picked up her Fife accent.
p96
aVAnd the nearest ferry crossing from Fife is from Burntisland.
p97
aVAnd so she must have taken the ferry over.
p98
aVYou notice that the coat she's carrying
p99
aVis too small for the child who is with her,
p100
aVand therefore, she started out the journey with two children,
p101
aVbut dropped one off along the way.
p102
aVYou notice the clay on the soles of her feet.
p103
aVSuch red clay is not found within a hundred miles of Edinburgh,
p104
aVexcept in the botanical gardens.
p105
aVAnd therefore, she took a short cut down Inverleith Row
p106
aVto arrive here.
p107
aVAnd finally, she has a dermatitis
p108
aVon the fingers of her right hand,
p109
aVa dermatitis that is unique
p110
aVto the linoleum factory workers in Burntisland."
p111
aVAnd when Bell actually strips the patient,
p112
aVbegins to examine the patient,
p113
aVyou can only imagine how much more he would discern.
p114
aVAnd as a teacher of medicine, as a student myself,
p115
aVI was so inspired by that story.
p116
aa(lp117
VBut you might not realize
p118
aVthat our ability to look into the body
p119
aVin this simple way, using our senses,
p120
aVis quite recent.
p121
aVThe picture I'm showing you is of Leopold Auenbrugger
p122
aVwho, in the late 1700s,
p123
aVdiscovered percussion.
p124
aVAnd the story is that Leopold Auenbrugger
p125
aVwas the son of an innkeeper.
p126
aVAnd his father used to go down into the basement
p127
aVto tap on the sides of casks of wine
p128
aVto determine how much wine was left
p129
aVand whether to reorder.
p130
aVAnd so when Auenbrugger became a physician,
p131
aVhe began to do the same thing.
p132
aVHe began to tap on the chests of his patients,
p133
aVon their abdomens.
p134
aVAnd basically everything we know about percussion,
p135
aVwhich you can think of as an ultrasound of its day \u2014
p136
aVorgan enlargement, fluid around the heart, fluid in the lungs,
p137
aVabdominal changes \u2014
p138
aVall of this he described in this wonderful manuscript
p139
aV"Inventum Novum," "New Invention,"
p140
aVwhich would have disappeared into obscurity,
p141
aVexcept for the fact that this physician, Corvisart,
p142
aVa famous French physician \u2014
p143
aVfamous only because he was physician to this gentleman \u2014
p144
aVCorvisart repopularized and reintroduced the work.
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd it was followed a year or two later
p147
aVby Laennec discovering the stethoscope.
p148
aVLaennec, it is said, was walking in the streets of Paris
p149
aVand saw two children playing with a stick.
p150
aVOne was scratching at the end of the stick,
p151
aVanother child listened at the other end.
p152
aVAnd Laennec thought this would be a wonderful way
p153
aVto listen to the chest or listen to the abdomen
p154
aVusing what he called "the cylinder."
p155
aVLater he renamed it the stethoscope.
p156
aVAnd that is how stethoscope and auscultation was born.
p157
aVSo within a few years,
p158
aVin the late 1800s, early 1900s,
p159
aVall of a sudden,
p160
aVthe barber surgeon had given way
p161
aVto the physician who was trying to make a diagnosis.
p162
aa(lp163
VIf you'll recall, prior to that time,
p164
aVno matter what ailed you, you went to see the barber surgeon
p165
aVwho wound up cupping you,
p166
aVbleeding you, purging you.
p167
aVAnd, oh yes, if you wanted,
p168
aVhe would give you a haircut \u2014 short on the sides, long in the back \u2014
p169
aVand pull your tooth while he was at it.
p170
aVHe made no attempt at diagnosis.
p171
aVIn fact, some of you might well know
p172
aVthat the barber pole, the red and white stripes,
p173
aVrepresents the blood bandages of the barber surgeon,
p174
aVand the receptacles on either end
p175
aVrepresent the pots in which the blood was collected.
p176
aVBut the arrival of auscultation and percussion
p177
aVrepresented a sea change,
p178
aVa moment when physicians were beginning to look inside the body.
p179
aa(lp180
VAnd this particular painting, I think,
p181
aVrepresents the pinnacle, the peak, of that clinical era.
p182
aVThis is a very famous painting:
p183
aV"The Doctor" by Luke Fildes.
p184
aVLuke Fildes was commissioned to paint this by Tate,
p185
aVwho then established the Tate Gallery.
p186
aVAnd Tate asked Fildes to paint a painting
p187
aVof social importance.
p188
aVAnd it's interesting that Fildes picked this topic.
p189
aVFildes' oldest son, Philip,
p190
aVdied at the age of nine on Christmas Eve
p191
aVafter a brief illness.
p192
aVAnd Fildes was so taken by the physician
p193
aVwho held vigil at the bedside for two, three nights,
p194
aVthat he decided that he would try and depict
p195
aVthe physician in our time \u2014
p196
aValmost a tribute to this physician.
p197
aVAnd hence the painting "The Doctor," a very famous painting.
p198
aVIt's been on calendars, postage stamps in many different countries.
p199
aVI've often wondered, what would Fildes have done
p200
aVhad he been asked to paint this painting
p201
aVin the modern era,
p202
aVin the year 2011?
p203
aVWould he have substituted a computer screen
p204
aVfor where he had the patient?
p205
aa(lp206
VI've gotten into some trouble in Silicon Valley
p207
aVfor saying that the patient in the bed
p208
aVhas almost become an icon
p209
aVfor the real patient who's in the computer.
p210
aVI've actually coined a term for that entity in the computer.
p211
aVI call it the iPatient.
p212
aVThe iPatient is getting wonderful care all across America.
p213
aVThe real patient often wonders,
p214
aVwhere is everyone?
p215
aVWhen are they going to come by and explain things to me?
p216
aVWho's in charge?
p217
aVThere's a real disjunction between the patient's perception
p218
aVand our own perceptions as physicians of the best medical care.
p219
aa(lp220
VI want to show you a picture
p221
aVof what rounds looked like
p222
aVwhen I was in training.
p223
aVThe focus was around the patient.
p224
aVWe went from bed to bed. The attending physician was in charge.
p225
aVToo often these days,
p226
aVrounds look very much like this,
p227
aVwhere the discussion is taking place
p228
aVin a room far away from the patient.
p229
aVThe discussion is all about images on the computer, data.
p230
aVAnd the one critical piece missing
p231
aVis that of the patient.
p232
aa(lp233
VNow I've been influenced in this thinking
p234
aVby two anecdotes that I want to share with you.
p235
aVOne had to do with a friend of mine who had a breast cancer,
p236
aVhad a small breast cancer detected \u2014
p237
aVhad her lumpectomy in the town in which I lived.
p238
aVThis is when I was in Texas.
p239
aVAnd she then spent a lot of time researching
p240
aVto find the best cancer center in the world
p241
aVto get her subsequent care.
p242
aVAnd she found the place and decided to go there, went there.
p243
aVWhich is why I was surprised a few months later
p244
aVto see her back in our own town,
p245
aVgetting her subsequent care with her private oncologist.
p246
aa(lp247
VAnd I pressed her, and I asked her,
p248
aV"Why did you come back and get your care here?"
p249
aVAnd she was reluctant to tell me.
p250
aVShe said, "The cancer center was wonderful.
p251
aVIt had a beautiful facility,
p252
aVgiant atrium, valet parking,
p253
aVa piano that played itself,
p254
aVa concierge that took you around from here to there.
p255
aVBut," she said,
p256
aV"but they did not touch my breasts."
p257
aVNow you and I could argue
p258
aVthat they probably did not need to touch her breasts.
p259
aVThey had her scanned inside out.
p260
aVThey understood her breast cancer at the molecular level;
p261
aVthey had no need to touch her breasts.
p262
aa(lp263
VBut to her, it mattered deeply.
p264
aVIt was enough for her to make the decision
p265
aVto get her subsequent care with her private oncologist
p266
aVwho, every time she went,
p267
aVexamined both breasts including the axillary tail,
p268
aVexamined her axilla carefully,
p269
aVexamined her cervical region, her inguinal region,
p270
aVdid a thorough exam.
p271
aVAnd to her, that spoke of a kind of attentiveness that she needed.
p272
aVI was very influenced by that anecdote.
p273
aa(lp274
VI was also influenced by another experience that I had,
p275
aVagain, when I was in Texas, before I moved to Stanford.
p276
aVI had a reputation
p277
aVas being interested in patients
p278
aVwith chronic fatigue.
p279
aVThis is not a reputation you would wish on your worst enemy.
p280
aVI say that because these are difficult patients.
p281
aVThey have often been rejected by their families,
p282
aVhave had bad experiences with medical care
p283
aVand they come to you fully prepared
p284
aVfor you to join the long list of people
p285
aVwho's about to disappoint them.
p286
aVAnd I learned very early on with my first patient
p287
aVthat I could not do justice
p288
aVto this very complicated patient
p289
aVwith all the records they were bringing
p290
aVin a new patient visit of 45 minutes.
p291
aVThere was just no way.
p292
aVAnd if I tried, I'd disappoint them.
p293
aa(lp294
VAnd so I hit on this method
p295
aVwhere I invited the patient
p296
aVto tell me the story for their entire first visit,
p297
aVand I tried not to interrupt them.
p298
aVWe know the average American physician
p299
aVinterrupts their patient in 14 seconds.
p300
aVAnd if I ever get to heaven,
p301
aVit will be because I held my piece for 45 minutes
p302
aVand did not interrupt my patient.
p303
aVI then scheduled the physical exam for two weeks hence,
p304
aVand when the patient came for the physical,
p305
aVI was able to do a thorough physical,
p306
aVbecause I had nothing else to do.
p307
aVI like to think that I do a thorough physical exam,
p308
aVbut because the whole visit was now about the physical,
p309
aVI could do an extraordinarily thorough exam.
p310
aa(lp311
VAnd I remember my very first patient in that series
p312
aVcontinued to tell me more history
p313
aVduring what was meant to be the physical exam visit.
p314
aVAnd I began my ritual.
p315
aVI always begin with the pulse,
p316
aVthen I examine the hands, then I look at the nail beds,
p317
aVthen I slide my hand up to the epitrochlear node,
p318
aVand I was into my ritual.
p319
aVAnd when my ritual began,
p320
aVthis very voluble patient
p321
aVbegan to quiet down.
p322
aVAnd I remember having a very eerie sense
p323
aVthat the patient and I
p324
aVhad slipped back into a primitive ritual
p325
aVin which I had a role
p326
aVand the patient had a role.
p327
aVAnd when I was done,
p328
aVthe patient said to me with some awe,
p329
aV"I have never been examined like this before."
p330
aVNow if that were true,
p331
aVit's a true condemnation of our health care system,
p332
aVbecause they had been seen in other places.
p333
aa(lp334
VI then proceeded to tell the patient,
p335
aVonce the patient was dressed,
p336
aVthe standard things that the person must have heard in other institutions,
p337
aVwhich is, "This is not in your head.
p338
aVThis is real.
p339
aVThe good news, it's not cancer, it's not tuberculosis,
p340
aVit's not coccidioidomycosis or some obscure fungal infection.
p341
aVThe bad news is we don't know exactly what's causing this,
p342
aVbut here's what you should do, here's what we should do."
p343
aVAnd I would lay out all the standard treatment options
p344
aVthat the patient had heard elsewhere.
p345
aa(lp346
VAnd I always felt
p347
aVthat if my patient gave up the quest
p348
aVfor the magic doctor, the magic treatment
p349
aVand began with me on a course towards wellness,
p350
aVit was because I had earned the right
p351
aVto tell them these things
p352
aVby virtue of the examination.
p353
aVSomething of importance had transpired in the exchange.
p354
aVI took this to my colleagues
p355
aVat Stanford in anthropology
p356
aVand told them the same story.
p357
aVAnd they immediately said to me,
p358
aV"Well you are describing a classic ritual."
p359
aVAnd they helped me understand
p360
aVthat rituals are all about transformation.
p361
aa(lp362
VWe marry, for example,
p363
aVwith great pomp and ceremony and expense
p364
aVto signal our departure
p365
aVfrom a life of solitude and misery and loneliness
p366
aVto one of eternal bliss.
p367
aVI'm not sure why you're laughing.
p368
aVThat was the original intent, was it not?
p369
aVWe signal transitions of power
p370
aVwith rituals.
p371
aVWe signal the passage of a life with rituals.
p372
aVRituals are terribly important.
p373
aVThey're all about transformation.
p374
aVWell I would submit to you
p375
aVthat the ritual
p376
aVof one individual coming to another
p377
aVand telling them things
p378
aVthat they would not tell their preacher or rabbi,
p379
aVand then, incredibly on top of that,
p380
aVdisrobing and allowing touch \u2014
p381
aVI would submit to you that that is a ritual of exceeding importance.
p382
aVAnd if you shortchange that ritual
p383
aVby not undressing the patient,
p384
aVby listening with your stethoscope on top of the nightgown,
p385
aVby not doing a complete exam,
p386
aVyou have bypassed on the opportunity
p387
aVto seal the patient-physician relationship.
p388
aa(lp389
VI am a writer,
p390
aVand I want to close by reading you a short passage that I wrote
p391
aVthat has to do very much with this scene.
p392
aVI'm an infectious disease physician,
p393
aVand in the early days of HIV, before we had our medications,
p394
aVI presided over so many scenes like this.
p395
aVI remember, every time I went to a patient's deathbed,
p396
aVwhether in the hospital or at home,
p397
aVI remember my sense of failure \u2014
p398
aVthe feeling of I don't know what I have to say;
p399
aVI don't know what I can say;
p400
aVI don't know what I'm supposed to do.
p401
aVAnd out of that sense of failure,
p402
aVI remember, I would always examine the patient.
p403
aVI would pull down the eyelids.
p404
aVI would look at the tongue.
p405
aVI would percuss the chest. I would listen to the heart.
p406
aVI would feel the abdomen.
p407
aVI remember so many patients,
p408
aVtheir names still vivid on my tongue,
p409
aVtheir faces still so clear.
p410
aVI remember so many huge, hollowed out, haunted eyes
p411
aVstaring up at me as I performed this ritual.
p412
aVAnd then the next day,
p413
aVI would come, and I would do it again.
p414
aa(lp415
VAnd I wanted to read you this one closing passage
p416
aVabout one patient.
p417
aV"I recall one patient
p418
aVwho was at that point
p419
aVno more than a skeleton
p420
aVencased in shrinking skin,
p421
aVunable to speak,
p422
aVhis mouth crusted with candida
p423
aVthat was resistant to the usual medications.
p424
aVWhen he saw me
p425
aVon what turned out to be his last hours on this earth,
p426
aVhis hands moved as if in slow motion.
p427
aVAnd as I wondered what he was up to,
p428
aVhis stick fingers made their way
p429
aVup to his pajama shirt,
p430
aVfumbling with his buttons.
p431
aVI realized that he was wanting
p432
aVto expose his wicker-basket chest to me.
p433
aVIt was an offering, an invitation.
p434
aVI did not decline.
p435
aa(lp436
VI percussed. I palpated. I listened to the chest.
p437
aVI think he surely must have known by then
p438
aVthat it was vital for me
p439
aVjust as it was necessary for him.
p440
aVNeither of us could skip this ritual,
p441
aVwhich had nothing to do with detecting rales in the lung,
p442
aVor finding the gallop rhythm of heart failure.
p443
aVNo, this ritual was about the one message
p444
aVthat physicians have needed to convey to their patients.
p445
aVAlthough, God knows, of late, in our hubris,
p446
aVwe seem to have drifted away.
p447
aVWe seem to have forgotten \u2014
p448
aVas though, with the explosion of knowledge,
p449
aVthe whole human genome mapped out at our feet,
p450
aVwe are lulled into inattention,
p451
aVforgetting that the ritual is cathartic to the physician,
p452
aVnecessary for the patient \u2014
p453
aVforgetting that the ritual has meaning
p454
aVand a singular message to convey to the patient.
p455
aa(lp456
VAnd the message, which I didn't fully understand then,
p457
aVeven as I delivered it,
p458
aVand which I understand better now is this:
p459
aVI will always, always, always be there.
p460
aVI will see you through this.
p461
aVI will never abandon you.
p462
aVI will be with you through the end."
p463
aa(lp464
VThank you very much.
p465
aa(lp466
V(Applause)

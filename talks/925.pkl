VI am a marine toxicologist,
p5
aVand I've been very, very concerned about the Gulf,
p6
aVparticularly about the massive applications
p7
aVof the toxic dispersants,
p8
aVthe Corexits.
p9
aVI've been working on ocean pollution
p10
aVfor quite a long time \u2014
p11
aVthe impacts on marine life and particularly the impacts
p12
aVon marine mammals.
p13
aVAs it turns out, marine mammals
p14
aVare at the top of this food chain
p15
aVthat we're pouring millions of tons
p16
aVof toxic substances into
p17
aVevery year.
p18
aVAnd they are showing the signs of this.
p19
aVI'm sorry to have a sad slide like this,
p20
aVbut not everything is all that happy,
p21
aVespecially in my work.
p22
aVThey are loaded
p23
aVwith toxic chemicals in their body,
p24
aVhundreds of compounds,
p25
aVall kinds of compounds \u2014 it's staggering.
p26
aVAnd they're dying off rather regularly,
p27
aVtens of thousands around the world.
p28
aVIt's predicted they may go extinct \u2014
p29
aVabout a third of them \u2014
p30
aVwithin about 30 years.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo my project is along the Northwest Atlantic.
p33
aVIt's called Seals as Sentinels.
p34
aVWe're tracking pollution
p35
aVat the top of the food web, in marine mammals and fish.
p36
aVIt's a region-wide,
p37
aVeco-toxicological investigation.
p38
aVWe're looking at a lot of compounds,
p39
aVbut recently been quite interested in
p40
aVthe flame retardants, the brominated flame retardants
p41
aVthat are in many, many things
p42
aVthat we use in our everyday life,
p43
aVfrom the cushions in the chairs
p44
aVwe're all sitting on
p45
aVto the plastic casings of our computers,
p46
aVour television sets and so on.
p47
aVSo we are tracking
p48
aVhow do these things get from
p49
aVthe products into the ocean,
p50
aVwhich is the final sink for them.
p51
aVAnd there's quite a complicated pathway for that
p52
aVbecause, as these products age,
p53
aVthey get concentrated in dust,
p54
aVand then they also get thrown out, so they go to the landfills.
p55
aVThey wind up in waste water treatment plants.
p56
aVAs you all know, we throw out billions
p57
aVof computers and TVs every year.
p58
aVAnd those go to e-waste dumps.
p59
aVAnd all that gets into surface waters,
p60
aVeventually reaching the ocean, the final sink.
p61
aVSo, in our study,
p62
aVwe did find quite high levels, as we expected,
p63
aVof these flame retardants in the harbor seals' bodies.
p64
aVAnd we reported this.
p65
aVIt led to a ban of this neuro-toxic flame retardant
p66
aVcalled Deca in Maine, where I am based,
p67
aVand also then a phase-out,
p68
aVU.S.-wide, at the end of last year.
p69
aVBut we said, well, on the bright side,
p70
aVour harbor seals at least will not be
p71
aVbursting into flame anytime soon.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo then I got really curious,
p74
aVmyself, as a toxicologist,
p75
aVand I donated some blood to my lab
p76
aVand said, "Okay, let's do it."
p77
aVWell, we detected 113 different compounds
p78
aVin my blood.
p79
aVAnd I must say, if any of you would have this done,
p80
aVyou'd probably find a similar profile,
p81
aVor cocktail, as they call it.
p82
aVBut I was the recipient
p83
aVof a lot of flame retardant material for some reason.
p84
aVAnd just to point out the levels \u2014
p85
aVAmericans have 10 to 40 times higher
p86
aVlevels of these compounds in our bodies
p87
aVthan the Europeans.
p88
aVWhy? Because we are flame-retarding everything,
p89
aVand we have weak regulations
p90
aVfor toxic chemicals.
p91
aVBut lo and behold, I'm one of the high-end individuals.
p92
aVLucky me.
p93
aVBut then I thought,
p94
aVwell, in case of a fire, I might be the last one to ignite.
p95
aa(lp96
V(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
VSo anyway, here's the problem \u2014
p99
aVand it is a problem that we're looking at in the Gulf today \u2014
p100
aVwe're not regulating chemicals in this country properly.
p101
aVWe're hardly regulating them at all.
p102
aVAnd we're letting industry run the show.
p103
aVAnd Jackie Savitz spoke this morning
p104
aVabout Big Oil
p105
aVand the propaganda
p106
aVand how we're all brainwashed
p107
aVwith their, you know, lies and so forth.
p108
aVWell, Big Chemical
p109
aVis what we're dealing with here.
p110
aVAnd they're allowed to keep trade secrets,
p111
aVso they don't even give the ingredients out.
p112
aVPlus they don't give health and safety data,
p113
aVso, consequently, they cannot be regulated
p114
aVbefore they go to market.
p115
aVSo it's a case of innocent until proven guilty.
p116
aVThe burden of proof is not on the producer.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo I then was invited to go
p119
aVto the Gulf in May.
p120
aVI went down there on
p121
aVa preliminary investigation
p122
aVto look into dispersants
p123
aVand how they're going into the water column and so forth.
p124
aVAnd I was told that I was
p125
aVthe only toxicologist to date
p126
aVwho was dumb enough to get into the water,
p127
aVbut I did.
p128
aVAnd we dove in the slick
p129
aVwithout even HazMat gear.
p130
aVAnd I did get sick.
p131
aVI got a ferocious sore throat two days later.
p132
aVI felt like my throat was on fire.
p133
aVBut it did pass.
p134
aVAnd what I did see in the water as we went down,
p135
aVwhat really shocked me \u2014 and it's haunted me ever since \u2014
p136
aVbecause I could see the droplets of oil dispersing.
p137
aVAnd as you go down, they're catching all kinds of plankton,
p138
aVbumping into,
p139
aVyou know, little wisps of life
p140
aVthat are the food for the planktivores,
p141
aVthe herring kind of fish.
p142
aVAnd you could just see the web of death
p143
aVas you go down in the water column.
p144
aa(lp145
VWell, you know, we got into this
p146
aVin the beginning
p147
aVas a trade-off, they say,
p148
aVbetween the wetlands versus the ocean depth.
p149
aVAnd I didn't agree with that
p150
aVdecision at the time; I still don't.
p151
aVThe decision was to protect the marshes.
p152
aVWhen the oil gets into the marshes, you can't get it out.
p153
aVAnd as you know, there's been a very weak response,
p154
aVup until recently,
p155
aVto actually collect the oil.
p156
aVIt's gotten much more aggressive.
p157
aVThis is an Exxon slide showing what happens,
p158
aVthe scenario and the trade-off.
p159
aVSo this shows oil on the surface.
p160
aVYou can see it getting up into the mangrove,
p161
aVbut it is not harming the corals
p162
aVor the sea grass, right.
p163
aVSo here we have the other scenario.
p164
aVIf you disperse, the sea grass and the corals
p165
aVare getting hit pretty hard,
p166
aVbut you're saving the mangrove.
p167
aVSo this, to me, is like going to the eye doctor, okay?
p168
aVIs it better with one or two?
p169
aa(lp170
V(Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
VThe problem is that we have
p173
aVreleased so darn much of this stuff,
p174
aVwe're climbing up to two million gallons
p175
aVvery quickly.
p176
aVAnd then there's the problem of the plumes.
p177
aVWhat plumes?
p178
aVIt turns out there are plumes.
p179
aVIndependent researchers found that.
p180
aVAnd then there's the looming,
p181
aVmessy problem of human health,
p182
aVreported human health effects.
p183
aVAnd actually, one of our federal officials
p184
aVsaid that it was probably heat stress. So ...
p185
aVHaving been in that water
p186
aVjust for the short time I was there,
p187
aVI can tell you, it is not heat stress.
p188
aVThere are volumes of volatile
p189
aVpetroleum fumes coming off that water,
p190
aVplus the Corexit,
p191
aVwhich has solvent in it.
p192
aVSo it is not at all rational.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo what do we have? The BP show is going on.
p195
aVOur officials complained about Corexit,
p196
aVwhich is the most toxic
p197
aVline of dispersants.
p198
aVBut heck, they're still using it,
p199
aVand they used the most toxic one, the 9527,
p200
aVuntil they ran out of supplies.
p201
aVNow they're on 9500.
p202
aV9527 had 2-butoxyethanol in it
p203
aVthat causes internal bleeding.
p204
aVWe know that from the Exxon Valdez spill, by the way.
p205
aVSo what we're doing, we're putting compounds
p206
aVwith petroleum solvents onto a petroleum spill.
p207
aVDoes this make sense?
p208
aVSo this is the way it works.
p209
aVAnd I want to show you this cute little thing that happens here.
p210
aVIt's a micelle.
p211
aVMicelles form around the oil.
p212
aVAnd what happens first
p213
aVis the solvents break into the oil,
p214
aVthe lipid membrane,
p215
aVthey let the surfactants in there.
p216
aVThe surfactants \u2014 which are like things
p217
aVwe use on fast food wrappers \u2014
p218
aVthey grab around the droplets of oil,
p219
aVand they make little, tiny droplets
p220
aVwith nice, little
p221
aVsurfactant edges to them.
p222
aVThe thing to remember about the micelles \u2014
p223
aVthese little floating
p224
aVglobules of toxin \u2014
p225
aVis they are there to deliver.
p226
aVThey're like the FedEx guys.
p227
aVAnd if you're a fish,
p228
aVand you haven't gotten your glob in the morning,
p229
aVyou're going to get it in the afternoon,
p230
aVbecause they've got your number.
p231
aa(lp232
VSo from a toxicology perspective,
p233
aVthis is really awful
p234
aVbecause Corexit and the dispersed oil
p235
aVare much more toxic together
p236
aVthan either alone.
p237
aVAnd usually the exposure
p238
aVis a combined exposure.
p239
aVThe dispersants \u2014 as I was saying \u2014
p240
aVtheir job is to break down
p241
aVthe lipid membrane.
p242
aVThe solvents in them do that very efficiently.
p243
aVSo they break down
p244
aVlipid membranes in our body,
p245
aVstarting with cells of the skin,
p246
aVthe cells of organs.
p247
aVSo it actually hastens
p248
aVoil getting into the body
p249
aVeasily and readily.
p250
aVOil contains hundreds of hydrocarbon compounds
p251
aVand other compounds
p252
aVthat are toxic to every organ in the body.
p253
aVAnd so with the dispersants combined,
p254
aVyou have this very synergistic
p255
aVcombined toxicity.
p256
aVCorexit also contains petroleum solvents
p257
aVand many other toxic compounds.
p258
aVAnd I'm part of a chat group,
p259
aVwhich is a national group
p260
aVof toxicologists and chemists
p261
aVthat are, you know, basically
p262
aVturning cartwheels trying to figure out what's in this stuff,
p263
aVand what is it doing and what are the interactions
p264
aVof these chemicals, most of which we don't know,
p265
aVand what are their byproducts,
p266
aVwhich are usually more toxic than the parent compound.
p267
aVSo we did find that Corexit 9500
p268
aVcontains heavy metals, arsenic and chromium \u2014
p269
aVarsenic at high enough levels
p270
aVto have cancer-causing effects.
p271
aa(lp272
VSo this is what we have to look at,
p273
aVthese, you know, ridiculous safety data sheets,
p274
aVwhich have nothing on them much.
p275
aVAnd now they were forced to release the ultimate list
p276
aVof everything that's in Corexit.
p277
aVAnd guess what,
p278
aVtons of stuff is missing.
p279
aVDerivatives, derivatives, these are whole big groups
p280
aVof many, many compounds, these sorbitans.
p281
aVAnd then you get down to the petroleum distillates,
p282
aVwhich are the solvents,
p283
aVhundreds of them.
p284
aVThey are not identified. And why?
p285
aVTrade secrets again.
p286
aVBP's running the show,
p287
aVand the Nalco company, this is all they have to do.
p288
aVSo far these ingredients have not been released,
p289
aVand toxicologists are actually going nuts
p290
aVbecause we cannot predict with certainty
p291
aVwhat the interactions
p292
aVand toxic results are going to be.
p293
aa(lp294
VBut we do have quite a lot at risk
p295
aVdown there, as we all know,
p296
aVthe 33 wildlife refuges,
p297
aVso much wildlife
p298
aVand fish and diversity.
p299
aVSo we know from previous spills.
p300
aVAnd then part of this is just
p301
aVpart of my bad dreams.
p302
aVAnd I appreciate being able
p303
aVto vent some of my
p304
aVanguish upon you.
p305
aVWhat we do know is that the corals are going to get hit hard.
p306
aVAnd this is a study that was done
p307
aVon the Australian coast,
p308
aVthe coast of Tasmania.
p309
aVCorals are, you know, the home to
p310
aVabout a quarter of all marine species.
p311
aVAnd with the Corexit
p312
aVand the oil,
p313
aVthere's zero percent fertilization.
p314
aVWith oil alone, there's 98 percent fertilization.
p315
aVSo they're a very sensitive species
p316
aVto this combo.
p317
aa(lp318
VHere's another group.
p319
aVI could see myself easily in the water column.
p320
aVThe plankton and the plankton eaters,
p321
aVyou know, these are the little herring fish
p322
aVthat go through the water column with their mouths open,
p323
aVfeeding indiscriminately
p324
aVand just lapping up
p325
aVthis brown pudding of toxic stuff.
p326
aVAnd we do know from other studies
p327
aVthat this is a highly toxic mixture.
p328
aVSee the oil and Corexit is causing death
p329
aVat a much, much lower dose
p330
aVthan oil alone.
p331
aVThat's probably as far as what we do know
p332
aVabout toxic effects.
p333
aVBut my bad dreams go like this.
p334
aVThe piscivorous fish,
p335
aVthe cobia, grouper, amberjacks, those big fish,
p336
aValso the tuna and sharks,
p337
aVare going to hit by this.
p338
aVAnd the gills are quite sensitive.
p339
aVThe respiratory system is very sensitive.
p340
aVThink about it with
p341
aVthe Corexit hitting the membranes,
p342
aVand it will clog up the gills,
p343
aVand then these animals are going to be
p344
aVgetting something like what you call
p345
aVchemical pneumonia,
p346
aVtrying to aspirate the compounds.
p347
aVIt also will cause internal bleeding
p348
aVupon ingestion.
p349
aVI'm very worried about the air-breathing mammals because I study them,
p350
aVbut also, the way their going to be exposed
p351
aVis every time they come to the surface to take a breath,
p352
aVthey're going to inhale these volatile fumes.
p353
aVAnd what does happen with that eventually
p354
aVis pneumonia sets in
p355
aVand liver, kidney, brain damage.
p356
aVThe Corexit
p357
aVis transporting the oil
p358
aVinto every membrane
p359
aVand every system of the body.
p360
aVAnd you're having
p361
aVa lot of different unpleasant effects,
p362
aVbut burns to the eyes and mouth,
p363
aVskin ulcers, lesions.
p364
aVAnd I think, personally,
p365
aVthat we have not begun to see
p366
aVthe impacts of this spill
p367
aVon the wildlife of the Gulf.
p368
aa(lp369
VWe started hypothesizing:
p370
aVwhat do we know?
p371
aVwhat do with think would be a trophic cascade?
p372
aVwhich means that somebody gets wiped out,
p373
aVand then everything above
p374
aVthat's eating those guys will crash.
p375
aVSo our thought was \u2014
p376
aVthis is a simple thinking process, but ...
p377
aVobviously the plankton, the planktivores,
p378
aVand that's about as far as we got.
p379
aVAnd then it turns out we're not very good at figuring this stuff out.
p380
aVThis is what the Exxon Valdez scientists thought would happen,
p381
aVthis trophic cascade
p382
aVwhere you lose the kelp and the herring
p383
aVand other fishes and going up.
p384
aVThey thought that eventually the killer whale
p385
aVwould be at the top of this cascade.
p386
aVAnd then here's what really happened,
p387
aVmuch more complicated, much more specific.
p388
aVActually the kelp
p389
aVand the barnacles that attach to the rock
p390
aVwere decimated by the combination
p391
aVof Corexit and the oil.
p392
aVThey were replaced by invasive species,
p393
aVwhich had less holding power to the rock.
p394
aVStorms came along.
p395
aVThey ripped out of the rock.
p396
aVAnd this was the entire food web for the sea ducks.
p397
aVAnd as you know, we lost about 300,000 sea ducks
p398
aVfrom the Exxon Valdez spill,
p399
aVand they haven't come back.
p400
aa(lp401
VSo we are launching
p402
aVan independent study.
p403
aVAnd by independent, I do not mean alone;
p404
aVI mean independent in the sense
p405
aVof not tied to
p406
aVthe kind of crime-scene secrecy
p407
aVthat's going on in the Gulf now.
p408
aVBut we are actually going to be assessing toxic impacts,
p409
aVbut we need lots and lots of partners
p410
aVto do this intelligently.
p411
aVWe have some of the partners lined up.
p412
aVAnd Dave Gallo signed on.
p413
aVSylvia's in here.
p414
aVAnd we hope that some of you will help us.
p415
aVMy question to you is: why shouldn't we know?
p416
aVDon't we have the right to know?
p417
aVSurely we have the right to learn
p418
aVwhat loss we are going through in the Gulf.
p419
aVAnd my wish would be \u2014
p420
aVfor the gulf prize \u2014 would be
p421
aVthat we have the truth.
p422
aVWhatever it is, please let us have the truth.
p423
aVAnd to get there,
p424
aVwe need to do the assessment.
p425
aa(lp426
VSo I appreciate being here. Thank you.

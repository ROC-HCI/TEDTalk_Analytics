VI was asked to come here and speak about creation.
p5
aVAnd I only have 15 minutes, and I see they're counting already.
p6
aVAnd I can \u2014 in 15 minutes, I think I can touch only a very rather janitorial branch of creation,
p7
aVwhich I call "creativity."
p8
aVCreativity is how we cope with creation.
p9
aVWhile creation sometimes seems a bit un-graspable, or even pointless,
p10
aVcreativity is always meaningful.
p11
aVSee, for instance, in this picture.
p12
aVYou know, creation is what put that dog in that picture,
p13
aVand creativity is what makes us see a chicken on his hindquarters.
p14
aa(lp15
VWhen you think about \u2014 you know, creativity has a lot to do with causality too.
p16
aVYou know, when I was a teenager, I was a creator.
p17
aVI just did things.
p18
aVThen I became an adult and started knowing who I was,
p19
aVand tried to maintain that persona \u2014 I became creative.
p20
aVIt wasn't until I actually did a book and a retrospective exhibition, that I could track exactly \u2014
p21
aVlooks like all the craziest things that I had done, all my drinking, all my parties \u2014
p22
aVthey followed a straight line that brings me to the point
p23
aVthat actually I'm talking to you at this moment.
p24
aVThough it's actually true, you know,
p25
aVthe reason I'm talking to you right now is because I was born in Brazil.
p26
aVIf I was born in Monterey, probably would be in Brazil.
p27
aa(lp28
VYou know, I was born in Brazil and grew up in the '70s
p29
aVunder a climate of political distress,
p30
aVand I was forced to learn to communicate in a very specific way \u2014
p31
aVin a sort of a semiotic black market.
p32
aVYou couldn't really say what you wanted to say;
p33
aVyou had to invent ways of doing it.
p34
aVYou didn't trust information very much.
p35
aVThat led me to another step of why I'm here today,
p36
aVis because I really liked media of all kinds.
p37
aVI was a media junkie, and eventually got involved with advertising.
p38
aVMy first job in Brazil
p39
aVwas actually to develop a way to improve the readability of billboards,
p40
aVand based on speed, angle of approach and actually blocks of text.
p41
aVIt was very \u2014 actually, it was a very good study,
p42
aVand got me a job in an ad agency.
p43
aVAnd they also decided that I had to \u2014
p44
aVto give me a very ugly Plexiglas trophy for it.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd another point \u2014 why I'm here \u2014
p47
aVis that the day I went to pick up the Plexiglas trophy,
p48
aVI rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life,
p49
aVpicked the thing \u2014 didn't have any friends.
p50
aVOn my way out, I had to break a fight apart.
p51
aVSomebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles.
p52
aVThey were in tuxedos, and fighting. It was very ugly.
p53
aVAnd also \u2014 advertising people do that all the time \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p54
aVand I \u2014 well, what happened is when I went back, it was on the way back to my car,
p55
aVthe guy who got hit decided to grab a gun \u2014
p56
aVI don't know why he had a gun \u2014
p57
aVand shoot the first person he decided to be his aggressor.
p58
aVThe first person was wearing a black tie, a tuxedo. It was me.
p59
aVLuckily, it wasn't fatal, as you can all see.
p60
aVAnd, even more luckily, the guy said that he was sorry
p61
aVand I bribed him for compensation money, otherwise I press charges.
p62
aVAnd that's how \u2014 with this money I paid for a ticket to come to the United States in 1983,
p63
aVand that's very \u2014 the basic reason I'm talking to you here today:
p64
aVbecause I got shot. (Laughter) (Applause)
p65
aa(lp66
VWell, when I started working with my own work, I decided that I shouldn't do images.
p67
aVYou know, I became \u2014 I took this very iconoclastic approach.
p68
aVBecause when I decided to go into advertising, I wanted to do \u2014
p69
aVI wanted to airbrush naked people on ice, for whiskey commercials,
p70
aVthat's what I really wanted to do. (Laughter)
p71
aVBut I \u2014 they didn't let me do it, so I just \u2014 you know,
p72
aVthey would only let me do other things.
p73
aVBut I wasn't into selling whiskey; I was into selling ice.
p74
aVThe first works were actually objects.
p75
aVIt was kind of a mixture of found object, product design and advertising.
p76
aVAnd I called them relics.
p77
aVThey were displayed first at Stux Gallery in 1983.
p78
aa(lp79
VThis is the clown skull.
p80
aVIs a remnant of a race of \u2014 a very evolved race of entertainers.
p81
aVThey lived in Brazil, long time ago. (Laughter)
p82
aVThis is the Ashanti joystick.
p83
aVUnfortunately, it has become obsolete because it was designed for Atari platform.
p84
aVA Playstation II is in the works, maybe for the next TED I'll bring it.
p85
aVThe rocking podium. (Laughter)
p86
aVThis is the pre-Columbian coffeemaker. (Laughter)
p87
aVActually, the idea came out of an argument that I had at Starbucks,
p88
aVthat I insisted that I wasn't having Colombian coffee;
p89
aVthe coffee was actually pre-Columbian.
p90
aVThe Bonsai table.
p91
aVThe entire Encyclopedia Britannica bound in a single volume, for travel purposes.
p92
aVAnd the half tombstone, for people who are not dead yet.
p93
aa(lp94
VI wanted to take that into the realm of images,
p95
aVand I decided to make things that had the same identity conflicts.
p96
aVSo I decided to do work with clouds.
p97
aVBecause clouds can mean anything you want.
p98
aVBut now I wanted to work in a very low-tech way,
p99
aVso something that would mean at the same time
p100
aVa lump of cotton, a cloud and Durer's praying hands \u2014
p101
aValthough this looks a lot more like Mickey Mouse's praying hands.
p102
aVBut I was still, you know \u2014 this is a kitty cloud.
p103
aVThey're called "Equivalents," after Alfred Stieglitz's work.
p104
aV"The Snail."
p105
aVBut I was still working with sculpture,
p106
aVand I was really trying to go flatter and flatter.
p107
aV"The Teapot."
p108
aa(lp109
VI had a chance to go to Florence, in \u2014 I think it was '94,
p110
aVand I saw Ghiberti's "Door of Paradise."
p111
aVAnd he did something that was very tricky.
p112
aVHe put together two different media from different periods of time.
p113
aVFirst, he got an age-old way of making it, which was relief,
p114
aVand he worked this with three-point perspective, which was brand-new technology at the time.
p115
aVAnd it's totally overkill.
p116
aVAnd your eye doesn't know which level to read.
p117
aVAnd you become trapped into this kind of representation.
p118
aVSo I decided to make these very simple renderings,
p119
aVthat at first they are taken as a line drawing \u2014
p120
aVyou know, something that's very \u2014 and then I did it with wire.
p121
aVThe idea was to \u2014 because everybody overlooks white \u2014 like pencil drawings, you know?
p122
aVAnd they would look at it \u2014 "Ah, it's a pencil drawing."
p123
aVThen you have this double take and see that it's actually something that existed in time.
p124
aVIt had a physicality,
p125
aVand you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative
p126
aVthat goes this way, towards the image. So this is "Monkey with Leica."
p127
aV"Relaxation."
p128
aV"Fiat Lux."
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd the same way the history of representation
p131
aVevolved from line drawings to shaded drawings.
p132
aVAnd I wanted to deal with other subjects.
p133
aVI started taking that into the realm of landscape,
p134
aVwhich is something that's almost a picture of nothing.
p135
aVI made these pictures called "Pictures of Thread,"
p136
aVand I named them after the amount of yards that I used to represent each picture.
p137
aVThese always end up being a photograph at the end,
p138
aVor more like an etching in this case.
p139
aVSo this is a lighthouse.
p140
aVThis is "6,500 Yards," after Corot. "9,000 Yards," after Gerhard Richter.
p141
aVAnd I don't know how many yards, after John Constable.
p142
aa(lp143
VDeparting from the lines, I decided to tackle the idea of points,
p144
aVlike which is more similar to the type of representation that we find in photographs themselves.
p145
aVI had met a group of children in the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts,
p146
aVand I did work and play with them.
p147
aVI got some photographs from them.
p148
aVUpon my arrival in New York, I decided \u2014
p149
aVthey were children of sugar plantation workers.
p150
aVAnd by manipulating sugar over a black paper, I made portraits of them.
p151
aVThese are \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p152
aVThank you. This is "Valentina, the Fastest."
p153
aVIt was just the name of the child,
p154
aVwith the little thing you get to know of somebody that you meet very briefly.
p155
aV"Valicia."
p156
aV"Jacynthe."
p157
aa(lp158
VBut another layer of representation was still introduced.
p159
aVBecause I was doing this while I was making these pictures,
p160
aVI realized that I could add still another thing
p161
aVI was trying to make a subject \u2014
p162
aVsomething that would interfere with the themes,
p163
aVso chocolate is very good, because it has \u2014
p164
aVit brings to mind ideas that go from scatology to romance.
p165
aVAnd so I decided to make these pictures,
p166
aVand they were very large, so you had to walk away from it to be able to see them.
p167
aVSo they're called "Pictures of Chocolate."
p168
aVFreud probably could explain chocolate better than I. He was the first subject.
p169
aVAnd Jackson Pollock also.
p170
aa(lp171
VPictures of crowds are particularly interesting,
p172
aVbecause, you know, you go to that \u2014
p173
aVyou try to figure out the threshold with something you can define very easily,
p174
aVlike a face, goes into becoming just a texture.
p175
aV"Paparazzi."
p176
aVI used the dust at the Whitney Museum to render some pieces of their collection.
p177
aVAnd I picked minimalist pieces because they're about specificity.
p178
aVAnd you render this with the most non-specific material,
p179
aVwhich is dust itself.
p180
aVLike, you know, you have the skin particles of every single museum visitor.
p181
aVThey do a DNA scan of this, they will come up with a great mailing list.
p182
aVThis is Richard Serra.
p183
aa(lp184
VI bought a computer, and [they] told me it had millions of colors in it.
p185
aVYou know an artist's first response to this is, who counted it? You know?
p186
aVAnd I realized that I never worked with color,
p187
aVbecause I had a hard time controlling the idea of single colors.
p188
aVBut once they're applied to numeric structure,
p189
aVthen you can feel more comfortable.
p190
aVSo the first time I worked with colors was by making these mosaics of Pantone swatches.
p191
aVThey end up being very large pictures,
p192
aVand I photographed with a very large camera \u2014
p193
aVan 8x10 camera.
p194
aVSo you can see the surface of every single swatch \u2014
p195
aVlike in this picture of Chuck Close.
p196
aVAnd you have to walk very far to be able to see it.
p197
aVAlso, the reference to Gerhard Richter's use of color charts \u2014
p198
aVand the idea also entering another realm of representation that's very common to us today,
p199
aVwhich is the bit map.
p200
aVI ended up narrowing the subject to Monet's "Haystacks."
p201
aa(lp202
VThis is something I used to do as a joke \u2014
p203
aVyou know, make \u2014 the same like \u2014 Robert Smithson's "Spiral Jetty" \u2014
p204
aVand then leaving traces, as if it was done on a tabletop.
p205
aVI tried to prove that he didn't do that thing in the Salt Lake.
p206
aVBut then, just doing the models, I was trying to explore the relationship
p207
aVbetween the model and the original.
p208
aVAnd I felt that I would have to actually go there and make some earthworks myself.
p209
aVI opt for very simple line drawings \u2014 kind of stupid looking.
p210
aa(lp211
VAnd at the same time, I was doing these very large constructions,
p212
aVbeing 150 meters away.
p213
aVNow I would do very small ones, which would be like \u2014
p214
aVbut under the same light, and I would show them together,
p215
aVso the viewer would have to really figure it out what one he was looking.
p216
aVI wasn't interested in the very large things, or in the small things.
p217
aVI was more interested in the things in between,
p218
aVyou know, because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there.
p219
aVThis is like you see \u2014 the size of a person over there.
p220
aVThis is a pipe.
p221
aVA hanger.
p222
aa(lp223
VAnd this is another thing that I did \u2014 you know working
p224
aV\u2014 everybody loves to watch somebody draw,
p225
aVbut not many people have a chance to watch somebody draw in \u2014
p226
aVa lot of people at the same time, to evidence a single drawing.
p227
aVAnd I love this work,
p228
aVbecause I did these cartoonish clouds over Manhattan for a period of two months.
p229
aVAnd it was quite wonderful, because I had an interest \u2014 an early interest \u2014 in theater,
p230
aVthat's justified on this thing.
p231
aVIn theater, you have the character and the actor in the same place,
p232
aVtrying to negotiate each other in front of an audience.
p233
aVAnd in this, you'd have like a \u2014
p234
aVsomething that looks like a cloud, and it is a cloud at the same time.
p235
aVSo they're like perfect actors.
p236
aa(lp237
VMy interest in acting, especially bad acting, goes a long way.
p238
aVActually, I once paid like 60 dollars
p239
aVto see a very great actor to do a version of "King Lear,"
p240
aVand I felt really robbed, because by the time the actor started being King Lear,
p241
aVhe stopped being the great actor that I had paid money to see.
p242
aVOn the other hand, you know, I paid like three dollars, I think \u2014
p243
aVand I went to a warehouse in Queens
p244
aVto see a version of "Othello" by an amateur group.
p245
aVAnd it was quite fascinating, because you know the guy \u2014
p246
aVhis name was Joey Grimaldi \u2014
p247
aVhe impersonated the Moorish general
p248
aV\u2014 you know, for the first three minutes he was really that general,
p249
aVand then he went back into plumber, he worked as a plumber, so \u2014
p250
aVplumber, general, plumber, general \u2014
p251
aVso for three dollars, I saw two tragedies for the price of one.
p252
aa(lp253
VSee, I think it's not really about impression,
p254
aVmaking people fall for a really perfect illusion,
p255
aVas much as it is to make \u2014 I usually work at the lowest threshold of visual illusion.
p256
aVBecause it's not about fooling somebody,
p257
aVit's actually giving somebody a measure of their own belief:
p258
aVhow much you want to be fooled.
p259
aVThat's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that.
p260
aVWell, I think that's it.
p261
aVMy time is nearly up.
p262
aVThank you very much.

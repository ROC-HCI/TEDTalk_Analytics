VIn 1994, I walked into a prison in Cambodia,
p5
aVand I met a 12-year-old boy
p6
aVwho had been tortured
p7
aVand was denied access to counsel.
p8
aVAnd as I looked into his eyes, I realized
p9
aVthat for the hundreds of letters I had written
p10
aVfor political prisoners, that I would never have
p11
aVwritten a letter for him,
p12
aVbecause he was not a 12-year-old boy who
p13
aVhad done something important for anybody.
p14
aVHe was not a political prisoner.
p15
aVHe was a 12-year-old boy who had
p16
aVstolen a bicycle.
p17
aVWhat I also realized at that point was that
p18
aVit was not only Cambodia, but
p19
aVof the 113
p20
aVdeveloping countries that torture,
p21
aV93 of these countries have all passed laws
p22
aVthat say you have a right to a lawyer
p23
aVand you have a right not to be tortured.
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd what I recognized was that there was an
p26
aVincredible window of opportunity for us
p27
aVas a world community to come together
p28
aVand end torture as an investigative tool.
p29
aVWe often think of torture as being
p30
aVpolitical torture or reserved for
p31
aVjust the worst, but, in fact,
p32
aV95 percent of torture today
p33
aVis not for political prisoners.
p34
aVIt is for people who are
p35
aVin broken-down legal systems,
p36
aVand unfortunately because torture is
p37
aVthe cheapest form of investigation \u2014
p38
aVit's cheaper than having a legal system,
p39
aVcheaper than having a lawyer
p40
aVand early access to counsel \u2014
p41
aVit is what happens most of the time.
p42
aVI believe today that it is possible for us
p43
aVas a world community, if we make a decision,
p44
aVto come together and end torture
p45
aVas an investigative tool in our lifetime,
p46
aVbut it will require three things.
p47
aVFirst is the training, empowerment,
p48
aVand connection of defenders worldwide.
p49
aa(lp50
VThe second is insuring that there is
p51
aVsystematic early access to counsel.
p52
aVAnd the third is commitment.
p53
aVSo in the year 2000,
p54
aVI began to wonder,
p55
aVwhat if we came together?
p56
aVCould we do something
p57
aVfor these 93 countries?
p58
aVAnd I founded International Bridges to Justice
p59
aVwhich has a specific mission of
p60
aVending torture as an investigative tool
p61
aVand implementing due process rights
p62
aVin the 93 countries by placing trained lawyers
p63
aVat an early stage in police stations
p64
aVand in courtrooms.
p65
aVMy first experiences, though, did come
p66
aVfrom Cambodia, and at the time I remember
p67
aVfirst coming to Cambodia and there were,
p68
aVin 1994, still less than
p69
aV10 attorneys in the country because
p70
aVthe Khmer Rouge had killed them all.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd even 20 years later, there was only
p73
aV10 lawyers in the country, so consequently
p74
aVyou'd walk into a prison and
p75
aVnot only would you meet 12-year-old boys,
p76
aVyou'd meet women and you'd say,
p77
aV"Why are you here?" Women would say,
p78
aV"Well I've been here for 10 years because
p79
aVmy husband committed a crime, but they can't find him."
p80
aVSo it's just a place where there was no rule of law.
p81
aa(lp82
VThe first group of defenders came together
p83
aVand I still remember, as I was training, I said,
p84
aV"Okay, what do you do for an investigation?"
p85
aVAnd there was silence in the class, and finally
p86
aVone woman stood up, [inaudible name],
p87
aVand she said "Khrew," which means "teacher."
p88
aVShe said, "I have defended more than
p89
aVa hundred people, and I've never had to do
p90
aVany investigation,
p91
aVbecause they all come with confessions."
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd we talked about, as a class, the fact that
p94
aVnumber one, the confessions
p95
aVmight not be reliable, but number two,
p96
aVwe did not want to encourage the police
p97
aVto keep doing this, especially
p98
aVas it was now against the law.
p99
aVAnd it took a lot of courage for these
p100
aVdefenders to decide that they would
p101
aVbegin to stand up and support each other
p102
aVin implementing these laws.
p103
aVAnd I still remember the first cases where
p104
aVthey came, all 25 together, she would
p105
aVstand up, and they were in the back, and
p106
aVthey would support her, and the judges kept
p107
aVsaying, "No, no, no, no, we're going to do things
p108
aVthe exact same way we've been doing them."
p109
aa(lp110
VBut one day the perfect case came, and it
p111
aVwas a woman who was a vegetable seller,
p112
aVshe was sitting outside of a house.
p113
aVShe said she actually saw the person
p114
aVrun out who she thinks stole
p115
aVwhatever the jewelry was, but the police
p116
aVcame, they got her, there was nothing on her.
p117
aVShe was pregnant at the time. She had
p118
aVcigarette burns on her. She'd miscarried.
p119
aVAnd when they brought her case
p120
aVto the judge, for the first time he stood up
p121
aVand he said, "Yes, there's no evidence
p122
aVexcept for your torture confession
p123
aVand you will be released."
p124
aa(lp125
VAnd the defenders began to take cases
p126
aVover and over again and
p127
aVyou will see, they have step by step began
p128
aVto change the course of history in Cambodia.
p129
aVBut Cambodia is not alone.
p130
aVI used to think, well is it Cambodia?
p131
aVOr is it other countries?
p132
aVBut it is in so many countries.
p133
aa(lp134
VIn Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn't
p135
aVa 12-year-old boy, it was an 8-year-old boy
p136
aVfor stealing a mobile phone.
p137
aVOr a woman, I picked up her baby,
p138
aVreally cute baby, I said "Your baby is so cute."
p139
aVIt wasn't a baby, she was three.
p140
aVAnd she said "Yeah, but she's why I'm here,"
p141
aVbecause she was accused of stealing
p142
aVtwo diapers and an iron for her baby and
p143
aVstill had been in prison.
p144
aVAnd when I walked up to the prison director,
p145
aVI said, "You've got to let her out.
p146
aVA judge would let her out."
p147
aVAnd he said, "Okay, we can talk about it,
p148
aVbut look at my prison. Eighty percent
p149
aVof the two thousand people here
p150
aVare without a lawyer. What can we do?"
p151
aVSo lawyers began to courageously
p152
aVstand up together to organize a system
p153
aVwhere they can take cases.
p154
aVBut we realized that it's not only the training
p155
aVof the lawyers, but the connection
p156
aVof the lawyers that makes a difference.
p157
aa(lp158
VFor example, in Cambodia, it was that
p159
aV[inaudible name] did not go alone
p160
aVbut she had 24 lawyers with her
p161
aVwho stood up together. And in the same way,
p162
aVin China, they always tell me,
p163
aV"It's like a fresh wind in the desert
p164
aVwhen we can come together."
p165
aVOr in Zimbabwe, where I remember Innocent,
p166
aVafter coming out of a prison where everybody
p167
aVstood up and said, "I've been here
p168
aVfor one year, eight years, 12 years
p169
aVwithout a lawyer,"
p170
aVhe came and we had a training together
p171
aVand he said, "I have heard it said" \u2014
p172
aVbecause he had heard people mumbling
p173
aVand grumbling \u2014 "I have heard it said that
p174
aVwe cannot help to create justice
p175
aVbecause we do not have the resources."
p176
aVAnd then he said, "But I want you to know
p177
aVthat the lack of resources
p178
aVis never an excuse for injustice."
p179
aVAnd with that, he successfully
p180
aVorganized 68 lawyers who have been
p181
aVsystematically taking the cases.
p182
aa(lp183
VThe key that we see, though, is training
p184
aVand then early access.
p185
aVI was recently in Egypt, and was inspired
p186
aVto meet with another group of lawyers,
p187
aVand what they told me is that they said,
p188
aV"Hey, look, we don't have police
p189
aVon the streets now. The police are
p190
aVone of the main reasons why we had
p191
aVthe revolution. They were torturing everybody
p192
aVall the time."
p193
aVAnd I said, "But there's been tens of millions
p194
aVof dollars that have recently gone in
p195
aVto the development of the legal system here.
p196
aVWhat's going on?"
p197
aVI met with one of the development agencies,
p198
aVand they were training prosecutors
p199
aVand judges, which is the normal bias,
p200
aVas opposed to defenders.
p201
aVAnd they showed me a manual which
p202
aVactually was an excellent manual.
p203
aVI said, "I'm gonna copy this."
p204
aVIt had everything in it. Lawyers can come
p205
aVat the police station. It was perfect.
p206
aVProsecutors were perfectly trained.
p207
aVBut I said to them, "I just have one question,
p208
aVwhich is, by the time that everybody got to
p209
aVthe prosecutor's office, what had happened to them?"
p210
aVAnd after a pause, they said,
p211
aV"They had been tortured."
p212
aa(lp213
VSo the pieces are,
p214
aVnot only the training of the lawyers, but
p215
aVus finding a way to systematically implement
p216
aVearly access to counsel, because they are
p217
aVthe safeguard in the system
p218
aVfor people who are being tortured.
p219
aVAnd as I tell you this, I'm also aware of the
p220
aVfact that it sounds like, "Oh, okay, it sounds
p221
aVlike we could do it, but can we really do it?"
p222
aVBecause it sounds big.
p223
aVAnd there are many reasons why I believe it's possible.
p224
aVThe first reason is the people on the ground
p225
aVwho find ways of creating miracles
p226
aVbecause of their commitment.
p227
aVIt's not only Innocent, who I told you about
p228
aVin Zimbabwe, but defenders all over the world
p229
aVwho are looking for these pieces.
p230
aVWe have a program called JusticeMakers,
p231
aVand we realized there are people that are
p232
aVcourageous and want to do things, but
p233
aVhow can we support them?
p234
aVSo it's an online contest where it's only
p235
aVfive thousand dollars if you come up with
p236
aVand innovative way of implementing justice.
p237
aVAnd there are 30 JusticeMakers
p238
aVthroughout the world, from Sri Lanka
p239
aVto Swaziland to the DRC, who with
p240
aVfive thousand dollars do amazing things,
p241
aVthrough SMS programs,
p242
aVthrough paralegal programs,
p243
aVthrough whatever they can do.
p244
aa(lp245
VAnd it's not only these JusticeMakers,
p246
aVbut people we courageously see
p247
aVfigure out who their networks are
p248
aVand how they can move it forward.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo in China, for instance, great laws
p251
aVcame out where it says police cannot
p252
aVtorture people or they will be punished.
p253
aVAnd I was sitting side by side with one of our
p254
aVvery courageous lawyers, and said,
p255
aV"How can we get this out? How can we
p256
aVmake sure that this is implemented?
p257
aVThis is fantastic." And he said to me,
p258
aV"Well, do you have money?" And I said,
p259
aV"No." And he said, "That's okay,
p260
aVwe can still figure it out."
p261
aVAnd on December 4, he organized
p262
aVthree thousand members
p263
aVof the Youth Communist League,
p264
aVfrom 14 of the top law schools,
p265
aVwho organized themselves, developed
p266
aVposters with the new laws, and went
p267
aVto the police stations and began what he says
p268
aVis a non-violent legal revolution
p269
aVto protect citizen rights.
p270
aVSo I talked about the fact that we need
p271
aVto train and support defenders.
p272
aVWe need to systematically implement
p273
aVearly access to counsel.
p274
aVBut the third and most important thing is that
p275
aVwe make a commitment to this.
p276
aa(lp277
VAnd people often say to me, "You know,
p278
aVthis is great, but it's wildly idealistic.
p279
aVNever going to happen."
p280
aVAnd the reason that I think that
p281
aVthose words are interesting is because
p282
aVthose were the same kinds of words
p283
aVthat were used for people who decided
p284
aVthey would end slavery, or end apartheid.
p285
aVIt began with a small group of people
p286
aVwho decided they would commit.
p287
aa(lp288
VNow, there's one of our favorite poems
p289
aVfrom the defenders, which they share
p290
aVfrom each other, is:
p291
aV"Take courage friends, the road is often long,
p292
aVthe path is never clear,
p293
aVand the stakes are very high,
p294
aVbut deep down, you are not alone."
p295
aVAnd I believe that if we can come together
p296
aVas a world community to support not only
p297
aVdefenders, but also everyone in the system
p298
aVwho is looking towards it,
p299
aVwe can end torture as an investigative tool.
p300
aVI end always, because I'm sure the questions are \u2014
p301
aVand I'd be happy to talk to you
p302
aVat any point \u2014 "But what can I really do?"
p303
aVWell, I would say this. First of all,
p304
aVyou know what you can do. But second of all,
p305
aVI would leave you with the story of Vishna,
p306
aVwho actually was my inspiration
p307
aVfor starting International Bridges to Justice.
p308
aa(lp309
VVishna was a 4-year-old boy when I met him
p310
aVwho was born in a Cambodian prison
p311
aVin Kandal Province. But because he was
p312
aVborn in the prison, everybody loved him,
p313
aVincluding the guards, so he was the only one
p314
aVwho was allowed to come
p315
aVin and out of the bars.
p316
aVSo, you know, there's bars. And by the time
p317
aVthat Vishna was getting bigger,
p318
aVwhich means what gets bigger? Your head gets bigger.
p319
aVSo he would come to the first bar,
p320
aVthe second bar and then the third bar,
p321
aVand then really slowly move his head
p322
aVso he could fit through, and come back,
p323
aVthird, second, first. And he would
p324
aVgrab my pinkie, because what he wanted
p325
aVto do every day is he wanted to go visit.
p326
aVYou know, he never quite made it to
p327
aVall of them every day, but he wanted to visit
p328
aVall 156 prisoners. And I would lift him,
p329
aVand he would put his fingers through.
p330
aVOr if they were dark cells, it was like iron
p331
aVcorrugated, and he would put his fingers through.
p332
aa(lp333
VAnd most of the prisoners said that he was
p334
aVtheir greatest joy and their sunshine, and they
p335
aVlooked forward to him. And I was like,
p336
aVhere's Vishna. He's a 4-year-old boy.
p337
aVHe was born in a prison with almost nothing,
p338
aVno material goods, but he had a sense of
p339
aVhis own heroic journey, which I believe
p340
aVwe are all born into. He said,
p341
aV"Probably I can't do everything.
p342
aVBut I'm one. I can do something.
p343
aVAnd I will do the one thing that I can do."
p344
aVSo I thank you for having the prophetic
p345
aVimagination to imagine the shaping
p346
aVof a new world with us together,
p347
aVand invite you into this journey with us.
p348
aa(lp349
VThank you.
p350
aa(lp351
V(Applause)
p352
aa(lp353
VThank you.
p354
aa(lp355
V(Applause)
p356
aa(lp357
VThank you.

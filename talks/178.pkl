VIn the next 18 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey.
p5
aVAnd it's a journey that you and I have been on for many years now,
p6
aVand it began some 50 years ago, when humans first stepped off our planet.
p7
aVAnd in those 50 years, not only did we literally, physically set foot on the moon,
p8
aVbut we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets \u2014 all eight of them \u2014
p9
aVand we have landed on asteroids, we have rendezvoused with comets,
p10
aVand, at this point in time, we have a spacecraft on its way to Pluto,
p11
aVthe body formerly known as a planet.
p12
aVAnd all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey:
p13
aVa voyage to understand something, to get a sense of our cosmic place,
p14
aVto understand something of our origins, and how Earth, our planet,
p15
aVand we, living on it, came to be.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd of all the places in the solar system that we might go to
p18
aVand search for answers to questions like this,
p19
aVthere's Saturn. And we have been to Saturn before \u2014
p20
aVwe visited Saturn in the early 1980s \u2014
p21
aVbut our investigations of Saturn have become far more in-depth in detail
p22
aVsince the Cassini spacecraft, traveling across interplanetary space
p23
aVfor seven years, glided into orbit around Saturn in the summer of 2004,
p24
aVand became at that point the farthest robotic outpost
p25
aVthat humanity had ever established around the Sun.
p26
aa(lp27
VNow, the Saturn system is a rich planetary system.
p28
aVIt offers mystery, scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare,
p29
aVand the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach.
p30
aVIn fact, just studying the rings alone, we stand to learn a lot
p31
aVabout the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies.
p32
aVAnd here's a beautiful picture of the Andromeda Nebula,
p33
aVwhich is our closest, largest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way.
p34
aVAnd then, here's a beautiful composite of the Whirlpool Galaxy,
p35
aVtaken by the Hubble Space Telescope.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo the journey back to Saturn is really part of and is also a metaphor
p38
aVfor a much larger human voyage
p39
aVto understand the interconnectedness of everything around us,
p40
aVand also how humans fit into that picture.
p41
aVAnd it pains me that I can't tell you all that we have learned with Cassini.
p42
aVI can't show you all the beautiful pictures that we've taken
p43
aVin the last two and a half years, because I simply don't have the time.
p44
aVSo I'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories
p45
aVthat have emerged out of this major exploratory expedition
p46
aVthat we are conducting around Saturn,
p47
aVand have been for the past two and a half years.
p48
aa(lp49
VSaturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons.
p50
aVThey range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the U.S.
p51
aVMost of the beautiful pictures we've taken of Saturn, in fact,
p52
aVshow Saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons. Here's Saturn with Dione,
p53
aVand then, here's Saturn showing the rings edge-on,
p54
aVshowing you just how vertically thin they are, with the moon Enceladus.
p55
aVNow, two of the 47 moons that Saturn has are standouts.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd those are Titan and Enceladus. Titan is Saturn's largest moon,
p58
aVand, until Cassini had arrived there,
p59
aVwas the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain
p60
aVthat we had remaining in our solar system.
p61
aVAnd it is a body that has long intrigued people who've watched the planets.
p62
aVIt has a very large, thick atmosphere,
p63
aVand in fact, its surface environment was believed to be
p64
aVmore like the environment we have here on the Earth,
p65
aVor at least had in the past, than any other body in the solar system.
p66
aVIts atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen, like you are breathing here in this room,
p67
aVexcept that its atmosphere is suffused with
p68
aVsimple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane.
p69
aVAnd these molecules high up in the atmosphere of Titan
p70
aVget broken down, and their products join together to make haze particles.
p71
aVThis haze is ubiquitous. It's completely global and enveloping Titan.
p72
aVAnd that's why you cannot see down to the surface
p73
aVwith our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum.
p74
aa(lp75
VBut these haze particles, it was surmised,
p76
aVbefore we got there with Cassini, over billions and billions of years,
p77
aVgently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface
p78
aVin a thick organic sludge.
p79
aVSo like the equivalent, the Titan equivalent, of tar, or oil, or what \u2014 we didn't know what.
p80
aVBut this is what we suspected. And these molecules,
p81
aVespecially methane and ethane, can be liquids at the surface temperatures of Titan.
p82
aVAnd so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth.
p83
aVIt's a condensable in the atmosphere,
p84
aVand so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore
p85
aVa whole world of bizarre possibilities. You can have methane clouds, OK,
p86
aVand above those clouds, you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze,
p87
aVwhich prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface.
p88
aVThe temperature at the surface is some 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
p89
aa(lp90
VBut despite that cold, you could have rain falling down on the surface of Titan.
p91
aVAnd doing on Titan what rain does on the Earth: it carves gullies; it forms rivers
p92
aVand cataracts; it can create canyons; it can pool in large basins and craters.
p93
aVIt can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills,
p94
aVdown into the lowlands. So stop and think for a minute.
p95
aVTry to imagine what the surface of Titan might look like.
p96
aVIt's dark. High noon on Titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the Earth.
p97
aVIt's cold, it's eerie, it's misty,
p98
aVit might be raining, and you might be standing
p99
aVon the shores of Lake Michigan brimming with paint thinner. (Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
VThat is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini,
p102
aVand I can tell you that what we have found on Titan, though it is not the same in detail,
p103
aVis every bit as fascinating as that story is.
p104
aVAnd for us, it has been like \u2014 the Cassini people \u2014
p105
aVit has been like a Jules Verne adventure come true.
p106
aVAs I said, it has a thick, extensive atmosphere.
p107
aVThis is a picture of Titan, backlit by the Sun, with the rings as a beautiful backdrop.
p108
aVAnd yet another moon there \u2014
p109
aVI don't even know which one it is. It's a very extensive atmosphere.
p110
aVWe have instruments on Cassini which can see down to the surface
p111
aVthrough this atmosphere, and my camera system is one of them.
p112
aVAnd we have taken pictures like this.
p113
aVAnd what you see is bright and dark regions, and that's about as far as it got for us.
p114
aVIt was so mystifying: we couldn't make out what we were seeing on Titan.
p115
aVWhen you look closer at this region, you start to see things
p116
aVlike sinuous channels \u2014 we didn't know. You see a few round things.
p117
aVThis, we later found out, is, in fact, a crater,
p118
aVbut there are very few craters on the surface of Titan,
p119
aVmeaning it's a very young surface.
p120
aVAnd there are features that look tectonic.
p121
aVThey look like they've been pulled apart.
p122
aVWhenever you see anything linear on a planet,
p123
aVit means there's been a fracture, like a fault.
p124
aVAnd so it's been tectonically altered.
p125
aa(lp126
VBut we couldn't make sense of our images,
p127
aVuntil, six months after we got into orbit,
p128
aVan event occurred that many have regarded
p129
aVas the highlight of Cassini's investigation of Titan.
p130
aVAnd that was the deployment of the Huygens probe,
p131
aVthe European-built Huygens probe that Cassini had carried
p132
aVfor seven years across the solar system. We deployed it to the atmosphere of Titan,
p133
aVit took two and a half hours to descend, and it landed on the surface.
p134
aVAnd I just want to emphasize how significant an event this is.
p135
aVThis is a device of human making,
p136
aVand it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history.
p137
aVIt is so significant that, in my mind,
p138
aVthis was an event that should have been celebrated
p139
aVwith ticker tape parades in every city across the U.S. and Europe,
p140
aVand sadly, that wasn't the case.
p141
aV(Laughter).
p142
aa(lp143
VIt was significant for another reason. This is an international mission,
p144
aVand this event was celebrated in Europe, in Germany,
p145
aVand the celebratory presentations were given in English accents,
p146
aVand American accents, and German accents, and French and Italian and Dutch accents.
p147
aVIt was a moving demonstration of what the words
p148
aV"united nations" are supposed to mean:
p149
aVa true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good.
p150
aVAnd, in this case, it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet,
p151
aVand to come to understand a planetary system
p152
aVthat, for all of human history, had been unreachable,
p153
aVand now humans had actually touched it.
p154
aVSo it was \u2014 I mean, I'm getting goose bumps just talking about it.
p155
aVIt was a tremendously emotional event,
p156
aVand it's something that I will personally never forget, and you shouldn't either.
p157
aV(Applause).
p158
aa(lp159
VBut anyway, the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down,
p160
aVand it also took panoramic pictures.
p161
aVAnd I can't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures
p162
aVof Titan's surface from the probe. And this is what we saw.
p163
aVAnd it was a shocker, because it was everything we wanted
p164
aVthose other pictures taken from orbit to be.
p165
aVIt was an unambiguous pattern, a geological pattern.
p166
aVIt's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids.
p167
aVAnd you can follow these channels
p168
aVand you can see how they all converge.
p169
aVAnd they converge into this channel here, which drains into this region.
p170
aVYou are looking at a shoreline.
p171
aVWas this a shoreline of fluids? We didn't know.
p172
aVBut this is somewhat of a shoreline.
p173
aa(lp174
VThis picture is taken at 16 kilometers.
p175
aVThis is the picture taken at eight kilometers, OK? Again, the shoreline.
p176
aVOkay, now, 16 kilometers, eight kilometers \u2014 this is roughly an airline altitude.
p177
aVIf you were going to take an airplane trip across the U.S.,
p178
aVyou would be flying at these altitudes.
p179
aVSo, this is the picture you would have at the window of Titanian Airlines
p180
aVas you fly across the surface of Titan. (Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd then finally, the probe came to rest on the surface,
p183
aVand I'm going to show you, ladies and gentlemen,
p184
aVthe first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system.
p185
aVAnd here is the horizon, OK?
p186
aVThese are probably water ice pebbles, yes?
p187
aV(Applause).
p188
aVAnd obviously, it landed in one of these flat, dark regions
p189
aVand it didn't sink out of sight. So it wasn't fluid that we landed in.
p190
aVWhat the probe came down in was basically
p191
aVthe Titan equivalent of a mud flat.
p192
aVThis is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane.
p193
aVAnd it's probably the case that this material
p194
aVhas washed off the highlands of Titan
p195
aVthrough these channels that we saw,
p196
aVand has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins.
p197
aVAnd that is what the Huygens probe landed in.
p198
aa(lp199
VBut still, there was no sign in our images,
p200
aVor even in the Huygens' images, of any large, open bodies of fluids.
p201
aVWhere were they? It got even more puzzling when we found dunes.
p202
aVOK, so this is our movie of the equatorial region of Titan,
p203
aVshowing these dunes. These are dunes that are 100 meters tall,
p204
aVseparated by a few kilometers,
p205
aVand they go on for miles and miles and miles.
p206
aVThere's hundreds, up to a 1,000 or 1,200 miles of dunes.
p207
aVThis is the Saharan desert of Titan.
p208
aVIt's obviously a place which is very dry, or you wouldn't get dunes.
p209
aa(lp210
VSo again, it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid,
p211
aVuntil finally, we saw lakes in the polar regions.
p212
aVAnd there is a lake scene in the south polar region of Titan.
p213
aVIt's about the size of Lake Ontario.
p214
aVAnd then, only a week and a half ago,
p215
aVwe flew over the north pole of Titan and found, again,
p216
aVwe found a feature here the size of the Caspian Sea.
p217
aVSo it seems that the liquids, for some reason we don't understand,
p218
aVor during at least this season, are apparently at the poles of Titan.
p219
aVAnd I think you would agree that we have found Titan
p220
aVis a remarkable, mystical place. It's exotic, it's alien, but yet strangely Earth-like,
p221
aVand having Earth-like geological formations
p222
aVand a tremendous geographical diversity,
p223
aVand is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system
p224
aVfor complexity and richness is the Earth itself.
p225
aa(lp226
VAnd so now we go onto Enceladus. Enceladus is a small moon,
p227
aVit's about a tenth the size of Titan. And you can see it here next to England,
p228
aVjust to show you the size. This is not meant to be a threat.
p229
aV(Laughter).
p230
aVAnd Enceladus is very white, it's very bright,
p231
aVand its surface is obviously wrecked with fractures.
p232
aVIt is a very geologically active body.
p233
aVBut the mother lode of discoveries on Enceladus
p234
aVwas found at the south pole \u2014 and we're looking at the south pole here \u2014
p235
aVwhere we found this system of fractures.
p236
aVAnd they're a different color because they're a different composition.
p237
aVThey are coated. These fractures are coated with organic materials.
p238
aVMoreover, this whole, entire region, the south polar region,
p239
aVhas elevated temperatures. It's the hottest place on the planet, on the body.
p240
aVThat's as bizarre as finding that the Antarctic on the Earth is hotter than the tropics.
p241
aa(lp242
VAnd then, when we took additional pictures, we discovered
p243
aVthat from these fractures are issuing jets of fine, icy particles
p244
aVextending hundreds of miles into space.
p245
aVAnd when we color-code this image, to bring out the faint light levels,
p246
aVwe see that these jets feed a plume
p247
aVthat, in fact, we see, in other images, goes thousands of miles
p248
aVinto the space above Enceladus.
p249
aVMy team and I have examined images like this,
p250
aVand like this one, and have thought about the other results from Cassini.
p251
aVAnd we have arrived at the conclusion
p252
aVthat these jets may be erupting from pockets
p253
aVof liquid water under the surface of Enceladus.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo we have, possibly, liquid water, organic materials and excess heat.
p256
aVIn other words, we have possibly stumbled upon
p257
aVthe holy grail of modern day planetary exploration,
p258
aVor in other words, an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms.
p259
aVAnd I don't think I need to tell you that the discovery of life
p260
aVelsewhere in our solar system,
p261
aVwhether it be on Enceladus or elsewhere,
p262
aVwould have enormous cultural and scientific implications.
p263
aVBecause if we could demonstrate that genesis had occurred
p264
aVnot once, but twice, independently, in our solar system,
p265
aVthen that means, by inference, it has occurred a staggering number of times
p266
aVthroughout the universe and its 13.7 billion year history.
p267
aa(lp268
VRight now, Earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life.
p269
aVIt is precious, it is unique,
p270
aVit is still, so far, the only home we've ever known.
p271
aVAnd if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s \u2014
p272
aVand we'd forgive you, if you weren't, OK \u2014
p273
aVyou would remember this very famous picture
p274
aVtaken by the Apollo 8 astronauts in 1968.
p275
aVIt was the first time that Earth was imaged from space,
p276
aVand it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe,
p277
aVand our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet.
p278
aa(lp279
VWell, we on Cassini have taken an equivalent first,
p280
aVa picture that no human eye has ever seen before.
p281
aVIt is a total eclipse of the Sun, seen from the other side of Saturn.
p282
aVAnd in this impossibly beautiful picture,
p283
aVyou see the main rings backlit by the Sun,
p284
aVyou see the refracted image of the Sun
p285
aVand you see this ring created, in fact,
p286
aVby the exhalations of Enceladus.
p287
aVBut as if that weren't brilliant enough, we can spot, in this beautiful image,
p288
aVsight of our own planet,
p289
aVcradled in the arms of Saturn's rings.
p290
aa(lp291
VNow, there is something deeply moving
p292
aVabout seeing ourselves from afar,
p293
aVand capturing the sight of our little, blue-ocean planet
p294
aVin the skies of other worlds.
p295
aVAnd that, and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that,
p296
aVmay be, in the end, the finest reward that we earn
p297
aVfrom this journey of discovery that started half a century ago.
p298
aVAnd thank you very much.
p299
aV(Applause)

Her work on the planet&#39;s rings and their relation to its moons cemented her connection with Saturn.

"middleinitial": "", "whylisten": "<p class=\\"p1\\">Planetary scientist Carolyn Porco studies and interprets the photos from NASA space missions like the renowned <em>Voyager</em> mission to the outer solar system in the 1980s and the <em>Cassini-Huygens</em> mission to Saturn. She leads a team of scientists from the US and Europe that has been analyzing the <a href=\\"http://ciclops.org/ir_index_main.php%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank\\"><span class=\\"s1\\">images</span></a> <em>Cassini</em> has sent back since it left Earth in 1997. At Saturn, they have found new phenomena everywhere they&#39;ve turned their cameras &hellip; in the planet&rsquo;s atmosphere, within its rings and on the surfaces of its many moons. And they&#39;ve produced spectacular <strong>images and animations of these marvels in the process.</strong></p><p class=\\"p1\\">Back in the early-1980s, while still working on her doctorate, Porco was drafted onto the <em>Voyager</em> imaging team to assist in crunching the mountains of data coming back from <em>Voyager&rsquo;s</em> fly-by of Saturn. Her work on the planet&#39;s rings and their relation to its moons cemented her connection with Saturn. After <em>Voyager</em> had flown by Neptune and<em> </em>was nearing conclusion, she worked together with Carl Sagan in planning <em>Voyager&rsquo;s&nbsp;</em>celebrated <em>Pale Blue Dot</em> picture of Earth.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">Her ongoing work at the <a href=\\"http://ciclops.org/index.php%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank\\"><span class=\\"s1\\">Cassini Imaging Central Laboratory for Operations (CICLOPs)</span></a> has two goals: to process, interpret and archive&nbsp;<em>Cassini&rsquo;s</em> images for other scientists, and to make sure the images -- in all <strong>their breathtaking poetry and mystery and sheer Save-Image-As-Desktop awesomeness</strong> -- connect with the general public. She is an advocate for the exploration and understanding of planetary space, and her frequent talks (as well as her <a href=\\"http://ciclops.org/index.php%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank\\"><span class=\\"s1\\">&quot;Captain&#39;s Log&quot; memos</span></a> on the CICLOPS website) speak to everyone, scientist and nonscientist alike. Her advocacy extends to Hollywood, where she was the character consultant on the 1997 movie &ldquo;<em>Contact</em>,&rdquo; and a consultant on the 2009 Paramount Pictures re-boot of &ldquo;<em>Star Trek</em>.&rdquo; In 2012, she was named one the 25 most influential people in space by <em>TIME</em> magazine.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">Finally, in a twist on the Pale Blue Dot theme, it was she who conceived the idea to invite the people of the world to smile while <em>Cassini&nbsp;</em>imaged the Earth on July 19, 2013 in an event called &ldquo;The Day the Earth Smiled.&rdquo;</p><p

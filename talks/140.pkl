VI told you three things last year.
p5
aVI told you that the statistics of the world
p6
aVhave not been made properly available.
p7
aVBecause of that, we still have the old mindset
p8
aVof developing in industrialized countries, which is wrong.
p9
aVAnd that animated graphics can make a difference.
p10
aVThings are changing
p11
aVand today, on the United Nations Statistic Division Home Page,
p12
aVit says, by first of May, full access to the databases.
p13
aV(Applause)
p14
aVAnd if I could share the image with you on the screen.
p15
aVSo three things have happened.
p16
aVU.N. opened their statistic databases,
p17
aVand we have a new version of the software
p18
aVup working as a beta on the net,
p19
aVso you don't have to download it any longer.
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd let me repeat what you saw last year.
p22
aVThe bubbles are the countries.
p23
aVHere you have the fertility rate \u2014 the number of children per woman \u2014
p24
aVand there you have the length of life in years.
p25
aVThis is 1950 \u2014 those were the industrialized countries,
p26
aVthose were developing countries.
p27
aVAt that time there was a "we" and "them."
p28
aVThere was a huge difference in the world.
p29
aVBut then it changed, and it went on quite well.
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd this is what happens.
p32
aVYou can see how China is the red, big bubble.
p33
aVThe blue there is India.
p34
aVAnd they go over all this \u2014 I'm going to try to be
p35
aVa little more serious this year in showing you
p36
aVhow things really changed.
p37
aVAnd it's Africa that stands out as the problem down here, doesn't it?
p38
aVLarge families still, and the HIV epidemic
p39
aVbrought down the countries like this.
p40
aVThis is more or less what we saw last year,
p41
aVand this is how it will go on into the future.
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd I will talk on, is this possible?
p44
aVBecause you see now, I presented statistics that don't exist.
p45
aVBecause this is where we are.
p46
aVWill it be possible that this will happen?
p47
aVI cover my lifetime here, you know?
p48
aVI expect to live 100 years.
p49
aVAnd this is where we are today.
p50
aVNow could we look here instead at the economic situation in the world?
p51
aVAnd I would like to show that against child survival.
p52
aVWe'll swap the axis.
p53
aVHere you have child mortality \u2014 that is, survival \u2014
p54
aVfour kids dying there, 200 dying there.
p55
aVAnd this is GDP per capita on this axis.
p56
aVAnd this was 2007.
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd if I go back in time, I've added some historical statistics \u2014
p59
aVhere we go, here we go, here we go \u2014 not so much statistics 100 years ago.
p60
aVSome countries still had statistics.
p61
aVWe are looking down in the archive,
p62
aVand when we are down into 1820,
p63
aVthere is only Austria and Sweden that can produce numbers.
p64
aV(Laughter)
p65
aVBut they were down here. They had 1,000 dollars per person per year.
p66
aVAnd they lost one-fifth of their kids before their first birthday.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo this is what happens in the world, if we play the entire world.
p69
aVHow they got slowly richer and richer,
p70
aVand they add statistics.
p71
aVIsn't it beautiful when they get statistics?
p72
aVYou see the importance of that?
p73
aVAnd here, children don't live longer.
p74
aVThe last century, 1870, was bad for the kids in Europe,
p75
aVbecause most of this statistics is Europe.
p76
aVIt was only by the turn of the century
p77
aVthat more than 90 percent of the children survived their first year.
p78
aVThis is India coming up, with the first data from India.
p79
aVAnd this is the United States moving away here, earning more money.
p80
aVAnd we will soon see China coming up in the very far end corner here.
p81
aVAnd it moves up with Mao Tse-Tung getting health,
p82
aVnot getting so rich.
p83
aVThere he died, then Deng Xiaoping brings money.
p84
aVIt moves this way over here.
p85
aVAnd the bubbles keep moving up there,
p86
aVand this is what the world looks like today.
p87
aV(Applause)
p88
aa(lp89
VLet us have a look at the United States.
p90
aVWe have a function here \u2014 I can tell the world, "Stay where you are."
p91
aVAnd I take the United States \u2014 we still want to see the background \u2014
p92
aVI put them up like this, and now we go backwards.
p93
aVAnd we can see that the United States
p94
aVgoes to the right of the mainstream.
p95
aVThey are on the money side all the time.
p96
aVAnd down in 1915, the United States was a neighbor of India \u2014
p97
aVpresent, contemporary India.
p98
aVAnd that means United States was richer,
p99
aVbut lost more kids than India is doing today, proportionally.
p100
aVAnd look here \u2014 compare to the Philippines of today.
p101
aVThe Philippines of today has almost the same economy
p102
aVas the United States during the First World War.
p103
aVBut we have to bring United States forward quite a while
p104
aVto find the same health of the United States
p105
aVas we have in the Philippines.
p106
aVAbout 1957 here, the health of the United States
p107
aVis the same as the Philippines.
p108
aVAnd this is the drama of this world which many call globalized,
p109
aVis that Asia, Arabic countries, Latin America,
p110
aVare much more ahead in being healthy, educated,
p111
aVhaving human resources than they are economically.
p112
aa(lp113
VThere's a discrepancy in what's happening today
p114
aVin the emerging economies.
p115
aVThere now, social benefits, social progress,
p116
aVare going ahead of economical progress.
p117
aVAnd 1957 \u2014 the United States had the same economy as Chile has today.
p118
aVAnd how long do we have to bring United States
p119
aVto get the same health as Chile has today?
p120
aVI think we have to go, there \u2014 we have 2001, or 2002 \u2014
p121
aVthe United States has the same health as Chile.
p122
aVChile's catching up!
p123
aVWithin some years Chile may have better child survival
p124
aVthan the United States.
p125
aVThis is really a change, that you have this lag
p126
aVof more or less 30, 40 years' difference on the health.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd behind the health is the educational level.
p129
aVAnd there's a lot of infrastructure things,
p130
aVand general human resources are there.
p131
aVNow we can take away this \u2014
p132
aVand I would like to show you the rate of speed,
p133
aVthe rate of change, how fast they have gone.
p134
aVAnd we go back to 1920, and I want to look at Japan.
p135
aVAnd I want to look at Sweden and the United States.
p136
aVAnd I'm going to stage a race here
p137
aVbetween this sort of yellowish Ford here
p138
aVand the red Toyota down there,
p139
aVand the brownish Volvo.
p140
aV(Laughter)
p141
aVAnd here we go. Here we go.
p142
aVThe Toyota has a very bad start down here, you can see,
p143
aVand the United States Ford is going off-road there.
p144
aVAnd the Volvo is doing quite fine.
p145
aVThis is the war. The Toyota got off track, and now
p146
aVthe Toyota is coming on the healthier side of Sweden \u2014
p147
aVcan you see that?
p148
aVAnd they are taking over Sweden,
p149
aVand they are now healthier than Sweden.
p150
aVThat's the part where I sold the Volvo and bought the Toyota.
p151
aV(Laughter)
p152
aVAnd now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in Japan.
p153
aVThey really caught up.
p154
aa(lp155
VAnd this changes gradually.
p156
aVWe have to look over generations to understand it.
p157
aVAnd let me show you my own sort of family history \u2014
p158
aVwe made these graphs here.
p159
aVAnd this is the same thing, money down there, and health, you know?
p160
aVAnd this is my family.
p161
aVThis is Sweden, 1830, when my great-great-grandma was born.
p162
aVSweden was like Sierra Leone today.
p163
aVAnd this is when great-grandma was born, 1863.
p164
aVAnd Sweden was like Mozambique.
p165
aVAnd this is when my grandma was born, 1891.
p166
aVShe took care of me as a child,
p167
aVso I'm not talking about statistic now \u2014
p168
aVnow it's oral history in my family.
p169
aVThat's when I believe statistics,
p170
aVwhen it's grandma-verified statistics.
p171
aV(Laughter)
p172
aVI think it's the best way of verifying historical statistics.
p173
aVSweden was like Ghana.
p174
aVIt's interesting to see the enormous diversity
p175
aVwithin sub-Saharan Africa.
p176
aVI told you last year, I'll tell you again,
p177
aVmy mother was born in Egypt, and I \u2014 who am I?
p178
aVI'm the Mexican in the family.
p179
aVAnd my daughter, she was born in Chile,
p180
aVand the grand-daughter was born in Singapore,
p181
aVnow the healthiest country on this Earth.
p182
aVIt bypassed Sweden about two to three years ago,
p183
aVwith better child survival.
p184
aVBut they're very small, you know?
p185
aVThey're so close to the hospital we can never
p186
aVbeat them out in these forests.
p187
aV(Laughter)
p188
aVBut homage to Singapore.
p189
aa(lp190
VSingapore is the best one.
p191
aVNow this looks also like a very good story.
p192
aVBut it's not really that easy, that it's all a good story.
p193
aVBecause I have to show you one of the other facilities.
p194
aVWe can also make the color here represent the variable \u2014
p195
aVand what am I choosing here?
p196
aVCarbon-dioxide emission, metric ton per capita.
p197
aVThis is 1962, and United States was emitting 16 tons per person.
p198
aVAnd China was emitting 0.6,
p199
aVand India was emitting 0.32 tons per capita.
p200
aVAnd what happens when we moved on?
p201
aVWell, you see the nice story of getting richer
p202
aVand getting healthier \u2014
p203
aVeveryone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide.
p204
aVThere is no one who has done it so far.
p205
aVAnd we don't have all the updated data
p206
aVany longer, because this is really hot data today.
p207
aVAnd there we are, 2001.
p208
aa(lp209
VAnd in the discussion I attended with global leaders, you know,
p210
aVmany say now the problem is that the emerging economies,
p211
aVthey are getting out too much carbon dioxide.
p212
aVThe Minister of the Environment of India said,
p213
aV"Well, you were the one who caused the problem."
p214
aVThe OECD countries \u2014 the high-income countries \u2014
p215
aVthey were the ones who caused the climate change.
p216
aV"But we forgive you, because you didn't know it.
p217
aVBut from now on, we count per capita.
p218
aVFrom now on we count per capita.
p219
aVAnd everyone is responsible for the per capita emission."
p220
aa(lp221
VThis really shows you, we have not seen good economic
p222
aVand health progress anywhere in the world
p223
aVwithout destroying the climate.
p224
aVAnd this is really what has to be changed.
p225
aVI've been criticized for showing you a too positive image of the world,
p226
aVbut I don't think it's like this.
p227
aVThe world is quite a messy place.
p228
aVThis we can call Dollar Street.
p229
aVEveryone lives on this street here.
p230
aVWhat they earn here \u2014 what number they live on \u2014
p231
aVis how much they earn per day.
p232
aVThis family earns about one dollar per day.
p233
aVWe drive up the street here,
p234
aVwe find a family here which earns about two to three dollars a day.
p235
aVAnd we drive away here \u2014 we find the first garden in the street,
p236
aVand they earn 10 to 50 dollars a day.
p237
aa(lp238
VAnd how do they live?
p239
aVIf we look at the bed here, we can see
p240
aVthat they sleep on a rug on the floor.
p241
aVThis is what poverty line is \u2014
p242
aV80 percent of the family income is just to cover the energy needs,
p243
aVthe food for the day.
p244
aVThis is two to five dollars. You have a bed.
p245
aVAnd here it's a much nicer bedroom, you can see.
p246
aVI lectured on this for Ikea, and they wanted to see
p247
aVthe sofa immediately here.
p248
aV(Laughter)
p249
aVAnd this is the sofa, how it will emerge from there.
p250
aVAnd the interesting thing, when you go around here in the photo panorama,
p251
aVyou see the family still sitting on the floor there.
p252
aVAlthough there is a sofa,
p253
aVif you watch in the kitchen, you can see that
p254
aVthe great difference for women does not come between one to 10 dollars.
p255
aVIt comes beyond here, when you really can get
p256
aVgood working conditions in the family.
p257
aVAnd if you really want to see the difference,
p258
aVyou look at the toilet over here.
p259
aVThis can change. This can change.
p260
aVThese are all pictures and images from Africa,
p261
aVand it can become much better.
p262
aVWe can get out of poverty.
p263
aa(lp264
VMy own research has not been in IT or anything like this.
p265
aVI spent 20 years in interviews with African farmers
p266
aVwho were on the verge of famine.
p267
aVAnd this is the result of the farmers-needs research.
p268
aVThe nice thing here is that you can't see
p269
aVwho are the researchers in this picture.
p270
aVThat's when research functions in poor societies \u2014
p271
aVyou must really live with the people.
p272
aa(lp273
VWhen you're in poverty, everything is about survival.
p274
aVIt's about having food.
p275
aVAnd these two young farmers, they are girls now \u2014
p276
aVbecause the parents are dead from HIV and AIDS \u2014
p277
aVthey discuss with a trained agronomist.
p278
aVThis is one of the best agronomists in Malawi, Junatambe Kumbira,
p279
aVand he's discussing what sort of cassava they will plant \u2014
p280
aVthe best converter of sunshine to food that man has found.
p281
aVAnd they are very, very eagerly interested to get advice,
p282
aVand that's to survive in poverty.
p283
aVThat's one context.
p284
aVGetting out of poverty.
p285
aVThe women told us one thing. "Get us technology.
p286
aVWe hate this mortar, to stand hours and hours.
p287
aVGet us a mill so that we can mill our flour,
p288
aVthen we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves."
p289
aVTechnology will bring you out of poverty,
p290
aVbut there's a need for a market to get away from poverty.
p291
aVAnd this woman is very happy now, bringing her products to the market.
p292
aVBut she's very thankful for the public investment in schooling
p293
aVso she can count, and won't be cheated when she reaches the market.
p294
aVShe wants her kid to be healthy, so she can go to the market
p295
aVand doesn't have to stay home.
p296
aVAnd she wants the infrastructure \u2014 it is nice with a paved road.
p297
aVIt's also good with credit.
p298
aVMicro-credits gave her the bicycle, you know.
p299
aVAnd information will tell her when to go to market with which product.
p300
aVYou can do this.
p301
aa(lp302
VI find my experience from 20 years of Africa is that
p303
aVthe seemingly impossible is possible.
p304
aVAfrica has not done bad.
p305
aVIn 50 years they've gone from a pre-Medieval situation
p306
aVto a very decent 100-year-ago Europe,
p307
aVwith a functioning nation and state.
p308
aVI would say that sub-Saharan Africa has done best in the world
p309
aVduring the last 50 years.
p310
aVBecause we don't consider where they came from.
p311
aVIt's this stupid concept of developing countries
p312
aVthat puts us, Argentina and Mozambique together 50 years ago,
p313
aVand says that Mozambique did worse.
p314
aVWe have to know a little more about the world.
p315
aVI have a neighbor who knows 200 types of wine.
p316
aVHe knows everything.
p317
aVHe knows the name of the grape, the temperature and everything.
p318
aVI only know two types of wine \u2014 red and white.
p319
aV(Laughter)
p320
aVBut my neighbor only knows two types of countries \u2014
p321
aVindustrialized and developing.
p322
aVAnd I know 200, I know about the small data.
p323
aVBut you can do that.
p324
aV(Applause)
p325
aa(lp326
VBut I have to get serious. And how do you get serious?
p327
aVYou make a PowerPoint, you know?
p328
aV(Laughter)
p329
aVHomage to the Office package, no?
p330
aVWhat is this, what is this, what am I telling?
p331
aVI'm telling you that there are many dimensions of development.
p332
aVEveryone wants your pet thing.
p333
aVIf you are in the corporate sector, you love micro-credit.
p334
aVIf you are fighting in a non-governmental organization,
p335
aVyou love equity between gender.
p336
aVOr if you are a teacher, you'll love UNESCO, and so on.
p337
aVOn the global level, we have to have more than our own thing.
p338
aVWe need everything.
p339
aVAll these things are important for development,
p340
aVespecially when you just get out of poverty
p341
aVand you should go towards welfare.
p342
aa(lp343
VNow, what we need to think about
p344
aVis, what is a goal for development,
p345
aVand what are the means for development?
p346
aVLet me first grade what are the most important means.
p347
aVEconomic growth to me, as a public-health professor,
p348
aVis the most important thing for development
p349
aVbecause it explains 80 percent of survival.
p350
aVGovernance. To have a government which functions \u2014
p351
aVthat's what brought California out of the misery of 1850.
p352
aVIt was the government that made law function finally.
p353
aVEducation, human resources are important.
p354
aVHealth is also important, but not that much as a mean.
p355
aVEnvironment is important.
p356
aVHuman rights is also important, but it just gets one cross.
p357
aa(lp358
VNow what about goals? Where are we going toward?
p359
aVWe are not interested in money.
p360
aVMoney is not a goal.
p361
aVIt's the best mean, but I give it zero as a goal.
p362
aVGovernance, well it's fun to vote in a little thing,
p363
aVbut it's not a goal.
p364
aVAnd going to school, that's not a goal, it's a mean.
p365
aVHealth I give two points. I mean it's nice to be healthy
p366
aV\u2014 at my age especially \u2014 you can stand here, you're healthy.
p367
aVAnd that's good, it gets two plusses.
p368
aVEnvironment is very, very crucial.
p369
aVThere's nothing for the grandkid if you don't save up.
p370
aVBut where are the important goals?
p371
aVOf course, it's human rights.
p372
aVHuman rights is the goal,
p373
aVbut it's not that strong of a mean for achieving development.
p374
aVAnd culture. Culture is the most important thing, I would say,
p375
aVbecause that's what brings joy to life.
p376
aVThat's the value of living.
p377
aa(lp378
VSo the seemingly impossible is possible.
p379
aVEven African countries can achieve this.
p380
aVAnd I've shown you the shot where the seemingly impossible is possible.
p381
aVAnd remember, please remember my main message,
p382
aVwhich is this: the seemingly impossible is possible.
p383
aVWe can have a good world.
p384
aVI showed you the shots, I proved it in the PowerPoint,
p385
aVand I think I will convince you also by culture.
p386
aV(Laughter)
p387
aV(Applause)
p388
aVBring me my sword!
p389
aVSword swallowing is from ancient India.
p390
aVIt's a cultural expression that for thousands of years
p391
aVhas inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious.
p392
aV(Laughter)
p393
aVAnd I will now prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible
p394
aVby taking this piece of steel \u2014 solid steel \u2014
p395
aVthis is the army bayonet from the Swedish Army, 1850,
p396
aVin the last year we had war.
p397
aVAnd it's all solid steel \u2014 you can hear here.
p398
aVAnd I'm going to take this blade of steel,
p399
aVand push it down through my body of blood and flesh,
p400
aVand prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible.
p401
aVCan I request a moment of absolute silence?
p402
aV(Applause)

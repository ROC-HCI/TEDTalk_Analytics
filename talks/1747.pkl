VSo, when I was in art school,
p5
aVI developed a shake in my hand,
p6
aVand this was the straightest line I could draw.
p7
aVNow in hindsight, it was actually good for some things,
p8
aVlike mixing a can of paint or shaking a Polaroid,
p9
aVbut at the time this was really doomsday.
p10
aVThis was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist.
p11
aa(lp12
VThe shake developed out of, really,
p13
aVa single-minded pursuit of pointillism,
p14
aVjust years of making tiny, tiny dots.
p15
aVAnd eventually these dots went from being perfectly round
p16
aVto looking more like tadpoles, because of the shake.
p17
aVSo to compensate, I'd hold the pen tighter,
p18
aVand this progressively made the shake worse,
p19
aVso I'd hold the pen tighter still.
p20
aVAnd this became a vicious cycle that ended up
p21
aVcausing so much pain and joint issues,
p22
aVI had trouble holding anything.
p23
aVAnd after spending all my life wanting to do art,
p24
aVI left art school, and then I left art completely.
p25
aa(lp26
VBut after a few years, I just couldn't stay away from art,
p27
aVand I decided to go to a neurologist about the shake
p28
aVand discovered I had permanent nerve damage.
p29
aVAnd he actually took one look at my squiggly line,
p30
aVand said, "Well, why don't you just embrace the shake?"
p31
aa(lp32
VSo I did. I went home, I grabbed a pencil,
p33
aVand I just started letting my hand shake and shake.
p34
aVI was making all these scribble pictures.
p35
aVAnd even though it wasn't the kind of art
p36
aVthat I was ultimately passionate about, it felt great.
p37
aVAnd more importantly, once I embraced the shake,
p38
aVI realized I could still make art.
p39
aVI just had to find a different approach
p40
aVto making the art that I wanted.
p41
aa(lp42
VNow, I still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism,
p43
aVseeing these little tiny dots come together
p44
aVto make this unified whole.
p45
aVSo I began experimenting with other ways to fragment images
p46
aVwhere the shake wouldn't affect the work,
p47
aVlike dipping my feet in paint and walking on a canvas,
p48
aVor, in a 3D structure consisting of two-by-fours,
p49
aVcreating a 2D image by burning it with a blowtorch.
p50
aVI discovered that, if I worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials,
p51
aVmy hand really wouldn't hurt,
p52
aVand after having gone from a single approach to art,
p53
aVI ended up having an approach to creativity
p54
aVthat completely changed my artistic horizons.
p55
aVThis was the first time I'd encountered this idea
p56
aVthat embracing a limitation could actually drive creativity.
p57
aa(lp58
VAt the time, I was finishing up school,
p59
aVand I was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies.
p60
aVI had this horrible little set of tools, and I felt like
p61
aVI could do so much more with the supplies
p62
aVI thought an artist was supposed to have.
p63
aVI actually didn't even have a regular pair of scissors.
p64
aVI was using these metal shears until I stole a pair
p65
aVfrom the office that I worked at.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo I got out of school, I got a job, I got a paycheck,
p68
aVI got myself to the art store,
p69
aVand I just went nuts buying supplies.
p70
aVAnd then when I got home, I sat down
p71
aVand I set myself to task to really try to create something
p72
aVjust completely outside of the box.
p73
aVBut I sat there for hours, and nothing came to mind.
p74
aVThe same thing the next day, and then the next,
p75
aVquickly slipping into a creative slump.
p76
aVAnd I was in a dark place for a long time, unable to create.
p77
aVAnd it didn't make any sense, because I was finally able
p78
aVto support my art, and yet I was creatively blank.
p79
aa(lp80
VBut as I searched around in the darkness,
p81
aVI realized I was actually paralyzed by all of the choices
p82
aVthat I never had before.
p83
aVAnd it was then that I thought back to my jittery hands.
p84
aVEmbrace the shake.
p85
aVAnd I realized, if I ever wanted my creativity back,
p86
aVI had to quit trying so hard to think outside of the box
p87
aVand get back into it.
p88
aa(lp89
VI wondered, could you become more creative, then,
p90
aVby looking for limitations?
p91
aVWhat if I could only create with a dollar's worth of supplies?
p92
aVAt this point, I was spending a lot of my evenings in \u2014
p93
aVwell, I guess I still spend a lot of my evenings in Starbucks \u2014
p94
aVbut I know you can ask for an extra cup if you want one,
p95
aVso I decided to ask for 50.
p96
aVSurprisingly, they just handed them right over,
p97
aVand then with some pencils I already had,
p98
aVI made this project for only 80 cents.
p99
aVIt really became a moment of clarification for me
p100
aVthat we need to first be limited
p101
aVin order to become limitless.
p102
aa(lp103
VI took this approach of thinking inside the box
p104
aVto my canvas, and wondered what if, instead of
p105
aVpainting on a canvas, I could only paint on my chest?
p106
aVSo I painted 30 images, one layer at a time,
p107
aVone on top of another,
p108
aVwith each picture representing an influence in my life.
p109
aVOr what if, instead of painting with a brush,
p110
aVI could only paint with karate chops? (Laughter)
p111
aVSo I'd dip my hands in paint,
p112
aVand I just attacked the canvas,
p113
aVand I actually hit so hard that I bruised a joint in my pinkie
p114
aVand it was stuck straight for a couple of weeks.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p117
aa(lp118
VOr, what if instead of relying on myself,
p119
aVI had to rely on other people
p120
aVto create the content for the art?
p121
aVSo for six days, I lived in front of a webcam.
p122
aVI slept on the floor and I ate takeout,
p123
aVand I asked people to call me and share a story with me
p124
aVabout a life-changing moment.
p125
aVTheir stories became the art
p126
aVas I wrote them onto the revolving canvas.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Applause)
p129
aVOr what if instead of making art to display,
p130
aVI had to destroy it?
p131
aVThis seemed like the ultimate limitation,
p132
aVbeing an artist without art.
p133
aVThis destruction idea turned into a yearlong project
p134
aVthat I called Goodbye Art,
p135
aVwhere each and every piece of art had to be destroyed after its creation.
p136
aVIn the beginning of Goodbye Art, I focused on
p137
aVforced destruction, like this image of Jimi Hendrix,
p138
aVmade with over 7,000 matches.
p139
aV(Laughter)
p140
aVThen I opened it up to creating art that was destroyed naturally.
p141
aVI looked for temporary materials,
p142
aVlike spitting out food \u2014
p143
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p144
aVsidewalk chalk
p145
aVand even frozen wine.
p146
aa(lp147
VThe last iteration of destruction
p148
aVwas to try to produce something that didn't actually exist in the first place.
p149
aVSo I organized candles on a table, I lit them, and then blew them out,
p150
aVthen repeated this process over and over with the same set of candles,
p151
aVthen assembled the videos into the larger image.
p152
aVSo the end image was never visible as a physical whole.
p153
aVIt was destroyed before it ever existed.
p154
aa(lp155
VIn the course of this Goodbye Art series,
p156
aVI created 23 different pieces
p157
aVwith nothing left to physically display.
p158
aVWhat I thought would be the ultimate limitation
p159
aVactually turned out to be the ultimate liberation,
p160
aVas each time I created,
p161
aVthe destruction brought me back to a neutral place
p162
aVwhere I felt refreshed and ready to start the next project.
p163
aVIt did not happen overnight.
p164
aVThere were times when my projects failed to get off the ground,
p165
aVor, even worse, after spending tons of time on them
p166
aVthe end image was kind of embarrassing.
p167
aVBut having committed to the process, I continued on,
p168
aa(lp169
Vand something really surprising came out of this.
p170
aVAs I destroyed each project,
p171
aVI was learning to let go,
p172
aVlet go of outcomes, let go of failures,
p173
aVand let go of imperfections.
p174
aVAnd in return, I found a process of creating art
p175
aVthat's perpetual and unencumbered by results.
p176
aVI found myself in a state of constant creation,
p177
aVthinking only of what's next
p178
aVand coming up with more ideas than ever.
p179
aa(lp180
VWhen I think back to my three years away from art,
p181
aVaway from my dream, just going through the motions,
p182
aVinstead of trying to find a different way to continue that dream,
p183
aVI just quit, I gave up.
p184
aVAnd what if I didn't embrace the shake?
p185
aVBecause embracing the shake for me
p186
aVwasn't just about art and having art skills.
p187
aVIt turned out to be about life, and having life skills.
p188
aVBecause ultimately, most of what we do
p189
aVtakes place here, inside the box, with limited resources.
p190
aVLearning to be creative within the confines of our limitations
p191
aVis the best hope we have to transform ourselves
p192
aVand, collectively, transform our world.
p193
aa(lp194
VLooking at limitations as a source of creativity
p195
aVchanged the course of my life.
p196
aVNow, when I run into a barrier
p197
aVor I find myself creatively stumped,
p198
aVI sometimes still struggle,
p199
aVbut I continue to show up for the process
p200
aVand try to remind myself of the possibilities,
p201
aVlike using hundreds of real, live worms to make an image,
p202
aVusing a pushpin to tattoo a banana,
p203
aVor painting a picture with hamburger grease.
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VOne of my most recent endeavors
p208
aVis to try to translate the habits of creativity that I've learned
p209
aVinto something others can replicate.
p210
aa(lp211
VLimitations may be the most unlikely of places
p212
aVto harness creativity, but perhaps
p213
aVone of the best ways to get ourselves out of ruts,
p214
aVrethink categories and challenge accepted norms.
p215
aVAnd instead of telling each other to seize the day,
p216
aVmaybe we can remind ourselves every day
p217
aVto seize the limitation.
p218
aa(lp219
VThank you.

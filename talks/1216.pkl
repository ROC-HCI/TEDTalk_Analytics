VI want to address the issue of compassion.
p5
aVCompassion has many faces.
p6
aVSome of them are fierce; some of them are wrathful;
p7
aVsome of them are tender; some of them are wise.
p8
aVA line that the Dalai Lama once said,
p9
aVhe said, "Love and compassion are necessities.
p10
aVThey are not luxuries.
p11
aVWithout them,
p12
aVhumanity cannot survive."
p13
aVAnd I would suggest,
p14
aVit is not only humanity that won't survive,
p15
aVbut it is all species on the planet,
p16
aVas we've heard today.
p17
aVIt is the big cats,
p18
aVand it's the plankton.
p19
aa(lp20
VTwo weeks ago, I was in Bangalore in India.
p21
aVI was so privileged
p22
aVto be able to teach in a hospice
p23
aVon the outskirts of Bangalore.
p24
aVAnd early in the morning,
p25
aVI went into the ward.
p26
aVIn that hospice,
p27
aVthere were 31 men and women
p28
aVwho were actively dying.
p29
aVAnd I walked up to the bedside
p30
aVof an old woman
p31
aVwho was breathing very rapidly, fragile,
p32
aVobviously in the latter phase
p33
aVof active dying.
p34
aVI looked into her face.
p35
aVI looked into the face
p36
aVof her son sitting next to her,
p37
aVand his face was just riven
p38
aVwith grief and confusion.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd I remembered
p41
aVa line from the Mahabharata,
p42
aVthe great Indian epic:
p43
aV"What is the most wondrous thing in the world, Yudhisthira?"
p44
aVAnd Yudhisthira replied,
p45
aV"The most wondrous thing in the world
p46
aVis that all around us
p47
aVpeople can be dying
p48
aVand we don't realize
p49
aVit can happen to us."
p50
aVI looked up.
p51
aVTending those 31 dying people
p52
aVwere young women
p53
aVfrom villages around Bangalore.
p54
aVI looked into the face of one of these women,
p55
aVand I saw in her face
p56
aVthe strength that arises
p57
aVwhen natural compassion is really present.
p58
aVI watched her hands
p59
aVas she bathed an old man.
p60
aa(lp61
VMy gaze went to another young woman
p62
aVas she wiped the face
p63
aVof another dying person.
p64
aVAnd it reminded me
p65
aVof something that I had just been present for.
p66
aVEvery year or so,
p67
aVI have the privilege of taking clinicians
p68
aVinto the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau.
p69
aVAnd we run clinics
p70
aVin these very remote regions
p71
aVwhere there's no medical care whatsoever.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd on the first day at Simikot in Humla,
p74
aVfar west of Nepal,
p75
aVthe most impoverished region of Nepal,
p76
aVan old man came in
p77
aVclutching a bundle of rags.
p78
aVAnd he walked in, and somebody said something to him,
p79
aVwe realized he was deaf,
p80
aVand we looked into the rags,
p81
aVand there was this pair of eyes.
p82
aVThe rags were unwrapped
p83
aVfrom a little girl
p84
aVwhose body was massively burned.
p85
aVAgain,
p86
aVthe eyes and hands
p87
aVof Avalokiteshvara.
p88
aVIt was the young women, the health aids,
p89
aVwho cleaned the wounds of this baby
p90
aVand dressed the wounds.
p91
aa(lp92
VI know those hands and eyes;
p93
aVthey touched me as well.
p94
aVThey touched me at that time.
p95
aVThey have touched me throughout my 68 years.
p96
aVThey touched me when I was four
p97
aVand I lost my eyesight
p98
aVand was partially paralyzed.
p99
aVAnd my family brought in
p100
aVa woman whose mother had been a slave
p101
aVto take care of me.
p102
aVAnd that woman
p103
aVdid not have sentimental compassion.
p104
aVShe had phenomenal strength.
p105
aVAnd it was really her strength, I believe,
p106
aVthat became the kind of mudra and imprimatur
p107
aVthat has been a guiding light in my life.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo we can ask:
p110
aVWhat is compassion comprised of?
p111
aVAnd there are various facets.
p112
aVAnd there's referential and non-referential compassion.
p113
aVBut first, compassion is comprised
p114
aVof that capacity
p115
aVto see clearly
p116
aVinto the nature of suffering.
p117
aVIt is that ability
p118
aVto really stand strong
p119
aVand to recognize also
p120
aVthat I'm not separate from this suffering.
p121
aVBut that is not enough,
p122
aVbecause compassion,
p123
aVwhich activates the motor cortex,
p124
aVmeans that we aspire,
p125
aVwe actually aspire to transform suffering.
p126
aVAnd if we're so blessed,
p127
aVwe engage in activities
p128
aVthat transform suffering.
p129
aVBut compassion has another component,
p130
aVand that component is really essential.
p131
aVThat component
p132
aVis that we cannot be attached to outcome.
p133
aa(lp134
VNow I worked with dying people
p135
aVfor over 40 years.
p136
aVI had the privilege of working on death row
p137
aVin a maximum security [prison] for six years.
p138
aVAnd I realized so clearly
p139
aVin bringing my own life experience,
p140
aVfrom working with dying people
p141
aVand training caregivers,
p142
aVthat any attachment to outcome
p143
aVwould distort deeply
p144
aVmy own capacity to be fully present
p145
aVto the whole catastrophe.
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd when I worked in the prison system,
p148
aVit was so clear to me, this:
p149
aVthat many of us
p150
aVin this room,
p151
aVand almost all of the men that I worked with on death row,
p152
aVthe seeds of their own compassion had never been watered.
p153
aVThat compassion is actually
p154
aVan inherent human quality.
p155
aVIt is there within every human being.
p156
aVBut the conditions
p157
aVfor compassion to be activated,
p158
aVto be aroused,
p159
aVare particular conditions.
p160
aVI had that condition, to a certain extent,
p161
aVfrom my own childhood illness.
p162
aVEve Ensler, whom you'll hear later,
p163
aVhas had that condition activated
p164
aVamazingly in her
p165
aVthrough the various waters of suffering
p166
aVthat she has been through.
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd what is fascinating
p169
aVis that compassion has enemies,
p170
aVand those enemies are things like pity,
p171
aVmoral outrage,
p172
aVfear.
p173
aVAnd you know, we have a society, a world,
p174
aVthat is paralyzed by fear.
p175
aVAnd in that paralysis, of course,
p176
aVour capacity for compassion
p177
aVis also paralyzed.
p178
aVThe very word terror
p179
aVis global.
p180
aVThe very feeling of terror is global.
p181
aVSo our work, in a certain way,
p182
aVis to address this imago,
p183
aVthis kind of archetype
p184
aVthat has pervaded the psyche
p185
aVof our entire globe.
p186
aa(lp187
VNow we know from neuroscience
p188
aVthat compassion has
p189
aVsome very extraordinary qualities.
p190
aVFor example:
p191
aVA person who is cultivating compassion,
p192
aVwhen they are in the presence of suffering,
p193
aVthey feel that suffering a lot more
p194
aVthan many other people do.
p195
aVHowever,
p196
aVthey return to baseline a lot sooner.
p197
aVThis is called resilience.
p198
aVMany of us think that compassion drains us,
p199
aVbut I promise you
p200
aVit is something that truly enlivens us.
p201
aa(lp202
VAnother thing about compassion
p203
aVis that it really enhances what's called neural integration.
p204
aVIt hooks up all parts of the brain.
p205
aVAnother, which has been discovered
p206
aVby various researchers
p207
aVat Emory and at Davis and so on,
p208
aVis that compassion enhances our immune system.
p209
aVHey,
p210
aVwe live in a very noxious world.
p211
aV(Laughter)
p212
aVMost of us are shrinking
p213
aVin the face of psycho-social and physical poisons,
p214
aVof the toxins of our world.
p215
aVBut compassion, the generation of compassion,
p216
aVactually mobilizes
p217
aVour immunity.
p218
aa(lp219
VYou know, if compassion is so good for us,
p220
aVI have a question.
p221
aVWhy don't we train our children
p222
aVin compassion?
p223
aV(Applause)
p224
aVIf compassion is so good for us,
p225
aVwhy don't we train our health care providers in compassion
p226
aVso that they can do what they're supposed to do,
p227
aVwhich is to really transform suffering?
p228
aVAnd if compassion is so good for us,
p229
aVwhy don't we vote on compassion?
p230
aVWhy don't we vote for people in our government
p231
aVbased on compassion,
p232
aVso that we can have
p233
aVa more caring world?
p234
aVIn Buddhism,
p235
aVwe say, "it takes a strong back and a soft front."
p236
aVIt takes tremendous strength of the back
p237
aVto uphold yourself in the midst of conditions.
p238
aVAnd that is the mental quality of equanimity.
p239
aa(lp240
VBut it also takes a soft front \u2014
p241
aVthe capacity to really be open to the world as it is,
p242
aVto have an undefended heart.
p243
aVAnd the archetype of this in Buddhism
p244
aVis Avalokiteshvara, Kuan-Yin.
p245
aVIt's a female archetype:
p246
aVshe who perceives
p247
aVthe cries of suffering in the world.
p248
aVShe stands with 10,000 arms,
p249
aVand in every hand,
p250
aVthere is an instrument of liberation,
p251
aVand in the palm of every hand, there are eyes,
p252
aVand these are the eyes of wisdom.
p253
aVI say that, for thousands of years,
p254
aVwomen have lived,
p255
aVexemplified, met in intimacy,
p256
aVthe archetype of Avalokitesvara,
p257
aVof Kuan-Yin,
p258
aVshe who perceives
p259
aVthe cries of suffering in the world.
p260
aa(lp261
VWomen have manifested for thousands of years
p262
aVthe strength arising from compassion
p263
aVin an unfiltered, unmediated way
p264
aVin perceiving suffering
p265
aVas it is.
p266
aVThey have infused societies with kindness,
p267
aVand we have really felt that
p268
aVas woman after woman
p269
aVhas stood on this stage
p270
aVin the past day and a half.
p271
aVAnd they have actualized compassion
p272
aVthrough direct action.
p273
aVJody Williams called it:
p274
aVIt's good to meditate.
p275
aVI'm sorry, you've got to do a little bit of that, Jody.
p276
aVStep back, give your mother a break, okay.
p277
aa(lp278
V(Laughter)
p279
aa(lp280
VBut the other side of the equation
p281
aVis you've got to come out of your cave.
p282
aVYou have to come into the world
p283
aVlike Asanga did,
p284
aVwho was looking to realize Maitreya Buddha
p285
aVafter 12 years sitting in the cave.
p286
aVHe said, "I'm out of here."
p287
aVHe's going down the path.
p288
aVHe sees something in the path.
p289
aVHe looks, it's a dog, he drops to his knees.
p290
aVHe sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg.
p291
aVThe wound is just filled with maggots.
p292
aVHe puts out his tongue
p293
aVin order to remove the maggots,
p294
aVso as not to harm them.
p295
aVAnd at that moment,
p296
aVthe dog transformed
p297
aVinto the Buddha of love and kindness.
p298
aa(lp299
VI believe
p300
aVthat women and girls today
p301
aVhave to partner in a powerful way with men \u2014
p302
aVwith their fathers,
p303
aVwith their sons, with their brothers,
p304
aVwith the plumbers, the road builders,
p305
aVthe caregivers, the doctors, the lawyers,
p306
aVwith our president,
p307
aVand with all beings.
p308
aVThe women in this room
p309
aVare lotuses in a sea of fire.
p310
aVMay we actualize that capacity
p311
aVfor women everywhere.
p312
aa(lp313
VThank you.

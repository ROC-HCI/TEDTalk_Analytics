VI got up this morning at 6:10 a.m.
p5
aVafter going to sleep at 12:45 a.m.
p6
aVI was awakened once during the night.
p7
aVMy heart rate was 61 beats per minute \u2014
p8
aVmy blood pressure, 127 over 74.
p9
aVI had zero minutes of exercise yesterday,
p10
aVso my maximum heart rate during exercise wasn't calculated.
p11
aVI had about 600 milligrams of caffeine,
p12
aVzero of alcohol.
p13
aVAnd my score on the Narcissism Personality Index,
p14
aVor the NPI-16,
p15
aVis a reassuring 0.31.
p16
aa(lp17
VWe know that numbers are useful for us
p18
aVwhen we advertise, manage, govern, search.
p19
aVI'm going to talk about how they're useful when we reflect,
p20
aVlearn, remember
p21
aVand want to improve.
p22
aVA few years ago, Kevin Kelly, my partner, and I
p23
aVnoticed that people were subjecting themselves
p24
aVto regimes of quantitative measurement and self-tracking
p25
aVthat went far beyond the ordinary, familiar habits
p26
aVsuch as stepping on a scale every day.
p27
aVPeople were tracking their food via Twitter,
p28
aVtheir kids' diapers on their iPhone.
p29
aVThey were making detailed journals
p30
aVof their spending, their mood,
p31
aVtheir symptoms, their treatments.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow, we know some of the technological facts
p34
aVthat are driving this change in our lifestyle \u2014
p35
aVthe uptake and diffusion of mobile devices,
p36
aVthe exponential improvement in data storage
p37
aVand data processing,
p38
aVand the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors.
p39
aVThis little black dot there
p40
aVis a 3D accelerometer.
p41
aVIt tracks your movement through space.
p42
aVIt is, as you can see, very small and also very cheap.
p43
aVThey're now down to well under a dollar a piece,
p44
aVand they're going into all kinds of devices.
p45
aVBut what's interesting
p46
aVis the incredible detailed information that you can get
p47
aVfrom just one sensor like this.
p48
aVThis kind of sensor
p49
aVis in the hit biometric device \u2014
p50
aVamong early adopters at the moment \u2014 the Fitbit.
p51
aVThis tracks your activity and also your sleep.
p52
aVIt has just that sensor in it.
p53
aa(lp54
VYou're probably familiar with the Nike+ system.
p55
aVI just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor.
p56
aVIt's really just a pressure sensor
p57
aVlike the kind that's in a doorbell.
p58
aVAnd Nike knows how to get
p59
aVyour pace and distance from just that sensor.
p60
aVThis is the strap
p61
aVthat people use to transmit heart-rate data
p62
aVto their Nike+ system.
p63
aa(lp64
VThis is a beautiful, new device
p65
aVthat gives you detailed sleep tracking data,
p66
aVnot just whether you're asleep or awake, but also your phase of sleep \u2014
p67
aVdeep sleep, light sleep, REM sleep.
p68
aVThe sensor is just a little strip of metal in that headband there.
p69
aVThe rest of it is the bedside console;
p70
aVjust for reference, this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago \u2014
p71
aVI mean, really until now.
p72
aVAnd this is the sleep tracking system of today.
p73
aa(lp74
VThis just was presented
p75
aVat a health care conference in D.C.
p76
aVMost of what you see there is an asthma inhaler,
p77
aVbut the top is a very small GPS transceiver,
p78
aVwhich gives you the date and location
p79
aVof an asthma incident,
p80
aVgiving you a new awareness
p81
aVof your vulnerability
p82
aVin relation to time and environmental factors.
p83
aa(lp84
VNow, we know that new tools
p85
aVare changing our sense of self in the world \u2014
p86
aVthese tiny sensors that gather data in nature,
p87
aVthe ubiquitous computing
p88
aVthat allows that data to be understood and used,
p89
aVand of course the social networks
p90
aVthat allow people to collaborate and contribute.
p91
aVBut we think of these tools as pointing outward,
p92
aVas windows
p93
aVand I'd just like to invite you to think of them
p94
aVas also turning inward
p95
aVand becoming mirrors.
p96
aVSo that when we think about using them
p97
aVto get some systematic improvement,
p98
aVwe also think about how they can be useful for self-improvement,
p99
aVfor self-discovery, self-awareness, self-knowledge.
p100
aa(lp101
VHere's a biometric device:
p102
aVa pair of Apple Earbuds.
p103
aVLast year, Apple filed some patents
p104
aVto get blood oxygenation,
p105
aVheart rate and body temperature via the Earbuds.
p106
aVWhat is this for?
p107
aVWhat should it be for?
p108
aVSome people will say it's for biometric security.
p109
aVSome people will say it's for public health research.
p110
aVSome people will say it's for avant-garde marketing research.
p111
aVI'd like to tell you
p112
aVthat it's also for self-knowledge.
p113
aVAnd the self isn't the only thing; it's not even most things.
p114
aVThe self is just our operation center,
p115
aVour consciousness,
p116
aVour moral compass.
p117
aVSo, if we want to act
p118
aVmore effectively in the world,
p119
aVwe have to get to know ourselves better.
p120
aa(lp121
VThank you.

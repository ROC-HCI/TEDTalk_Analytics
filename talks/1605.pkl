VWhat I want you all to do right now
p5
aVis to think of this mammal that I'm going to describe to you.
p6
aVThe first thing I'm going to tell you about this mammal
p7
aVis that it is essential for our ecosystems to function correctly.
p8
aVIf we remove this mammal from our ecosystems,
p9
aVthey simply will not work.
p10
aVThat's the first thing.
p11
aVThe second thing is that due to the unique sensory abilities
p12
aVof this mammal, if we study this mammal,
p13
aVwe're going to get great insight into our diseases
p14
aVof the senses, such as blindness and deafness.
p15
aVAnd the third really intriguing aspect of this mammal
p16
aVis that I fully believe that the secret of everlasting youth
p17
aVlies deep within its DNA.
p18
aVSo are you all thinking?
p19
aVSo,
p20
aVmagnificent creature, isn't it?
p21
aVWho here thought of a bat?
p22
aVAh, I can see half the audience agrees with me,
p23
aVand I have a lot of work to do to convince the rest of you.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo I have had the good fortune for the past 20 years
p26
aVto study these fascinating and beautiful mammals.
p27
aVOne fifth of all living mammals is a bat,
p28
aVand they have very unique attributes.
p29
aVBats as we know them have been around on this planet
p30
aVfor about 64 million years.
p31
aVOne of the most unique things that bats do
p32
aVas a mammal is that they fly.
p33
aVNow flight is an inherently difficult thing.
p34
aVFlight within vertebrates has only evolved three times:
p35
aVonce in the bats, once in the birds,
p36
aVand once in the pterodactyls.
p37
aVAnd so with flight, it's very metabolically costly.
p38
aVBats have learned and evolved how to deal with this.
p39
aa(lp40
VBut one other extremely unique thing about bats
p41
aVis that they are able to use sound
p42
aVto perceive their environment. They use echolocation.
p43
aVNow, what I mean by echolocation \u2014
p44
aVthey emit a sound from their larynx out through their mouth
p45
aVor through their nose. This sound wave comes out
p46
aVand it reflects and echoes back off objects in their environment,
p47
aVand the bats then hear these echoes
p48
aVand they turn this information into an acoustic image.
p49
aVAnd this enables them to orient in complete darkness.
p50
aVIndeed, they do look very strange. We're humans.
p51
aVWe're a visual species. When scientists first realized
p52
aVthat bats were actually using sound to be able to fly
p53
aVand orient and move at night, we didn't believe it.
p54
aVFor a hundred years, despite evidence to show
p55
aVthat this is what they were doing, we didn't believe it.
p56
aa(lp57
VNow, if you look at this bat, it looks a little bit alien.
p58
aVIndeed, the very famous philosopher Thomas Nagel
p59
aVonce said, "To truly experience an alien life form
p60
aVon this planet, you should lock yourself inside a room
p61
aVwith a flying, echolocating bat in complete darkness."
p62
aVAnd if you look at the actual physical characteristics
p63
aVon the face of this beautiful horseshoe bat,
p64
aVyou see a lot of these characteristics are dedicated
p65
aVto be able to make sound and perceive it.
p66
aVVery big ears, strange nose leaves, but teeny-tiny eyes.
p67
aVSo again, if you just look at this bat, you realize
p68
aVsound is very important for its survival.
p69
aa(lp70
VMost bats look like the previous one.
p71
aVHowever, there are a group that do not use echolocation.
p72
aVThey do not perceive their environment using sound,
p73
aVand these are the flying foxes.
p74
aVIf anybody has ever been lucky enough to be in Australia,
p75
aVyou've seen them coming out of the Botanic Gardens in Sydney,
p76
aVand if you just look at their face, you can see
p77
aVthey have much, much larger eyes and much smaller ears.
p78
aVSo among and within bats is a huge variation
p79
aVin their ability to use sensory perception.
p80
aVNow this is going to be important for what I'm going
p81
aVto tell you later during the talk.
p82
aa(lp83
VNow, if the idea of bats in your belfry terrifies you,
p84
aVand I know some people probably are feeling a little sick
p85
aVlooking at very large images of bats,
p86
aVthat's probably not that surprising,
p87
aVbecause here in Western culture,
p88
aVbats have been demonized.
p89
aVReally, of course the famous book "Dracula,"
p90
aVwritten by a fellow Northside Dubliner Bram Stoker,
p91
aVprobably is mainly responsible for this.
p92
aVHowever, I also think it's got to do with the fact
p93
aVthat bats come out at night, and we don't
p94
aVreally understand them. We're a little frightened by things
p95
aVthat can perceive the world slightly differently than us.
p96
aVBats are usually synonymous with some type of evil events.
p97
aVThey are the perpetrators in horror movies,
p98
aVsuch as this famous "Nightwing."
p99
aVAlso, if you think about it, demons
p100
aValways have bat wings, whereas birds, they typically \u2014
p101
aVor angels have bird wings.
p102
aa(lp103
VNow, this is Western society, and what I hope to do tonight
p104
aVis to convince you of the Chinese traditional culture,
p105
aVthat they perceive bats as
p106
aVcreatures that bring good luck, and indeed, if you walk
p107
aVinto a Chinese home, you may see an image such as this.
p108
aVThis is considered the Five Blessings.
p109
aVThe Chinese word for "bat" sounds like the Chinese word
p110
aVfor "happiness," and they believe that bats
p111
aVbring wealth, health, longevity, virtue and serenity.
p112
aVAnd indeed, in this image, you have a picture of longevity
p113
aVsurrounded by five bats.
p114
aVAnd what I want to do tonight is to talk to you
p115
aVand to show you that at least three of these blessings
p116
aVare definitely represented by a bat, and that if we study bats
p117
aVwe will get nearer to getting each of these blessings.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo, wealth \u2014 how can a bat possibly bring us wealth?
p120
aVNow as I said before, bats are essential for our ecosystems
p121
aVto function correctly. And why is this?
p122
aVBats in the tropics are major pollinators of many plants.
p123
aVThey also feed on fruit, and they disperse the seeds
p124
aVof these fruits. Bats are responsible for pollinating
p125
aVthe tequila plant, and this is a multi-million dollar industry
p126
aVin Mexico. So indeed, we need them
p127
aVfor our ecosystems to function properly.
p128
aVWithout them, it's going to be a problem.
p129
aVBut most bats are voracious insect predators.
p130
aVIt's been estimated in the U.S., in a tiny colony
p131
aVof big brown bats, that they will feed
p132
aVon over a million insects a year,
p133
aVand in the United States of America, right now
p134
aVbats are being threatened by a disease known as white-nose syndrome.
p135
aVIt's working its way slowly across the U.S. and wiping out
p136
aVpopulations of bats, and scientists have estimated
p137
aVthat 1,300 metric tons of insects a year are now
p138
aVremaining in the ecosystems due to the loss of bats.
p139
aVBats are also threatened in the U.S.
p140
aVby their attraction to wind farms. Again, right now
p141
aVbats are looking at a little bit of a problem.
p142
aVThey're going to \u2014 They are very threatened
p143
aVin the United States of America alone.
p144
aa(lp145
VNow how can this help us?
p146
aVWell, it has been calculated that if we were to remove bats
p147
aVfrom the equation, we're going to have to then use
p148
aVinsecticides to remove all those pest insects
p149
aVthat feed on our agricultural crops.
p150
aVAnd for one year in the U.S. alone, it's estimated
p151
aVthat it's going to cost 22 billion U.S. dollars,
p152
aVif we remove bats. So indeed, bats then do bring us wealth.
p153
aVThey maintain the health of our ecosystems,
p154
aVand also they save us money.
p155
aVSo again, that's the first blessing. Bats are important
p156
aVfor our ecosystems.
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd what about the second? What about health?
p159
aVInside every cell in your body lies your genome.
p160
aVYour genome is made up of your DNA,
p161
aVyour DNA codes for proteins that enable you to function
p162
aVand interact and be as you are.
p163
aVNow since the new advancements in modern molecular technologies,
p164
aVit is now possible for us to sequence our own genome
p165
aVin a very rapid time and at a very, very reduced cost.
p166
aVNow when we've been doing this, we've realized
p167
aVthat there's variations within our genome.
p168
aVSo I want you to look at the person beside you.
p169
aVJust have a quick look. And what we need to realize
p170
aVis that every 300 base pairs in your DNA, you're a little bit different.
p171
aVAnd one of the grand challenges right now
p172
aVin modern molecular medicine is to work out
p173
aVwhether this variation makes you more susceptible to diseases,
p174
aVor does this variation just make you different?
p175
aVAgain, what does it mean here? What does this variation
p176
aVactually mean? So if we are to capitalize on all of this
p177
aVnew molecular data and personalized genomic information
p178
aVthat is coming online that we will be able to have
p179
aVin the next few years, we have to be able to differentiate
p180
aVbetween the two. So how do we do this?
p181
aa(lp182
VWell, I believe we just look at nature's experiments.
p183
aVSo through natural selection, over time,
p184
aVmutations, variations that disrupt the function of a protein
p185
aVwill not be tolerated over time.
p186
aVEvolution acts as a sieve. It sieves out the bad variation.
p187
aVAnd so therefore, if you look at the same region
p188
aVof a genome in many mammals that have been
p189
aVevolutionarily distant from each other
p190
aVand are also ecologically divergent, you will get a better
p191
aVunderstanding of what the evolutionary prior of that site is,
p192
aVi.e., if it is important for the mammal to function,
p193
aVfor its survival, it will be the same
p194
aVin all of those different lineages, species, taxa.
p195
aVSo therefore, if we were to do this,
p196
aVwhat we'd need to do is sequence that region
p197
aVin all these different mammals and ascertain if it's the same
p198
aVor if it's different. So if it is the same,
p199
aVthis indicates that that site is important for a function,
p200
aVso a disease mutation should fall within that site.
p201
aVSo in this case here, if all the mammals that we look at
p202
aVhave a yellow-type genome at that site,
p203
aVit probably suggests that purple is bad.
p204
aVThis could be even more powerful if you look at mammals
p205
aVthat are doing things slightly differently.
p206
aVSo say, for example, the region of the genome
p207
aVthat I was looking at was a region that's important for vision.
p208
aVIf we look at that region in mammals that don't see so well,
p209
aVsuch as bats, and we find that bats that don't see so well
p210
aVhave the purple type, we know that this is probably
p211
aVwhat's causing this disease.
p212
aa(lp213
VSo in my lab, we've been using bats to look at two different
p214
aVtypes of diseases of the senses.
p215
aVWe're looking at blindness. Now why would you do this?
p216
aVThree hundred and fourteen million people are visually impaired, and
p217
aV45 million of these are blind. So blindness is a big problem,
p218
aVand a lot of these blind disorders come from inherited diseases,
p219
aVso we want to try and better understand
p220
aVwhich mutations in the gene cause the disease.
p221
aVAlso we look at deafness. One in every 1,000
p222
aVnewborn babies are deaf, and when we reach 80,
p223
aVover half of us will also have a hearing problem.
p224
aVAgain, there's many underlying genetic causes for this.
p225
aVSo what we've been doing in my lab
p226
aVis looking at these unique sensory specialists, the bats,
p227
aVand we have looked at genes that cause blindness
p228
aVwhen there's a defect in them,
p229
aVgenes that cause deafness when there's a defect in them,
p230
aVand now we can predict which sites are most likely to cause disease.
p231
aVSo bats are also important for our health,
p232
aVto enable us to better understand how our genome functions.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo this is where we are right now,
p235
aVbut what about the future?
p236
aVWhat about longevity?
p237
aVThis is where we're going to go, and as I said before,
p238
aVI really believe that the secret of everlasting youth
p239
aVlies within the bat genome.
p240
aVSo why should we be interested in aging at all?
p241
aVWell, really, this is a picture drawn from the 1500s
p242
aVof the Fountain of Youth. Aging is considered
p243
aVone of the most familiar, yet the least well-understood,
p244
aVaspects of all of biology, and really,
p245
aVsince the dawn of civilization, mankind has sought to avoid it.
p246
aVBut we are going to have to understand it a bit better.
p247
aVIn Europe alone, by 2050, there is going to be
p248
aVa 70 percent increase of individuals over 65,
p249
aVand 170 percent increase in individuals over 80.
p250
aVAs we age, we deteriorate, and this deterioration
p251
aVcauses problems for our society, so we have to address it.
p252
aa(lp253
VSo how could the secret of everlasting youth actually lie
p254
aVwithin the bat genome? Does anybody want to hazard
p255
aVa guess over how long this bat could live for?
p256
aVWho \u2014 put up your hands \u2014 who says two years?
p257
aVNobody? One? How about 10 years?
p258
aVSome? How about 30?
p259
aVHow about 40? Okay, it's a whole varied response.
p260
aVThis bat is myotis brandtii. It's the longest-living bat.
p261
aVIt lived for up to 42 years,
p262
aVand this bat's still alive in the wild today.
p263
aVBut what would be so amazing about this?
p264
aa(lp265
VWell, typically, in mammals there is a relationship
p266
aVbetween body size, metabolic rate,
p267
aVand how long you can live for, and you can predict
p268
aVhow long a mammal can live for given its body size.
p269
aVSo typically, small mammals live fast, die young.
p270
aVThink of a mouse. But bats are very different.
p271
aVAs you can see here on this graph, in blue,
p272
aVthese are all other mammals, but bats
p273
aVcan live up to nine times longer than expected
p274
aVdespite having a really, really high metabolic rate,
p275
aVand the question is, how can they do that?
p276
aVThere are 19 species of mammal that live longer
p277
aVthan expected, given their body size, than man,
p278
aVand 18 of those are bats.
p279
aVSo therefore, they must have something within their DNA
p280
aVthat ables them to deal with the metabolic stresses,
p281
aVparticularly of flight. They expend three times more energy
p282
aVthan a mammal of the same size,
p283
aVbut don't seem to suffer the consequences or the effects.
p284
aVSo right now, in my lab, we're combining
p285
aVstate-of-the-art bat field biology, going out and catching
p286
aVthe long-lived bats, with the most up-to-date,
p287
aVmodern molecular technology to understand better
p288
aVwhat it is that they do to stop aging as we do.
p289
aVAnd hopefully in the next five years, I'll be giving you a TEDTalk on that.
p290
aVAging is a big problem for humanity,
p291
aVand I believe that by studying bats, we can uncover
p292
aVthe molecular mechanisms that enable mammals
p293
aVto achieve extraordinary longevity. If we find out
p294
aVwhat they're doing, perhaps through gene therapy,
p295
aVwe can enable us to do the same thing.
p296
aVPotentially, this means that we could halt aging or maybe even reverse it.
p297
aVJust imagine what that would be like.
p298
aa(lp299
VSo really, I don't think we should be thinking of them
p300
aVas flying demons of the night, but more as our superheroes.
p301
aVAnd the reality is that bats can bring us so much benefit
p302
aVif we just look in the right place. They're good for our ecosystem,
p303
aVthey allow us to understand how our genome functions,
p304
aVand they potentially hold the secret to everlasting youth.
p305
aVSo tonight, when you walk out of here and you look up
p306
aVin the night skies, and you see this beautiful flying mammal,
p307
aVI want you to smile. Thank you. (Applause)

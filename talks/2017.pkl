VI grew up in a very small country town
p5
aVin Victoria.
p6
aVI had a very normal, low-key kind of upbringing.
p7
aVI went to school, I hung out with my friends,
p8
aVI fought with my younger sisters.
p9
aVIt was all very normal.
p10
aVAnd when I was 15, a member of my local community
p11
aVapproached my parents
p12
aVand wanted to nominate me
p13
aVfor a community achievement award.
p14
aVAnd my parents said, "Hm, that's really nice,
p15
aVbut there's kind of one glaring problem with that.
p16
aVShe hasn't actually achieved anything." (Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd they were right, you know.
p19
aVI went to school, I got good marks,
p20
aVI had a very low-key after school job
p21
aVin my mum's hairdressing salon,
p22
aVand I spent a lot of time watching
p23
aV"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Dawson's Creek."
p24
aVYeah, I know. What a contradiction.
p25
aVBut they were right, you know.
p26
aVI wasn't doing anything that was out of the ordinary
p27
aVat all.
p28
aVI wasn't doing anything that could be considered an achievement
p29
aVif you took disability out of the equation.
p30
aVYears later, I was on my second teaching round
p31
aVin a Melbourne high school,
p32
aVand I was about 20 minutes into a year 11 legal studies class
p33
aVwhen this boy put up his hand and said,
p34
aV"Hey miss, when are you going to start doing your speech?"
p35
aVAnd I said, "What speech?"
p36
aVYou know, I'd been talking them
p37
aVabout defamation law for a good 20 minutes.
p38
aVAnd he said, "You know, like,
p39
aVyour motivational speaking.
p40
aVYou know, when people in wheelchairs come to school,
p41
aVthey usually say, like, inspirational stuff?"
p42
aV(Laughter)
p43
aV"It's usually in the big hall."
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd that's when it dawned on me:
p46
aVThis kid had only ever experienced disabled people
p47
aVas objects of inspiration.
p48
aVWe are not, to this kid \u2014
p49
aVand it's not his fault, I mean,
p50
aVthat's true for many of us.
p51
aVFor lots of us, disabled people are not our teachers
p52
aVor our doctors or our manicurists.
p53
aVWe're not real people. We are there to inspire.
p54
aVAnd in fact, I am sitting on this stage
p55
aVlooking like I do in this wheelchair,
p56
aVand you are probably kind of expecting me
p57
aVto inspire you. Right? (Laughter)
p58
aVYeah.
p59
aa(lp60
VWell, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid
p61
aVI'm going to disappoint you dramatically.
p62
aVI am not here to inspire you.
p63
aVI am here to tell you that we have been lied to
p64
aVabout disability.
p65
aVYeah, we've been sold the lie
p66
aVthat disability is a Bad Thing, capital B, capital T.
p67
aVIt's a bad thing, and to live with a disability
p68
aVmakes you exceptional.
p69
aVIt's not a bad thing, and it doesn't
p70
aVmake you exceptional.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd in the past few years, we've been able
p73
aVto propagate this lie even further
p74
aVvia social media.
p75
aVYou may have seen images like this one:
p76
aV"The only disability in life is a bad attitude."
p77
aVOr this one: "Your excuse is invalid." Indeed.
p78
aVOr this one: "Before you quit, try!"
p79
aVThese are just a couple of examples,
p80
aVbut there are a lot of these images out there.
p81
aVYou know, you might have seen the one,
p82
aVthe little girl with no hands
p83
aVdrawing a picture with a pencil held in her mouth.
p84
aVYou might have seen a child running
p85
aVon carbon fiber prosthetic legs.
p86
aVAnd these images,
p87
aVthere are lots of them out there,
p88
aVthey are what we call inspiration porn.
p89
aV(Laughter)
p90
aVAnd I use the term porn deliberately,
p91
aVbecause they objectify one group of people
p92
aVfor the benefit of another group of people.
p93
aVSo in this case, we're objectifying disabled people
p94
aVfor the benefit of nondisabled people.
p95
aVThe purpose of these images
p96
aVis to inspire you, to motivate you,
p97
aVso that we can look at them
p98
aVand think, "Well, however bad my life is,
p99
aVit could be worse.
p100
aVI could be that person."
p101
aa(lp102
VBut what if you are that person?
p103
aVI've lost count of the number of times that I've
p104
aVbeen approached by strangers
p105
aVwanting to tell me that they think I'm brave
p106
aVor inspirational,
p107
aVand this was long before my work
p108
aVhad any kind of public profile.
p109
aVThey were just kind of congratulating me
p110
aVfor managing to get up in the morning
p111
aVand remember my own name. (Laughter)
p112
aVAnd it is objectifying.
p113
aVThese images, those images
p114
aVobjectify disabled people
p115
aVfor the benefit of nondisabled people.
p116
aVThey are there so that you can look at them
p117
aVand think that things aren't so bad for you,
p118
aVto put your worries into perspective.
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd life as a disabled person
p121
aVis actually somewhat difficult.
p122
aVWe do overcome some things.
p123
aVBut the things that we're overcoming
p124
aVare not the things that you think they are.
p125
aVThey are not things to do with our bodies.
p126
aVI use the term "disabled people" quite deliberately,
p127
aVbecause I subscribe to what's called the social model of disability,
p128
aVwhich tells us that we are more disabled
p129
aVby the society that we live in
p130
aVthan by our bodies and our diagnoses.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo I have lived in this body a long time.
p133
aVI'm quite fond of it.
p134
aVIt does the things that I need it to do,
p135
aVand I've learned to use it to the best of its capacity
p136
aVjust as you have,
p137
aVand that's the thing about those kids in those pictures as well.
p138
aVThey're not doing anything out of the ordinary.
p139
aVThey are just using their bodies
p140
aVto the best of their capacity.
p141
aVSo is it really fair to objectify them
p142
aVin the way that we do,
p143
aVto share those images?
p144
aVPeople, when they say, "You're an inspiration,"
p145
aVthey mean it as a compliment.
p146
aVAnd I know why it happens.
p147
aVIt's because of the lie, it's because we've been sold
p148
aVthis lie that disability makes you exceptional.
p149
aVAnd it honestly doesn't.
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd I know what you're thinking.
p152
aVYou know, I'm up here bagging out inspiration,
p153
aVand you're thinking, "Jeez, Stella,
p154
aVaren't you inspired sometimes by some things?"
p155
aVAnd the thing is, I am.
p156
aVI learn from other disabled people all the time.
p157
aVI'm learning not that I am luckier than them, though.
p158
aVI am learning that it's a genius idea
p159
aVto use a pair of barbecue tongs
p160
aVto pick up things that you dropped. (Laughter)
p161
aVI'm learning that nifty trick where you can charge
p162
aVyour mobile phone battery from your chair battery.
p163
aVGenius.
p164
aVWe are learning from each others' strength and endurance,
p165
aVnot against our bodies and our diagnoses,
p166
aVbut against a world that exceptionalizes
p167
aVand objectifies us.
p168
aa(lp169
VI really think that this lie that we've been sold
p170
aVabout disability is the greatest injustice.
p171
aVIt makes life hard for us.
p172
aVAnd that quote, "The only disability in life
p173
aVis a bad attitude,"
p174
aVthe reason that that's bullshit
p175
aVis because it's just not true,
p176
aVbecause of the social model of disability.
p177
aVNo amount of smiling at a flight of stairs
p178
aVhas ever made it turn into a ramp.
p179
aVNever. (Laughter) (Applause)
p180
aVSmiling at a television screen
p181
aVisn't going to make closed captions appear
p182
aVfor people who are deaf.
p183
aVNo amount of standing in the middle of a bookshop
p184
aVand radiating a positive attitude
p185
aVis going to turn all those books into braille.
p186
aVIt's just not going to happen.
p187
aa(lp188
VI really want to live in a world
p189
aVwhere disability is not the exception, but the norm.
p190
aVI want to live in a world where a 15-year-old girl
p191
aVsitting in her bedroom
p192
aVwatching "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"
p193
aVisn't referred to as achieving anything
p194
aVbecause she's doing it sitting down.
p195
aVI want to live in a world
p196
aVwhere we don't have such low expectations
p197
aVof disabled people
p198
aVthat we are congratulated for getting out of bed
p199
aVand remembering our own names in the morning.
p200
aVI want to live in a world where we value genuine achievement
p201
aVfor disabled people,
p202
aVand I want to live in a world
p203
aVwhere a kid in year 11 in a Melbourne high school
p204
aVis not one bit surprised
p205
aVthat his new teacher is a wheelchair user.
p206
aa(lp207
VDisability doesn't make you exceptional,
p208
aVbut questioning what you think you know about it does.
p209
aa(lp210
VThank you.

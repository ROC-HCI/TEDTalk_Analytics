VOkay, so
p5
aV90 percent of my photographic process
p6
aVis, in fact, not photographic.
p7
aVIt involves a campaign of letter writing,
p8
aVresearch and phone calls
p9
aVto access my subjects,
p10
aVwhich can range from Hamas leaders in Gaza
p11
aVto a hibernating black bear in its cave
p12
aVin West Virginia.
p13
aVAnd oddly, the most notable
p14
aVletter of rejection I ever received
p15
aVcame from Walt Disney World,
p16
aVa seemingly innocuous site.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd it read \u2014 I'm just going to read a key sentence:
p19
aV"Especially during these violent times,
p20
aVI personally believe
p21
aVthat the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks
p22
aVis particularly important to protect
p23
aVand helps to provide them with an important fantasy
p24
aVthey can escape to."
p25
aa(lp26
VPhotography threatens fantasy.
p27
aVThey didn't want to let my camera in
p28
aVbecause it confronts constructed realities, myths and beliefs,
p29
aVand provides what appears to be
p30
aVevidence of a truth.
p31
aVBut there are multiple truths attached to every image,
p32
aVdepending on the creator's intention, the viewer
p33
aVand the context in which it is presented.
p34
aa(lp35
VOver a five year period following September 11th,
p36
aVwhen the American media and government were seeking
p37
aVhidden and unknown sites
p38
aVbeyond its borders,
p39
aVmost notably weapons of mass destruction,
p40
aVI chose to look inward at that which was integral
p41
aVto America's foundation,
p42
aVmythology and daily functioning.
p43
aVI wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen,
p44
aVself-imposed and real,
p45
aVand confront the divide between privileged
p46
aVand public access to knowledge.
p47
aa(lp48
VIt was a critical moment in American history
p49
aVand global history
p50
aVwhere one felt they didn't have access to accurate information.
p51
aVAnd I wanted to see the center with my own eyes,
p52
aVbut what I came away with is a photograph.
p53
aVAnd it's just another place from which to observe,
p54
aVand the understanding that
p55
aVthere are no absolute, all-knowing insiders.
p56
aVAnd the outsider can never really reach the core.
p57
aa(lp58
VI'm going to run through some of the photographs in this series.
p59
aVIt's titled, "An American Index
p60
aVof the Hidden and Unfamiliar,"
p61
aVand it's comprised of nearly 70 images.
p62
aVIn this context I'll just show you a few.
p63
aVThis is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility
p64
aVat Hanford site in Washington State,
p65
aVwhere there are over 1,900
p66
aVstainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste
p67
aVsubmerged in water.
p68
aVA human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly.
p69
aVAnd I found one section amongst all of these
p70
aVthat actually resembled the outline
p71
aVof the United States of America,
p72
aVwhich you can see here.
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd a big part of the work that is
p75
aVsort of absent in this context is text.
p76
aVSo I create these two poles.
p77
aVEvery image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text.
p78
aVAnd what I'm most interested in
p79
aVis the invisible space between a text
p80
aVand its accompanying image,
p81
aVand how the image is transformed by the text
p82
aVand the text by the image.
p83
aVSo, at best, the image is meant to float away
p84
aVinto abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy.
p85
aVAnd then the text functions as this cruel anchor
p86
aVthat kind of nails it to the ground.
p87
aVBut in this context I'm just going to read
p88
aVan abridged version of those texts.
p89
aa(lp90
VThis is a cryopreservation unit,
p91
aVand it holds the bodies of the wife and mother
p92
aVof cryonics pioneer Robert Ettinger,
p93
aVwho hoped to be awoken one day to extended life
p94
aVin good health, with advancements in science and technology,
p95
aVall for the cost of 35 thousand dollars, for forever.
p96
aa(lp97
VThis is a 21-year-old Palestinian woman
p98
aVundergoing hymenoplasty.
p99
aVHymenoplasty is a surgical procedure which restores the virginal state,
p100
aVallowing her to adhere to certain cultural expectations
p101
aVregarding virginity and marriage.
p102
aVSo it essentially reconstructs a ruptured hymen,
p103
aVallowing her to bleed upon having sexual intercourse,
p104
aVto simulate the loss of virginity.
p105
aa(lp106
VThis is a jury simulation deliberation room,
p107
aVand you can see beyond that two-way mirror
p108
aVjury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror.
p109
aVAnd they observe deliberations
p110
aVafter mock trial proceedings
p111
aVso that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy
p112
aVto have the outcome that they're hoping for.
p113
aVThis process costs 60,000 dollars.
p114
aa(lp115
VThis is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection room,
p116
aVa contraband room, at John F. Kennedy International Airport.
p117
aVOn that table you can see 48 hours' worth
p118
aVof seized goods from passengers entering in to the United States.
p119
aVThere is a pig's head and African cane rats.
p120
aVAnd part of my photographic work
p121
aVis I'm not just documenting what's there.
p122
aVI do take certain liberties and intervene.
p123
aVAnd in this I really wanted it to resemble
p124
aVan early still-life painting,
p125
aVso I spent some time with the smells and items.
p126
aa(lp127
VThis is the exhibited art on the walls of the CIA
p128
aVin Langley, Virginia, their original headquarters building.
p129
aVAnd the CIA has had a long history
p130
aVwith both covert and public cultural diplomacy efforts.
p131
aVAnd it's speculated that some of their interest in the arts
p132
aVwas designed to counter Soviet communism
p133
aVand promote what it considered to be pro-American
p134
aVthoughts and aesthetics.
p135
aVAnd one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency,
p136
aVand had thus come under question, is abstract expressionism.
p137
aa(lp138
VThis is the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility,
p139
aVand on a six acre plot
p140
aVthere are approximately 75 cadavers at any given time
p141
aVthat are being studied by forensic anthropologists
p142
aVand researchers who are interested in monitoring
p143
aVa rate of corpse decomposition.
p144
aVAnd in this particular photograph the body of a young boy
p145
aVhas been used to reenact a crime scene.
p146
aa(lp147
VThis is the only federally funded site
p148
aVwhere it is legal to cultivate cannabis
p149
aVfor scientific research in the United States.
p150
aVIt's a research crop marijuana grow room.
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd part of the work that I hope for
p153
aVis that there is a sort of disorienting entropy
p154
aVwhere you can't find any discernible formula in how these things \u2014
p155
aVthey sort of awkwardly jump from government to science
p156
aVto religion to security \u2014
p157
aVand you can't completely understand
p158
aVhow information is being distributed.
p159
aa(lp160
VThese are transatlantic submarine communication cables
p161
aVthat travel across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean,
p162
aVconnecting North America to Europe.
p163
aVThey carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations,
p164
aVand in a lot of the government and technology sites
p165
aVthere was just this very apparent vulnerability.
p166
aVThis one is almost humorous because it feels like I could
p167
aVjust snip all of that conversation in one easy cut.
p168
aVBut stuff did feel like it could have been taken
p169
aV30 or 40 years ago, like it was locked in the Cold War era
p170
aVand hadn't necessarily progressed.
p171
aa(lp172
VThis is a Braille edition of Playboy magazine.
p173
aV(Laughter)
p174
aVAnd this is ... a division of the Library of Congress
p175
aVproduces a free national library service
p176
aVfor the blind and visually impaired,
p177
aVand the publications they choose to publish
p178
aVare based on reader popularity.
p179
aVAnd Playboy is always in the top few.
p180
aV(Laughter)
p181
aVBut you'd be surprised, they don't do the photographs. It's just the text.
p182
aV(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VThis is an avian quarantine facility
p185
aVwhere all imported birds coming into America
p186
aVare required to undergo a 30-day quarantine,
p187
aVwhere they are tested for diseases
p188
aVincluding Exotic Newcastle Disease
p189
aVand Avian Influenza.
p190
aVThis film shows
p191
aVthe testing of a new explosive fill on a warhead.
p192
aVAnd the Air Armament Center
p193
aVat Eglin Air Force Base in Florida
p194
aVis responsible for the deployment and testing
p195
aVof all air-delivered weaponry
p196
aVcoming from the United States.
p197
aVAnd the film was shot on 72 millimeter, government-issue film.
p198
aVAnd that red dot is a marking on the government-issue film.
p199
aa(lp200
VAll living white tigers in North America
p201
aVare the result of selective inbreeding \u2014
p202
aVthat would be mother to son,
p203
aVfather to daughter, sister to brother \u2014
p204
aVto allow for the genetic conditions
p205
aVthat create a salable white tiger.
p206
aVMeaning white fur, ice blue eyes, a pink nose.
p207
aVAnd the majority of these white tigers
p208
aVare not born in a salable state
p209
aVand are killed at birth.
p210
aVIt's a very violent process that is little known.
p211
aVAnd the white tiger is obviously celebrated in several forms of entertainment.
p212
aVKenny was born. He actually made it to adulthood.
p213
aVHe has since passed away,
p214
aVbut was mentally retarded
p215
aVand suffers from severe bone abnormalities.
p216
aa(lp217
VThis, on a lighter note, is at
p218
aVGeorge Lucas' personal archive.
p219
aVThis is the Death Star.
p220
aVAnd it's shown here in its true orientation.
p221
aVIn the context of "Star Wars: Return of the Jedi,"
p222
aVits mirror image is presented.
p223
aVThey flip the negative.
p224
aVAnd you can see the photoetched brass detailing,
p225
aVand the painted acrylic facade.
p226
aVIn the context of the film,
p227
aVthis is a deep-space battle station of the Galactic Empire,
p228
aVcapable of annihilating planets and civilizations,
p229
aVand in reality it measures about four feet by two feet.
p230
aV(Laughter)
p231
aa(lp232
VThis is at Fort Campbell in Kentucky.
p233
aVIt's a Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain site.
p234
aVEssentially they've simulated a city
p235
aVfor urban combat,
p236
aVand this is one of the structures that exists in that city.
p237
aVIt's called the World Church of God.
p238
aVIt's supposed to be a generic site of worship.
p239
aVAnd after I took this photograph,
p240
aVthey constructed a wall around the World Church of God
p241
aVto mimic the set-up of mosques in Afghanistan or Iraq.
p242
aVAnd I worked with Mehta Vihar
p243
aVwho creates virtual simulations for the army
p244
aVfor tactical practice.
p245
aVAnd we put that wall around the World Church of God,
p246
aVand also used the characters and vehicles and explosions
p247
aVthat are offered in the video games for the army.
p248
aVAnd I put them into my photograph.
p249
aa(lp250
VThis is live HIV virus
p251
aVat Harvard Medical School, who is working with the U.S. Government
p252
aVto develop sterilizing immunity.
p253
aa(lp254
VAnd Alhurra is a U.S. Government- sponsored
p255
aVArabic language television network
p256
aVthat distributes news and information to over 22 countries in the Arab world.
p257
aVIt runs 24 hours a day, commercial free.
p258
aVHowever, it's illegal to broadcast Alhurra within the United States.
p259
aVAnd in 2004, they developed a channel called Alhurra Iraq,
p260
aVwhich specifically deals with events occurring in Iraq
p261
aVand is broadcast to Iraq.
p262
aa(lp263
VNow I'm going to move on to another project I did.
p264
aVIt's titled "The Innocents."
p265
aVAnd for the men in these photographs,
p266
aVphotography had been used to create a fantasy.
p267
aVContradicting its function as evidence of a truth,
p268
aVin these instances it furthered the fabrication of a lie.
p269
aVI traveled across the United States
p270
aVphotographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted
p271
aVof crimes they did not commit, violent crimes.
p272
aa(lp273
VI investigate photography's ability to blur truth and fiction,
p274
aVand its influence on memory,
p275
aVwhich can lead to severe, even lethal consequences.
p276
aVFor the men in these photographs,
p277
aVthe primary cause of their wrongful conviction
p278
aVwas mistaken identification.
p279
aVA victim or eyewitness identifies
p280
aVa suspected perpetrator
p281
aVthrough law enforcement's use of images.
p282
aVBut through exposure to composite sketches,
p283
aVPolaroids, mug shots and line-ups,
p284
aVeyewitness testimony can change.
p285
aa(lp286
VI'll give you an example from a case.
p287
aVA woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs
p288
aVfrom which to identify her attacker.
p289
aVShe saw some similarities in one of the photographs,
p290
aVbut couldn't quite make a positive identification.
p291
aVDays later, she is presented with another photo array
p292
aVof all new photographs,
p293
aVexcept that one photograph that she had some draw to
p294
aVfrom the earlier array is repeated in the second array.
p295
aVAnd a positive identification is made
p296
aVbecause the photograph replaced the memory,
p297
aVif there ever was an actual memory.
p298
aa(lp299
VPhotography offered the criminal justice system
p300
aVa tool that transformed innocent citizens into criminals,
p301
aVand the criminal justice system failed to recognize the limitations
p302
aVof relying on photographic identifications.
p303
aa(lp304
VFrederick Daye, who is photographed at his alibi location,
p305
aVwhere 13 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime.
p306
aVHe was convicted by an all-white jury
p307
aVof rape, kidnapping and vehicle theft.
p308
aVAnd he served 10 years of a life sentence.
p309
aVNow DNA exonerated Frederick
p310
aVand it also implicated another man
p311
aVwho was serving time in prison.
p312
aVBut the victim refused to press charges
p313
aVbecause she claimed that law enforcement
p314
aVhad permanently altered her memory through the use of Frederick's photograph.
p315
aa(lp316
VCharles Fain was convicted of kidnapping, rape and murder
p317
aVof a young girl walking to school.
p318
aVHe served 18 years of a death sentence.
p319
aVI photographed him at the scene of the crime
p320
aVat the Snake River in Idaho.
p321
aVAnd I photographed all of the wrongfully convicted
p322
aVat sites that came to particular significance
p323
aVin the history of their wrongful conviction.
p324
aVThe scene of arrest, the scene of misidentification,
p325
aVthe alibi location.
p326
aVAnd here, the scene of the crime, it's this place
p327
aVto which he's never been, but changed his life forever.
p328
aVSo photographing there, I was hoping to highlight
p329
aVthe tenuous relationship between truth and fiction,
p330
aVin both his life and in photography.
p331
aa(lp332
VCalvin Washington was convicted of capital murder.
p333
aVHe served 13 years of a life sentence in Waco, Texas.
p334
aa(lp335
VLarry Mayes, I photographed at the scene of arrest,
p336
aVwhere he hid between two mattresses in Gary, Indiana,
p337
aVin this very room to hide from the police.
p338
aVHe ended up serving 18 and a half years
p339
aVof an 80 year sentence for rape and robbery.
p340
aVThe victim failed to identify Larry
p341
aVin two live lineups
p342
aVand then made a positive identification, days later,
p343
aVfrom a photo array.
p344
aa(lp345
VLarry Youngblood served eight years of a 10 and half year sentence
p346
aVin Arizona for the abduction and repeated sodomizing
p347
aVof a 10 year old boy at a carnival.
p348
aVHe is photographed at his alibi location.
p349
aa(lp350
VRon Williamson. Ron was convicted of the rape and murder
p351
aVof a barmaid at a club,
p352
aVand served 11 years of a death sentence.
p353
aVI photographed Ron at a baseball field
p354
aVbecause he had been drafted to the Oakland A's
p355
aVto play professional baseball just before his conviction.
p356
aVAnd the state's key witness in Ron's case
p357
aVwas, in the end, the actual perpetrator.
p358
aa(lp359
VRonald Jones served eight years of a death sentence
p360
aVfor rape and murder of a 28-year-old woman.
p361
aVI photographed him at the scene of arrest in Chicago.
p362
aa(lp363
VWilliam Gregory was convicted of rape and burglary.
p364
aVHe served seven years of a 70 year sentence in Kentucky.
p365
aa(lp366
VTimothy Durham, who I photographed at his alibi location
p367
aVwhere 11 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime,
p368
aVwas convicted of 3.5 years
p369
aVof a 3220 year sentence,
p370
aVfor several charges of rape and robbery.
p371
aVHe had been misidentified by an 11-year-old victim.
p372
aa(lp373
VTroy Webb is photographed here at the scene of the crime in Virginia.
p374
aVHe was convicted of rape, kidnapping and robbery,
p375
aVand served seven years of a 47 year sentence.
p376
aVTroy's picture was in a photo array
p377
aVthat the victim tentatively had some draw toward,
p378
aVbut said he looked too old.
p379
aVThe police went and found a photograph of Troy Webb
p380
aVfrom four years earlier,
p381
aVwhich they entered into a photo array days later,
p382
aVand he was positively identified.
p383
aa(lp384
VNow I'm going to leave you with a self portrait.
p385
aVAnd it reiterates that distortion is a constant,
p386
aVand our eyes are easily deceived.
p387
aVThat's it. Thank you.
p388
aV(Applause)

VFirst, a video.
p5
aVYes, it is a scrambled egg.
p6
aVBut as you look at it,
p7
aVI hope you'll begin to feel just slightly uneasy.
p8
aVBecause you may notice that what's actually happening
p9
aVis that the egg is unscrambling itself.
p10
aVAnd you'll now see the yolk and the white have separated.
p11
aVAnd now they're going to be poured back into the egg.
p12
aVAnd we all know in our heart of hearts
p13
aVthat this is not the way the universe works.
p14
aVA scrambled egg is mush \u2014 tasty mush \u2014 but it's mush.
p15
aVAn egg is a beautiful, sophisticated thing
p16
aVthat can create even more sophisticated things,
p17
aVsuch as chickens.
p18
aVAnd we know in our heart of hearts
p19
aVthat the universe does not travel from mush to complexity.
p20
aVIn fact, this gut instinct
p21
aVis reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics,
p22
aVthe second law of thermodynamics, or the law of entropy.
p23
aVWhat that says basically
p24
aVis that the general tendency of the universe
p25
aVis to move from order and structure
p26
aVto lack of order, lack of structure \u2014
p27
aVin fact, to mush.
p28
aVAnd that's why that video feels a bit strange.
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd yet, look around us.
p31
aVWhat we see around us is staggering complexity.
p32
aVEric Beinhocker estimates that in New York City alone,
p33
aVthere are some 10 billion SKUs, or distinct commodities, being traded.
p34
aVThat's hundreds of times as many species as there are on Earth.
p35
aVAnd they're being traded by a species of almost seven billion individuals,
p36
aVwho are linked by trade, travel, and the Internet
p37
aVinto a global system of stupendous complexity.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo here's a great puzzle:
p40
aVin a universe ruled by the second law of thermodynamics,
p41
aVhow is it possible
p42
aVto generate the sort of complexity I've described,
p43
aVthe sort of complexity represented by you and me
p44
aVand the convention center?
p45
aVWell, the answer seems to be,
p46
aVthe universe can create complexity,
p47
aVbut with great difficulty.
p48
aVIn pockets,
p49
aVthere appear what my colleague, Fred Spier,
p50
aVcalls "Goldilocks conditions" \u2014
p51
aVnot too hot, not too cold,
p52
aVjust right for the creation of complexity.
p53
aVAnd slightly more complex things appear.
p54
aVAnd where you have slightly more complex things,
p55
aVyou can get slightly more complex things.
p56
aVAnd in this way, complexity builds stage by stage.
p57
aVEach stage is magical
p58
aVbecause it creates the impression of something utterly new
p59
aVappearing almost out of nowhere in the universe.
p60
aVWe refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments.
p61
aVAnd at each threshold, the going gets tougher.
p62
aVThe complex things get more fragile,
p63
aVmore vulnerable;
p64
aVthe Goldilocks conditions get more stringent,
p65
aVand it's more difficult to create complexity.
p66
aa(lp67
VNow, we, as extremely complex creatures,
p68
aVdesperately need to know this story
p69
aVof how the universe creates complexity despite the second law,
p70
aVand why complexity means vulnerability and fragility.
p71
aVAnd that's the story that we tell in big history.
p72
aVBut to do it, you have do something
p73
aVthat may, at first sight, seem completely impossible.
p74
aVYou have to survey the whole history of the universe.
p75
aVSo let's do it.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VLet's begin by winding the timeline back
p80
aV13.7 billion years,
p81
aVto the beginning of time.
p82
aa(lp83
VAround us, there's nothing.
p84
aVThere's not even time or space.
p85
aVImagine the darkest, emptiest thing you can
p86
aVand cube it a gazillion times and that's where we are.
p87
aVAnd then suddenly,
p88
aVbang!
p89
aVA universe appears, an entire universe.
p90
aVAnd we've crossed our first threshold.
p91
aVThe universe is tiny; it's smaller than an atom.
p92
aVIt's incredibly hot.
p93
aVIt contains everything that's in today's universe,
p94
aVso you can imagine, it's busting.
p95
aVAnd it's expanding at incredible speed.
p96
aVAnd at first, it's just a blur,
p97
aVbut very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur.
p98
aVWithin the first second,
p99
aVenergy itself shatters into distinct forces
p100
aVincluding electromagnetism and gravity.
p101
aVAnd energy does something else quite magical:
p102
aVit congeals to form matter \u2014
p103
aVquarks that will create protons
p104
aVand leptons that include electrons.
p105
aVAnd all of that happens in the first second.
p106
aa(lp107
VNow we move forward 380,000 years.
p108
aVThat's twice as long as humans have been on this planet.
p109
aVAnd now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium.
p110
aVNow I want to pause for a moment,
p111
aV380,000 years after the origins of the universe,
p112
aVbecause we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage.
p113
aVWe know above all that it was extremely simple.
p114
aVIt consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms,
p115
aVand they have no structure.
p116
aVThey're really a sort of cosmic mush.
p117
aVBut that's not completely true.
p118
aVRecent studies
p119
aVby satellites such as the WMAP satellite
p120
aVhave shown that, in fact,
p121
aVthere are just tiny differences in that background.
p122
aVWhat you see here,
p123
aVthe blue areas are about a thousandth of a degree cooler
p124
aVthan the red areas.
p125
aVThese are tiny differences,
p126
aVbut it was enough for the universe to move on
p127
aVto the next stage of building complexity.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd this is how it works.
p130
aVGravity is more powerful where there's more stuff.
p131
aVSo where you get slightly denser areas,
p132
aVgravity starts compacting clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms.
p133
aVSo we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion clouds.
p134
aVAnd each cloud is compacted,
p135
aVgravity gets more powerful as density increases,
p136
aVthe temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud,
p137
aVand then, at the center,
p138
aVthe temperature crosses the threshold temperature
p139
aVof 10 million degrees,
p140
aVprotons start to fuse,
p141
aVthere's a huge release of energy,
p142
aVand \u2014
p143
aVbam!
p144
aVWe have our first stars.
p145
aVFrom about 200 million years after the Big Bang,
p146
aVstars begin to appear all through the universe,
p147
aVbillions of them.
p148
aVAnd the universe is now significantly more interesting
p149
aVand more complex.
p150
aa(lp151
VStars will create the Goldilocks conditions
p152
aVfor crossing two new thresholds.
p153
aVWhen very large stars die,
p154
aVthey create temperatures so high
p155
aVthat protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations,
p156
aVto form all the elements of the periodic table.
p157
aVIf, like me, you're wearing a gold ring,
p158
aVit was forged in a supernova explosion.
p159
aVSo now the universe is chemically more complex.
p160
aVAnd in a chemically more complex universe,
p161
aVit's possible to make more things.
p162
aVAnd what starts happening is that, around young suns,
p163
aVyoung stars,
p164
aVall these elements combine, they swirl around,
p165
aVthe energy of the star stirs them around,
p166
aVthey form particles, they form snowflakes, they form little dust motes,
p167
aVthey form rocks, they form asteroids,
p168
aVand eventually, they form planets and moons.
p169
aVAnd that is how our solar system was formed,
p170
aVfour and a half billion years ago.
p171
aVRocky planets like our Earth are significantly more complex than stars
p172
aVbecause they contain a much greater diversity of materials.
p173
aVSo we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity.
p174
aa(lp175
VNow, the going gets tougher.
p176
aVThe next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile,
p177
aVsignificantly more vulnerable,
p178
aVbut they're also much more creative
p179
aVand much more capable of generating further complexity.
p180
aVI'm talking, of course, about living organisms.
p181
aVLiving organisms are created by chemistry.
p182
aVWe are huge packages of chemicals.
p183
aVSo, chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force.
p184
aVThat operates over smaller scales than gravity,
p185
aVwhich explains why you and I are smaller than stars or planets.
p186
aVNow, what are the ideal conditions for chemistry?
p187
aVWhat are the Goldilocks conditions?
p188
aVWell, first, you need energy,
p189
aVbut not too much.
p190
aVIn the center of a star, there's so much energy
p191
aVthat any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again.
p192
aVBut not too little.
p193
aVIn intergalactic space,
p194
aVthere's so little energy that atoms can't combine.
p195
aVWhat you want is just the right amount,
p196
aVand planets, it turns out, are just right,
p197
aVbecause they're close to stars, but not too close.
p198
aa(lp199
VYou also need a great diversity of chemical elements,
p200
aVand you need liquids, such as water.
p201
aVWhy?
p202
aVWell, in gases, atoms move past each other so fast
p203
aVthat they can't hitch up.
p204
aVIn solids,
p205
aVatoms are stuck together, they can't move.
p206
aVIn liquids,
p207
aVthey can cruise and cuddle
p208
aVand link up to form molecules.
p209
aVNow, where do you find such Goldilocks conditions?
p210
aVWell, planets are great,
p211
aVand our early Earth was almost perfect.
p212
aVIt was just the right distance from its star
p213
aVto contain huge oceans of liquid water.
p214
aVAnd deep beneath those oceans,
p215
aVat cracks in the Earth's crust,
p216
aVyou've got heat seeping up from inside the Earth,
p217
aVand you've got a great diversity of elements.
p218
aVSo at those deep oceanic vents,
p219
aVfantastic chemistry began to happen,
p220
aVand atoms combined in all sorts of exotic combinations.
p221
aa(lp222
VBut of course, life is more than just exotic chemistry.
p223
aVHow do you stabilize those huge molecules
p224
aVthat seem to be viable?
p225
aVWell, it's here that life introduces an entirely new trick.
p226
aVYou don't stabilize the individual;
p227
aVyou stabilize the template,
p228
aVthe thing that carries information,
p229
aVand you allow the template to copy itself.
p230
aVAnd DNA, of course, is the beautiful molecule
p231
aVthat contains that information.
p232
aVYou'll be familiar with the double helix of DNA.
p233
aVEach rung contains information.
p234
aVSo, DNA contains information about how to make living organisms.
p235
aVAnd DNA also copies itself.
p236
aVSo, it copies itself
p237
aVand scatters the templates through the ocean.
p238
aVSo the information spreads.
p239
aVNotice that information has become part of our story.
p240
aVThe real beauty of DNA though is in its imperfections.
p241
aVAs it copies itself, once in every billion rungs,
p242
aVthere tends to be an error.
p243
aVAnd what that means is that DNA is, in effect, learning.
p244
aVIt's accumulating new ways of making living organisms
p245
aVbecause some of those errors work.
p246
aVSo DNA's learning
p247
aVand it's building greater diversity and greater complexity.
p248
aVAnd we can see this happening over the last four billion years.
p249
aa(lp250
VFor most of that time of life on Earth,
p251
aVliving organisms have been relatively simple \u2014
p252
aVsingle cells.
p253
aVBut they had great diversity, and, inside, great complexity.
p254
aVThen from about 600 to 800 million years ago,
p255
aVmulti-celled organisms appear.
p256
aVYou get fungi, you get fish,
p257
aVyou get plants,
p258
aVyou get amphibia, you get reptiles,
p259
aVand then, of course, you get the dinosaurs.
p260
aVAnd occasionally, there are disasters.
p261
aVSixty-five million years ago,
p262
aVan asteroid landed on Earth
p263
aVnear the Yucatan Peninsula,
p264
aVcreating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear war,
p265
aVand the dinosaurs were wiped out.
p266
aVTerrible news for the dinosaurs,
p267
aVbut great news for our mammalian ancestors,
p268
aVwho flourished
p269
aVin the niches left empty by the dinosaurs.
p270
aVAnd we human beings are part of that creative evolutionary pulse
p271
aVthat began 65 million years ago
p272
aVwith the landing of an asteroid.
p273
aa(lp274
VHumans appeared about 200,000 years ago.
p275
aVAnd I believe we count as a threshold in this great story.
p276
aVLet me explain why.
p277
aVWe've seen that DNA learns in a sense,
p278
aVit accumulates information.
p279
aVBut it is so slow.
p280
aVDNA accumulates information through random errors,
p281
aVsome of which just happen to work.
p282
aVBut DNA had actually generated a faster way of learning:
p283
aVit had produced organisms with brains,
p284
aVand those organisms can learn in real time.
p285
aVThey accumulate information, they learn.
p286
aVThe sad thing is, when they die,
p287
aVthe information dies with them.
p288
aVNow what makes humans different is human language.
p289
aVWe are blessed with a language, a system of communication,
p290
aVso powerful and so precise
p291
aVthat we can share what we've learned with such precision
p292
aVthat it can accumulate in the collective memory.
p293
aVAnd that means
p294
aVit can outlast the individuals who learned that information,
p295
aVand it can accumulate from generation to generation.
p296
aVAnd that's why, as a species, we're so creative and so powerful,
p297
aVand that's why we have a history.
p298
aVWe seem to be the only species in four billion years
p299
aVto have this gift.
p300
aa(lp301
VI call this ability collective learning.
p302
aVIt's what makes us different.
p303
aVWe can see it at work in the earliest stages of human history.
p304
aVWe evolved as a species in the savanna lands of Africa,
p305
aVbut then you see humans migrating into new environments,
p306
aVinto desert lands, into jungles,
p307
aVinto the Ice Age tundra of Siberia \u2014
p308
aVtough, tough environment \u2014
p309
aVinto the Americas, into Australasia.
p310
aVEach migration involved learning \u2014
p311
aVlearning new ways of exploiting the environment,
p312
aVnew ways of dealing with their surroundings.
p313
aa(lp314
VThen 10,000 years ago,
p315
aVexploiting a sudden change in global climate
p316
aVwith the end of the last ice age,
p317
aVhumans learned to farm.
p318
aVFarming was an energy bonanza.
p319
aVAnd exploiting that energy, human populations multiplied.
p320
aVHuman societies got larger, denser, more interconnected.
p321
aVAnd then from about 500 years ago,
p322
aVhumans began to link up globally
p323
aVthrough shipping, through trains,
p324
aVthrough telegraph, through the Internet,
p325
aVuntil now we seem to form a single global brain
p326
aVof almost seven billion individuals.
p327
aVAnd that brain is learning at warp speed.
p328
aVAnd in the last 200 years, something else has happened.
p329
aVWe've stumbled on another energy bonanza
p330
aVin fossil fuels.
p331
aVSo fossil fuels and collective learning together
p332
aVexplain the staggering complexity we see around us.
p333
aa(lp334
VSo \u2014
p335
aVHere we are,
p336
aVback at the convention center.
p337
aVWe've been on a journey, a return journey, of 13.7 billion years.
p338
aVI hope you agree this is a powerful story.
p339
aVAnd it's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role.
p340
aVBut it also contains warnings.
p341
aVCollective learning is a very, very powerful force,
p342
aVand it's not clear that we humans are in charge of it.
p343
aVI remember very vividly as a child growing up in England,
p344
aVliving through the Cuban Missile Crisis.
p345
aVFor a few days, the entire biosphere
p346
aVseemed to be on the verge of destruction.
p347
aVAnd the same weapons are still here,
p348
aVand they are still armed.
p349
aVIf we avoid that trap, others are waiting for us.
p350
aVWe're burning fossil fuels at such a rate
p351
aVthat we seem to be undermining the Goldilocks conditions
p352
aVthat made it possible for human civilizations
p353
aVto flourish over the last 10,000 years.
p354
aVSo what big history can do
p355
aVis show us the nature of our complexity and fragility
p356
aVand the dangers that face us,
p357
aVbut it can also show us our power with collective learning.
p358
aa(lp359
VAnd now, finally \u2014
p360
aVthis is what I want.
p361
aVI want my grandson, Daniel,
p362
aVand his friends and his generation,
p363
aVthroughout the world,
p364
aVto know the story of big history,
p365
aVand to know it so well
p366
aVthat they understand both the challenges that face us
p367
aVand the opportunities that face us.
p368
aVAnd that's why a group of us
p369
aVare building a free, online syllabus
p370
aVin big history
p371
aVfor high-school students throughout the world.
p372
aVWe believe that big history
p373
aVwill be a vital intellectual tool for them,
p374
aVas Daniel and his generation
p375
aVface the huge challenges
p376
aVand also the huge opportunities
p377
aVahead of them at this threshold moment
p378
aVin the history of our beautiful planet.
p379
aa(lp380
VI thank you for your attention.

VYou should be nice
p5
aVto nerds.
p6
aVIn fact, I'd go so far as to say,
p7
aVif you don't already have a nerd in your life,
p8
aVyou should get one.
p9
aVI'm just saying.
p10
aVScientists and engineers
p11
aVchange the world.
p12
aVI'd like to tell you
p13
aVabout a magical place called DARPA
p14
aVwhere scientists and engineers
p15
aVdefy the impossible
p16
aVand refuse to fear failure.
p17
aVNow these two ideas
p18
aVare connected more than you may realize,
p19
aVbecause when you remove the fear of failure,
p20
aVimpossible things
p21
aVsuddenly become possible.
p22
aa(lp23
VIf you want to know how,
p24
aVask yourself this question:
p25
aVWhat would you attempt to do
p26
aVif you knew you could not fail?
p27
aVIf you really ask yourself
p28
aVthis question,
p29
aVyou can't help but feel uncomfortable.
p30
aVI feel a little uncomfortable.
p31
aVBecause when you ask it,
p32
aVyou begin to understand
p33
aVhow the fear of failure constrains you,
p34
aVhow it keeps us
p35
aVfrom attempting great things,
p36
aVand life gets dull,
p37
aVamazing things stop happening.
p38
aVSure, good things happen,
p39
aVbut amazing things
p40
aVstop happening.
p41
aa(lp42
VNow I should be clear,
p43
aVI'm not encouraging failure,
p44
aVI'm discouraging
p45
aVfear of failure.
p46
aVBecause it's not failure itself
p47
aVthat constrains us.
p48
aVThe path to truly new,
p49
aVnever-been-done-before things
p50
aValways has failure along the way.
p51
aVWe're tested.
p52
aVAnd in part, that testing feels an appropriate part
p53
aVof achieving something great.
p54
aVClemenceau said,
p55
aV"Life gets interesting when we fail,
p56
aVbecause it's a sign
p57
aVthat we've surpassed ourselves."
p58
aa(lp59
VIn 1895,
p60
aVLord Kelvin declared
p61
aVthat heavier-than-air flying machines
p62
aVwere impossible.
p63
aVIn October of 1903,
p64
aVthe prevailing opinion
p65
aVof expert aerodynamicists
p66
aVwas that maybe in 10 million years
p67
aVwe could build an aircraft that would fly.
p68
aVAnd two months later on December 17th,
p69
aVOrville Wright powered the first airplane
p70
aVacross a beach in North Carolina.
p71
aVThe flight lasted 12 seconds
p72
aVand covered 120 feet.
p73
aVThat was 1903.
p74
aa(lp75
VOne year later,
p76
aVthe next declarations of impossibilities began.
p77
aVFerdinand Foch, a French army general
p78
aVcredited with having one of the most original and subtle minds
p79
aVin the French army,
p80
aVsaid, "Airplanes are interesting toys,
p81
aVbut of no military value."
p82
aV40 years later,
p83
aVaero experts coined the term transonic.
p84
aVThey debated, should it have one S or two?
p85
aVYou see, they were having trouble in this flight regime,
p86
aVand it wasn't at all clear
p87
aVthat we could fly faster than the speed of sound.
p88
aVIn 1947,
p89
aVthere was no wind tunnel data
p90
aVbeyond Mach 0.85.
p91
aVAnd yet,
p92
aVon Tuesday, October 14th, 1947,
p93
aVChuck Yeager climbed into the cockpit
p94
aVof his Bell X-1
p95
aVand he flew
p96
aVtowards an unknown possibility,
p97
aVand in so doing,
p98
aVhe became the first pilot
p99
aVto fly faster than the speed of sound.
p100
aVSix of eight Atlas rockets
p101
aVblew up on the pad.
p102
aVAfter 11 complete mission failures,
p103
aVwe got our first images from space.
p104
aVAnd on that first flight
p105
aVwe got more data
p106
aVthan in all U-2 missions combined.
p107
aVIt took a lot of failures
p108
aVto get there.
p109
aa(lp110
VSince we took to the sky,
p111
aVwe have wanted to fly
p112
aVfaster and farther.
p113
aVAnd to do so,
p114
aVwe've had to believe in impossible things.
p115
aVAnd we've had to refuse
p116
aVto fear failure.
p117
aVThat's still true today.
p118
aVToday, we don't talk about flying transonically,
p119
aVor even supersonically,
p120
aVwe talk about flying hypersonically \u2014
p121
aVnot Mach 2 or Mach 3, Mach 20.
p122
aVAt Mach 20,
p123
aVwe can fly from New York to Long Beach
p124
aVin 11 minutes and 20 seconds.
p125
aVAt that speed,
p126
aVthe surface of the airfoil
p127
aVis the temperature of molten steel \u2014
p128
aV3,500 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014
p129
aVlike a blast furnace.
p130
aVWe are essentially burning the airfoil
p131
aVas we fly it.
p132
aVAnd we are flying it,
p133
aVor trying to.
p134
aa(lp135
VDARPA's hypersonic test vehicle
p136
aVis the fastest maneuvering aircraft
p137
aVever built.
p138
aVIt's boosted to near-space
p139
aVatop a Minotaur IV rocket.
p140
aVNow the Minotaur IV has too much impulse,
p141
aVso we have to bleed it off
p142
aVby flying the rocket
p143
aVat an 89 degree angle of attack
p144
aVfor portions of the trajectory.
p145
aVThat's an unnatural act
p146
aVfor a rocket.
p147
aVThe third stage has a camera.
p148
aVWe call it rocketcam.
p149
aVAnd it's pointed
p150
aVat the hypersonic glider.
p151
aVThis is the actual rocketcam footage
p152
aVfrom flight one.
p153
aVNow to conceal the shape, we changed the aspect ratio a little bit.
p154
aVBut this is what it looks like
p155
aVfrom the third stage of the rocket
p156
aVlooking at the unmanned glider
p157
aVas it heads into the atmosphere
p158
aVback towards Earth.
p159
aa(lp160
VWe've flown twice.
p161
aVIn the first flight,
p162
aVno aerodynamic control of the vehicle.
p163
aVBut we collected more hypersonic flight data
p164
aVthan in 30 years
p165
aVof ground-based testing combined.
p166
aVAnd in the second flight,
p167
aVthree minutes of fully-controlled,
p168
aVaerodynamic flight
p169
aVat Mach 20.
p170
aVWe must fly again,
p171
aVbecause amazing, never-been-done-before things
p172
aVrequire that you fly.
p173
aVYou can't learn to fly at Mach 20
p174
aVunless you fly.
p175
aVAnd while there's no substitute for speed,
p176
aVmaneuverability is a very close second.
p177
aa(lp178
VIf a Mach 20 glider takes 11 minutes and 20 seconds
p179
aVto get from New York to Long Beach,
p180
aVa hummingbird would take,
p181
aVwell, days.
p182
aVYou see, hummingbirds are not hypersonic,
p183
aVbut they are maneuverable.
p184
aVIn fact, the hummingbird is the only bird
p185
aVthat can fly backwards.
p186
aVIt can fly up, down,
p187
aVforwards, backwards,
p188
aVeven upside-down.
p189
aVAnd so if we wanted to fly in this room
p190
aVor places where humans can't go,
p191
aVwe'd need an aircraft
p192
aVsmall enough and maneuverable enough
p193
aVto do so.
p194
aa(lp195
VThis is a hummingbird drone.
p196
aVIt can fly in all directions,
p197
aVeven backwards.
p198
aVIt can hover and rotate.
p199
aVThis prototype aircraft
p200
aVis equipped with a video camera.
p201
aVIt weighs less than one AA battery.
p202
aVIt does not eat nectar.
p203
aVIn 2008,
p204
aVit flew for a whopping 20 seconds,
p205
aVa year later, two minutes,
p206
aVthen six,
p207
aVeventually 11.
p208
aVMany prototypes crashed \u2014 many.
p209
aVBut there's no way
p210
aVto learn to fly like a hummingbird
p211
aVunless you fly.
p212
aV(Applause)
p213
aVIt's beautiful, isn't it.
p214
aVWow.
p215
aVIt's great.
p216
aVMatt is the first ever hummingbird pilot.
p217
aV(Applause)
p218
aa(lp219
VFailure is part of creating
p220
aVnew and amazing things.
p221
aVWe cannot both fear failure
p222
aVand make amazing new things \u2014
p223
aVlike a robot
p224
aVwith the stability of a dog on rough terrain,
p225
aVor maybe even ice;
p226
aVa robot that can run like a cheetah,
p227
aVor climb stairs like a human
p228
aVwith the occasional clumsiness of a human.
p229
aVOr perhaps, Spider Man
p230
aVwill one day be Gecko Man.
p231
aVA gecko can support
p232
aVits entire body weight
p233
aVwith one toe.
p234
aVOne square millimeter of a gecko's footpad
p235
aVhas 14,000 hair-like structures
p236
aVcalled setae.
p237
aVThey are used to help it grip to surfaces
p238
aVusing intermolecular forces.
p239
aa(lp240
VToday we can manufacture structures
p241
aVthat mimic the hairs of a gecko's foot.
p242
aVThe result,
p243
aVa four-by-four-inch
p244
aVartificial nano-gecko adhesive.
p245
aVcan support a static load
p246
aVof 660 pounds.
p247
aVThat's enough to stick
p248
aVsix 42-inch plasma TV's to your wall,
p249
aVno nails.
p250
aVSo much for Velcro, right?
p251
aa(lp252
VAnd it's not just passive structures,
p253
aVit's entire machines.
p254
aVThis is a spider mite.
p255
aVIt's one millimeter long,
p256
aVbut it looks like Godzilla
p257
aVnext to these micromachines.
p258
aVIn the world of Godzilla spider mites,
p259
aVwe can make millions of mirrors,
p260
aVeach one-fifth the diameter
p261
aVof a human hair,
p262
aVmoving at hundreds of thousands of times per second
p263
aVto make large screen displays,
p264
aVso that we can watch movies like "Godzilla"
p265
aVin high-def.
p266
aa(lp267
VAnd if we can build machines
p268
aVat that scale,
p269
aVwhat about Eiffel Tower-like trusses
p270
aVat the microscale?
p271
aVToday we are making metals
p272
aVthat are lighter than Styrofoam,
p273
aVso light
p274
aVthey can sit atop a dandelion puff
p275
aVand be blown away
p276
aVwith a wisp of air \u2014
p277
aVso light
p278
aVthat you can make a car that two people can lift,
p279
aVbut so strong
p280
aVthat it has the crash-worthiness of an SUV.
p281
aa(lp282
VFrom the smallest wisp of air
p283
aVto the powerful forces of nature's storms.
p284
aVThere are 44 lightning strikes per second
p285
aVaround the globe.
p286
aVEach lightning bolt heats the air
p287
aVto 44,000 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014
p288
aVhotter than the surface of the Sun.
p289
aVWhat if we could use
p290
aVthese electromagnetic pulses
p291
aVas beacons,
p292
aVbeacons in a moving network
p293
aVof powerful transmitters?
p294
aVExperiments suggest
p295
aVthat lightning could be the next GPS.
p296
aa(lp297
VElectrical pulses form the thoughts in our brains.
p298
aVUsing a grid the size of your thumb,
p299
aVwith 32 electrodes
p300
aVon the surface of his brain,
p301
aVTim uses his thoughts
p302
aVto control an advanced prosthetic arm.
p303
aVAnd his thoughts
p304
aVmade him reach for Katie.
p305
aVThis is the first time
p306
aVa human has controlled a robot
p307
aVwith thought alone.
p308
aVAnd it is the first time
p309
aVthat Tim has held Katie's hand
p310
aVin seven years.
p311
aVThat moment mattered
p312
aVto Tim and Katie,
p313
aVand this green goo
p314
aVmay someday matter to you.
p315
aVThis green goo
p316
aVis perhaps the vaccine that could save your life.
p317
aVIt was made in tobacco plants.
p318
aVTobacco plants
p319
aVcan make millions of doses of vaccine
p320
aVin weeks instead of months,
p321
aVand it might just be
p322
aVthe first healthy use of tobacco ever.
p323
aa(lp324
VAnd if it seems far-fetched
p325
aVthat tobacco plants could make people healthy,
p326
aVwhat about gamers that could solve problems
p327
aVthat experts can't solve?
p328
aVLast September,
p329
aVthe gamers of Foldit
p330
aVsolved the three-dimensional structure
p331
aVof the retroviral protease
p332
aVthat contributes to AIDS in rhesus monkeys.
p333
aVNow understanding this structure
p334
aVis very important for developing treatments.
p335
aVFor 15 years,
p336
aVit was unsolved
p337
aVin the scientific community.
p338
aVThe gamers of Foldit
p339
aVsolved it in 15 days.
p340
aVNow they were able to do so
p341
aVby working together.
p342
aVThey were able to work together
p343
aVbecause they're connected by the Internet.
p344
aVAnd others, also connected to the Internet,
p345
aVused it as an instrument of democracy.
p346
aVAnd together
p347
aVthey changed the fate of their nation.
p348
aa(lp349
VThe Internet is home to two billion people,
p350
aVor 30 percent of the world's population.
p351
aVIt allows us to contribute
p352
aVand to be heard
p353
aVas individuals.
p354
aVIt allows us to amplify
p355
aVour voices and our power
p356
aVas a group.
p357
aVBut it too had humble beginnings.
p358
aVIn 1969, the internet was but a dream,
p359
aVa few sketches on a piece of paper.
p360
aVAnd then on October 29th,
p361
aVthe first packet-switched message was sent
p362
aVfrom UCLA to SRI.
p363
aVThe first two letters of the word "Login,"
p364
aVthat's all that made it through \u2014
p365
aVan L and an O \u2014
p366
aVand then a buffer overflow crashed the system.
p367
aV(Laughter)
p368
aVTwo letters,
p369
aVan L and an O,
p370
aVnow a worldwide force.
p371
aa(lp372
VSo who are these scientists and engineers
p373
aVat a magical place called DARPA?
p374
aVThey are nerds,
p375
aVand they are heroes among us.
p376
aVThey challenge existing perspectives
p377
aVat the edges of science
p378
aVand under the most demanding of conditions.
p379
aVThey remind us
p380
aVthat we can change the world
p381
aVif we defy the impossible
p382
aVand we refuse to fear failure.
p383
aVThey remind us
p384
aVthat we all have nerd power.
p385
aVSometimes we just forget.
p386
aa(lp387
VYou see, there was a time
p388
aVwhen you weren't afraid of failure,
p389
aVwhen you were a great artist or a great dancer
p390
aVand you could sing, you were good at math,
p391
aVyou could build things, you were an astronaut,
p392
aVan adventurer, Jacques Cousteau,
p393
aVyou could jump higher, run faster,
p394
aVkick harder than anyone.
p395
aVYou believed in impossible things
p396
aVand you were fearless.
p397
aVYou were totally and completely in touch
p398
aVwith your inner superhero.
p399
aVScientists and engineers
p400
aVcan indeed change the world.
p401
aVSo can you.
p402
aVYou were born to.
p403
aVSo go ahead,
p404
aVask yourself,
p405
aVwhat would you attempt to do
p406
aVif you knew you could not fail?
p407
aa(lp408
VNow I want to say,
p409
aVthis is not easy.
p410
aVIt's hard to hold onto this feeling,
p411
aVreally hard.
p412
aVI guess in some way,
p413
aVI sort of believe it's supposed to be hard.
p414
aVDoubt and fear always creep in.
p415
aVWe think someone else, someone smarter than us,
p416
aVsomeone more capable,
p417
aVsomeone with more resources will solve that problem.
p418
aVBut there isn't anyone else;
p419
aVthere's just you.
p420
aVAnd if we're lucky,
p421
aVin that moment,
p422
aVsomeone steps into that doubt and fear,
p423
aVtakes a hand and says,
p424
aV"Let me help you believe."
p425
aa(lp426
VJason Harley did that for me.
p427
aVJason started at DARPA
p428
aVon March 18th, 2010.
p429
aVHe was with our transportation team.
p430
aVI saw Jason nearly every day,
p431
aVsometimes twice a day.
p432
aVAnd more so than most,
p433
aVhe saw the highs and the lows,
p434
aVthe celebrations and the disappointments.
p435
aVAnd on one particularly dark day for me,
p436
aVJason sat down
p437
aVand he wrote an email.
p438
aVHe was encouraging,
p439
aVbut firm.
p440
aVAnd when he hit send,
p441
aVhe probably didn't realize what a difference it would make.
p442
aVIt mattered to me.
p443
aVIn that moment
p444
aVand still today
p445
aVwhen I doubt,
p446
aVwhen I feel afraid,
p447
aVwhen I need to reconnect
p448
aVwith that feeling,
p449
aVI remember his words,
p450
aVthey were so powerful.
p451
aa(lp452
VText: "There is only time enough to iron your cape
p453
aVand back to the skies for you."
p454
aa(lp455

aa(lp463

p466
aVAnd remember,
p467
aVbe nice to nerds.
p468
aV(Applause)
p469
aVThank you. Thank you.
p470
aa(lp471
V(Applause)
p472
aa(lp473
VChris Anderson: Regina, thank you.
p474
aVI have a couple of questions.
p475
aVSo that glider of yours,
p476
aVthe Mach 20 glider,
p477
aVthe first one, no control, it ended up in the Pacific I think somewhere.
p478
aa(lp479
VRD: Yeah, yeah. It did. (CA: What happened on that second flight?)
p480
aVYeah, it also went into the Pacific. (CA: But this time under control?)
p481
aVWe didn't fly it into the Pacific.
p482
aVNo, there are multiple portions of the trajectory
p483
aVthat are demanding
p484
aVin terms of really flying at that speed.
p485
aVAnd so in the second flight,
p486
aVwe were able to get three minutes
p487
aVof fully aerodynamic control of the vehicle before we lost it.
p488
aa(lp489
VCA: I imagine you're not planning to open up to passenger service
p490
aVfrom New York to Long Beach anytime soon.
p491
aa(lp492
VRD: It might be a little warm.
p493
aa(lp494
VCA: What do you picture that glider being used for?
p495
aa(lp496
VRD: Well our responsibility
p497
aVis to develop the technology for this.
p498
aVHow it's ultimately used
p499
aVwill be determined by the military.
p500
aVNow the purpose of the vehicle though,
p501
aVthe purpose of the technology,
p502
aVis to be able to reach anywhere in the world
p503
aVin less than 60 minutes.
p504
aa(lp505
VCA: And to carry a payload
p506
aVof more than a few pounds? (RD: Yeah.)
p507
aVLike what's the payload it could carry?
p508
aa(lp509
VRD: Well I don't think we ultimately know what it will be, right.
p510
aVWe've got to fly it first.
p511
aa(lp512
VCA: But not necessarily just a camera?
p513
aa(lp514
VRD: No, not necessarily just a camera.
p515
aa(lp516
VCA: It's amazing.
p517
aVThe hummingbird?
p518
aa(lp519
VRD: Yeah?
p520
aa(lp521
VCA: I'm curious, you started your beautiful sequence on flight
p522
aVwith a plane kind of trying to flap its wings
p523
aVand failing horribly,
p524
aVand there haven't been that many planes built since
p525
aVthat flap wings.
p526
aVWhy did we think that this was the time to go biomimicry
p527
aVand copy a hummingbird?
p528
aVIsn't that a very expensive solution
p529
aVfor a small maneuverable flying object?
p530
aa(lp531
VRD: So I mean, in part,
p532
aVwe wondered if it was possible to do it.
p533
aVAnd you have to revisit these questions
p534
aVover time.
p535
aVThe folks at AeroVironment
p536
aVtried 300 or more different wing designs,
p537
aV12 different forms of the avionics.
p538
aVIt took them 10 full prototypes
p539
aVto get something that would actually fly.
p540
aVBut there's something really interesting
p541
aVabout a flying machine
p542
aVthat looks like something you'd recognize.
p543
aVSo we often talk about stealth
p544
aVas a means for avoiding any type of sensing,
p545
aVbut when things looks just natural,
p546
aVyou also don't see them.
p547
aa(lp548
VCA: Ah. So it's not necessarily just the performance.
p549
aVIt's partly the look. (RD: Sure.)
p550
aVIt's actually, "Look at that cute hummingbird
p551
aVflying into my headquarters."
p552
aV(Laughter)
p553
aVBecause I think, as well as the awe of looking at that,
p554
aVI'm sure some people here are thinking,
p555
aVtechnology catches up so quick,
p556
aVhow long is it
p557
aVbefore some crazed geek with a little remote control
p558
aVflies one through a window of the White House?
p559
aVI mean, do you worry about the Pandora's box issue here?
p560
aa(lp561
VRD: Well look, our singular mission
p562
aVis the creation and prevention of strategic surprise.
p563
aVThat's what we do.
p564
aVIt would be inconceivable
p565
aVfor us to do that work
p566
aVif we didn't make people excited and uncomfortable with the things that we do
p567
aVat the same time.
p568
aVIt's just the nature of what we do.
p569
aVNow our responsibility
p570
aVis to push that edge.
p571
aVAnd we have to be, of course, mindful and responsible
p572
aVof how the technology is developed
p573
aVand ultimately used,
p574
aVbut we can't simply close our eyes
p575
aVand pretend that it isn't advancing; it's advancing.
p576
aa(lp577
VCA: I mean, you're clearly a really inspiring leader.
p578
aVAnd you persuade people
p579
aVto go to these great feats of invention,
p580
aVbut at a personal level,
p581
aVin a way I can't imagine doing your job.
p582
aVDo you wake up in the night sometimes,
p583
aVjust asking questions
p584
aVabout the possibly unintended consequences
p585
aVof your team's brilliance?
p586
aa(lp587
VRD: Sure.
p588
aVI think you couldn't be human
p589
aVif you didn't ask those questions.
p590
aa(lp591
VCA: How do you answer them?
p592
aa(lp593
VRD: Well I don't always have answers for them, right.
p594
aVI think that we learn
p595
aVas time goes on.
p596
aVMy job is one of the most exhilarating jobs you could have.
p597
aVI work with some of the most amazing people.
p598
aVAnd with that exhilaration,
p599
aVcomes a really deep sense
p600
aVof responsibility.
p601
aVAnd so you have on the one hand
p602
aVthis tremendous lift
p603
aVof what's possible
p604
aVand this tremendous seriousness
p605
aVof what it means.
p606
aa(lp607
VCA: Regina, that was jaw-dropping, as they say.
p608
aVThank you so much for coming to TED. (RD: Thank you.)

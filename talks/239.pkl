VFifty years ago in the old Soviet Union,
p5
aVa team of engineers was secretly moving a large object
p6
aVthrough a desolate countryside.
p7
aVWith it, they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere
p8
aVby being the first to conquer outer space.
p9
aVThe rocket was huge.
p10
aVAnd packed in its nose was a silver ball
p11
aVwith two radios inside.
p12
aa(lp13
VOn October 4, 1957, they launched their rocket.
p14
aVOne of the Russian scientists wrote at the time:
p15
aV"We are about to create a new planet
p16
aVthat we will call Sputnik.
p17
aVIn the olden days, explorers
p18
aVlike Vasco da Gama and Columbus
p19
aVhad the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe.
p20
aVNow we have the good fortune to open up space.
p21
aVAnd it is for those in the future to envy us our joy."
p22
aa(lp23
VYou're watching snippets from "Sputnik," my fifth documentary feature,
p24
aVwhich is just about completed.
p25
aVIt tells the story of Sputnik,
p26
aVand the story of what happened to America as a result.
p27
aVFor days after the launch,
p28
aVSputnik was a wonderful curiosity.
p29
aVA man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens,
p30
aVit inspired awe and pride
p31
aVthat humans had finally launched an object into space.
p32
aa(lp33
VBut just three days later, on a day they called Red Monday,
p34
aVthe media and the politicians told us,
p35
aVand we believed, that Sputnik was proof
p36
aVthat our enemy had beaten us
p37
aVin science and technology,
p38
aVand that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs,
p39
aVusing their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile.
p40
aa(lp41
VAll hell broke loose.
p42
aVSputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America \u2014
p43
aVhistorians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or 9/11.
p44
aVIt provoked the missile gap.
p45
aVIt exploded an arms race.
p46
aVIt began the space race.
p47
aVWithin a year, Congress funded huge weapons increases,
p48
aVand we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons
p49
aVto 20,000.
p50
aVAnd the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases.
p51
aa(lp52
VFor example, some here will remember
p53
aVthis day, June 1958,
p54
aVthe National Civil Defense Drill,
p55
aVwhere tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground.
p56
aVOr the Gallup Poll that showed that seven in 10 Americans
p57
aVbelieved that a nuclear war would happen,
p58
aVand that at least 50 percent of our population
p59
aVwas going to be killed.
p60
aa(lp61
VBut Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well.
p62
aVFor example, some in this room went to school on scholarship
p63
aVbecause of Sputnik.
p64
aVSupport for engineering, math and science \u2014
p65
aVeducation in general \u2014 boomed.
p66
aVAnd Vint Cerf points out that Sputnik
p67
aVled directly to ARPA, and the Internet,
p68
aVand, of course, NASA.
p69
aa(lp70
VMy feature documentary shows how a free society
p71
aVcan be stampeded by those who know how to use media.
p72
aVBut it also shows how we can turn
p73
aVwhat appears at first to be a bad situation,
p74
aVinto something that was overall very good for America.
p75
aV"Sputnik" will soon be released.
p76
aa(lp77
VIn closing, I would like to take a moment to thank
p78
aVone of my investors:
p79
aVlongtime TEDster, Jay Walker.
p80
aVAnd I'd like to thank you all.
p81
aa(lp82
V(Applause).
p83
aa(lp84
VThank you, Chris.

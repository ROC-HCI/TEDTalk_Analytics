VCan we, as adults, grow new nerve cells?
p5
aVThere's still some confusion about that question,
p6
aVas this is a fairly new field of research.
p7
aVFor example, I was talking to one of my colleagues, Robert,
p8
aVwho is an oncologist,
p9
aVand he was telling me,
p10
aV"Sandrine, this is puzzling.
p11
aVSome of my patients that have been told they are cured of their cancer
p12
aVstill develop symptoms of depression."
p13
aVAnd I responded to him,
p14
aV"Well, from my point of view that makes sense.
p15
aVThe drug you give to your patients that stops the cancer cells multiplying
p16
aValso stops the newborn neurons being generated in their brain."
p17
aVAnd then Robert looked at me like I was crazy and said,
p18
aV"But Sandrine, these are adult patients \u2014
p19
aVadults do not grow new nerve cells."
p20
aVAnd much to his surprise, I said, "Well actually, we do."
p21
aVAnd this is a phenomenon that we call neurogenesis.
p22
aa(lp23
V[Neurogenesis]
p24
aa(lp25
VNow Robert is not a neuroscientist,
p26
aVand when he went to medical school he was not taught what we know now \u2014
p27
aVthat the adult brain can generate new nerve cells.
p28
aVSo Robert, you know, being the good doctor that he is,
p29
aVwanted to come to my lab
p30
aVto understand the topic a little bit better.
p31
aVAnd I took him for a tour
p32
aVof one of the most exciting parts of the brain
p33
aVwhen it comes to neurogenesis \u2014
p34
aVand this is the hippocampus.
p35
aVSo this is this gray structure in the center of the brain.
p36
aVAnd what we've known already for very long,
p37
aVis that this is important for learning, memory, mood and emotion.
p38
aVHowever, what we have learned more recently
p39
aVis that this is one of the unique structures of the adult brain
p40
aVwhere new neurons can be generated.
p41
aVAnd if we slice through the hippocampus
p42
aVand zoom in,
p43
aVwhat you actually see here in blue
p44
aVis a newborn neuron in an adult mouse brain.
p45
aVSo when it comes to the human brain \u2014
p46
aVmy colleague Jonas Frisén from the Karolinska Institutet,
p47
aVhas estimated that we produce 700 new neurons per day
p48
aVin the hippocampus.
p49
aVYou might think this is not much,
p50
aVcompared to the billions of neurons we have.
p51
aVBut by the time we turn 50,
p52
aVwe will have all exchanged the neurons we were born with in that structure
p53
aVwith adult-born neurons.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo why are these new neurons important and what are their functions?
p56
aVFirst, we know that they're important for learning and memory.
p57
aVAnd in the lab we have shown
p58
aVthat if we block the ability of the adult brain
p59
aVto produce new neurons in the hippocampus,
p60
aVthen we block certain memory abilities.
p61
aVAnd this is especially new and true for spatial recognition \u2014
p62
aVso like, how you navigate your way in the city.
p63
aa(lp64
VWe are still learning a lot,
p65
aVand neurons are not only important for memory capacity,
p66
aVbut also for the quality of the memory.
p67
aVAnd they will have been helpful to add time to our memory
p68
aVand they will help differentiate very similar memories, like:
p69
aVhow do you find your bike
p70
aVthat you park at the station every day in the same area,
p71
aVbut in a slightly different position?
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd more interesting to my colleague Robert
p74
aVis the research we have been doing on neurogenesis and depression.
p75
aVSo in an animal model of depression,
p76
aVwe have seen that we have a lower level of neurogenesis.
p77
aVAnd if we give antidepressants,
p78
aVthen we increase the production of these newborn neurons,
p79
aVand we decrease the symptoms of depression,
p80
aVestablishing a clear link between neurogenesis and depression.
p81
aVBut moreover, if you just block neurogenesis,
p82
aVthen you block the efficacy of the antidepressant.
p83
aVSo by then, Robert had understood
p84
aVthat very likely his patients were suffering from depression
p85
aVeven after being cured of their cancer,
p86
aVbecause the cancer drug had stopped newborn neurons from being generated.
p87
aVAnd it will take time to generate new neurons
p88
aVthat reach normal functions.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo, collectively, now we think we have enough evidence
p91
aVto say that neurogenesis is a target of choice
p92
aVif we want to improve memory formation or mood,
p93
aVor even prevent the decline associated with aging,
p94
aVor associated with stress.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo the next question is:
p97
aVcan we control neurogenesis?
p98
aVThe answer is yes.
p99
aVAnd we are now going to do a little quiz.
p100
aVI'm going to give you a set of behaviors and activities,
p101
aVand you tell me if you think they will increase neurogenesis
p102
aVor if they will decrease neurogenesis.
p103
aVAre we ready?
p104
aVOK, let's go.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo what about learning?
p107
aVIncreasing?
p108
aVYes.
p109
aVLearning will increase the production of these new neurons.
p110
aa(lp111
VHow about stress?
p112
aVYes, stress will decrease the production of new neurons in the hippocampus.
p113
aa(lp114
VHow about sleep deprivation?
p115
aVIndeed, it will decrease neurogenesis.
p116
aa(lp117
VHow about sex?
p118
aVOh, wow!
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VYes, you are right, it will increase the production of new neurons.
p123
aVHowever, it's all about balance here.
p124
aVWe don't want to fall in a situation \u2014
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
Vabout too much sex leading to sleep deprivation.
p129
aa(lp130
V(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
VHow about getting older?
p133
aVSo the neurogenesis rate will decrease as we get older,
p134
aVbut it is still occurring.
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd then finally, how about running?
p137
aVI will let you judge that one by yourself.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo this is one of the first studies
p140
aVthat was carried out by one of my mentors, Rusty Gage from the Salk Institute,
p141
aVshowing that the environment can have an impact
p142
aVon the production of new neurons.
p143
aVAnd here you see a section of the hippocampus of a mouse
p144
aVthat had no running wheel in its cage.
p145
aVAnd the little black dots you see are actually newborn neurons-to-be.
p146
aVAnd now, you see a section of the hippocampus of a mouse
p147
aVthat had a running wheel in its cage.
p148
aVSo you see the massive increase
p149
aVof the black dots representing the new neurons-to-be.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo activity impacts neurogenesis, but that's not all.
p152
aVWhat you eat will have an effect
p153
aVon the production of new neurons in the hippocampus.
p154
aVSo here we have a sample of diet \u2014
p155
aVof nutrients that have been shown to have efficacy.
p156
aVAnd I'm just going to point a few out to you:
p157
aVCalorie restriction of 20 to 30 percent will increase neurogenesis.
p158
aVIntermittent fasting \u2014 spacing the time between your meals \u2014
p159
aVwill increase neurogenesis.
p160
aVIntake of flavonoids,
p161
aVwhich are contained in dark chocolate or blueberries,
p162
aVwill increase neurogenesis.
p163
aVOmega-3 fatty acids,
p164
aVpresent in fatty fish, like salmon,
p165
aVwill increase the production of these new neurons.
p166
aVConversely, a diet rich in high saturated fat
p167
aVwill have a negative impact on neurogenesis.
p168
aVEthanol \u2014 intake of alcohol \u2014 will decrease neurogenesis.
p169
aVHowever, not everything is lost;
p170
aVresveratrol, which is contained in red wine,
p171
aVhas been shown to promote the survival of these new neurons.
p172
aVSo next time you are at a dinner party,
p173
aVyou might want to reach for this possibly "neurogenesis-neutral" drink.
p174
aa(lp175
V(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VAnd then finally, let me point out the last one \u2014
p178
aVa quirky one.
p179
aVSo Japanese groups are fascinated with food textures,
p180
aVand they have shown that actually soft diet impairs neurogenesis,
p181
aVas opposed to food that requires mastication \u2014 chewing \u2014 or crunchy food.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo all of this data,
p184
aVwhere we need to look at the cellular level,
p185
aVhas been generated using animal models.
p186
aVBut this diet has also been given to human participants,
p187
aVand what we could see is that the diet modulates memory and mood
p188
aVin the same direction as it modulates neurogenesis,
p189
aVsuch as: calorie restriction will improve memory capacity,
p190
aVwhereas a high-fat diet will exacerbate symptoms of depression \u2014
p191
aVas opposed to omega-3 fatty acids, which increase neurogenesis,
p192
aVand also help to decrease the symptoms of depression.
p193
aVSo we think that the effect of diet
p194
aVon mental health, on memory and mood,
p195
aVis actually mediated by the production of the new neurons in the hippocampus.
p196
aVAnd it's not only what you eat,
p197
aVbut it's also the texture of the food, when you eat it
p198
aVand how much of it you eat.
p199
aa(lp200
VOn our side \u2014 neuroscientists interested in neurogenesis \u2014
p201
aVwe need to understand better the function of these new neurons,
p202
aVand how we can control their survival and their production.
p203
aVWe also need to find a way to protect the neurogenesis of Robert's patients.
p204
aVAnd on your side \u2014
p205
aVI leave you in charge of your neurogenesis.
p206
aa(lp207
VThank you.
p208
aa(lp209
V(Applause)
p210
aa(lp211
VMargaret Heffernan: Fantastic research, Sandrine.
p212
aVNow, I told you you changed my life \u2014
p213
aVI now eat a lot of blueberries.
p214
aa(lp215
VSandrine Thuret: Very good.
p216
aa(lp217
VMH: I'm really interested in the running thing.
p218
aVDo I have to run?
p219
aVOr is it really just about aerobic exercise,
p220
aVgetting oxygen to the brain?
p221
aVCould it be any kind of vigorous exercise?
p222
aa(lp223
VST: So for the moment,
p224
aVwe can't really say if it's just the running itself,
p225
aVbut we think that anything that indeed will increase the production \u2014
p226
aVor moving the blood flow to the brain,
p227
aVshould be beneficial.
p228
aa(lp229
VMH: So I don't have to get a running wheel in my office?
p230
aa(lp231
VST: No, you don't!
p232
aa(lp233
VMH: Oh, what a relief! That's wonderful.
p234
aVSandrine Thuret, thank you so much.
p235
aa(lp236
VST: Thank you, Margaret.

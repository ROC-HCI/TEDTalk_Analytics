VThe world is changing
p5
aVwith really remarkable speed.
p6
aVIf you look at the chart at the top here,
p7
aVyou'll see that in 2025,
p8
aVthese Goldman Sachs projections
p9
aVsuggest that the Chinese economy
p10
aVwill be almost the same size as the American economy.
p11
aVAnd if you look at the chart
p12
aVfor 2050,
p13
aVit's projected that the Chinese economy
p14
aVwill be twice the size of the American economy,
p15
aVand the Indian economy will be almost the same size
p16
aVas the American economy.
p17
aVAnd we should bear in mind here
p18
aVthat these projections were drawn up
p19
aVbefore the Western financial crisis.
p20
aa(lp21
VA couple of weeks ago,
p22
aVI was looking at the latest projection
p23
aVby BNP Paribas
p24
aVfor when China
p25
aVwill have a larger economy
p26
aVthan the United States.
p27
aVGoldman Sachs projected 2027.
p28
aVThe post-crisis projection
p29
aVis 2020.
p30
aVThat's just a decade away.
p31
aVChina is going to change the world
p32
aVin two fundamental respects.
p33
aVFirst of all,
p34
aVit's a huge developing country
p35
aVwith a population of 1.3 billion people,
p36
aVwhich has been growing for over 30 years
p37
aVat around 10 percent a year.
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd within a decade,
p40
aVit will have the largest economy in the world.
p41
aVNever before in the modern era
p42
aVhas the largest economy in the world
p43
aVbeen that of a developing country,
p44
aVrather than a developed country.
p45
aVSecondly,
p46
aVfor the first time in the modern era,
p47
aVthe dominant country in the world \u2014
p48
aVwhich I think is what China will become \u2014
p49
aVwill be not from the West
p50
aVand from very, very different civilizational roots.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, I know it's a widespread assumption in the West
p53
aVthat as countries modernize,
p54
aVthey also westernize.
p55
aVThis is an illusion.
p56
aVIt's an assumption that modernity
p57
aVis a product simply of competition, markets and technology.
p58
aVIt is not. It is also shaped equally
p59
aVby history and culture.
p60
aVChina is not like the West,
p61
aVand it will not become like the West.
p62
aVIt will remain in very fundamental respects
p63
aVvery different.
p64
aVNow the big question here is obviously,
p65
aVhow do we make sense of China?
p66
aVHow do we try to understand what China is?
p67
aVAnd the problem we have in the West at the moment, by and large,
p68
aVis that the conventional approach
p69
aVis that we understand it really in Western terms,
p70
aVusing Western ideas.
p71
aVWe can't.
p72
aVNow I want to offer you
p73
aVthree building blocks
p74
aVfor trying to understand what China is like,
p75
aVjust as a beginning.
p76
aa(lp77
VThe first is this:
p78
aVthat China is not really a nation-state.
p79
aVOkay, it's called itself a nation-state
p80
aVfor the last hundred years,
p81
aVbut everyone who knows anything about China
p82
aVknows it's a lot older than this.
p83
aVThis was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty
p84
aVin 221 B.C. at the end of the warring-state period \u2014
p85
aVthe birth of modern China.
p86
aVAnd you can see it against the boundaries of modern China.
p87
aVOr immediately afterward, the Han Dynasty,
p88
aVstill 2,000 years ago.
p89
aVAnd you can see already it occupies
p90
aVmost of what we now know as Eastern China,
p91
aVwhich is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then
p92
aVand live now.
p93
aa(lp94
VNow what is extraordinary about this
p95
aVis, what gives China its sense of being China,
p96
aVwhat gives the Chinese
p97
aVthe sense of what it is to be Chinese,
p98
aVcomes not from the last hundred years,
p99
aVnot from the nation-state period,
p100
aVwhich is what happened in the West,
p101
aVbut from the period, if you like,
p102
aVof the civilization-state.
p103
aVI'm thinking here, for example,
p104
aVof customs like ancestral worship,
p105
aVof a very distinctive notion of the state,
p106
aVlikewise, a very distinctive notion of the family,
p107
aVsocial relationships like guanxi,
p108
aVConfucian values and so on.
p109
aVThese are all things that come
p110
aVfrom the period of the civilization-state.
p111
aVIn other words, China, unlike the Western states and most countries in the world,
p112
aVis shaped by its sense of civilization,
p113
aVits existence as a civilization-state,
p114
aVrather than as a nation-state.
p115
aVAnd there's one other thing to add to this, and that is this:
p116
aVOf course we know China's big, huge,
p117
aVdemographically and geographically,
p118
aVwith a population of 1.3 billion people.
p119
aVWhat we often aren't really aware of
p120
aVis the fact
p121
aVthat China is extremely diverse
p122
aVand very pluralistic,
p123
aVand in many ways very decentralized.
p124
aVYou can't run a place on this scale simply from Beijing,
p125
aVeven though we think this to be the case.
p126
aVIt's never been the case.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo this is China, a civilization-state,
p129
aVrather than a nation-state.
p130
aVAnd what does it mean?
p131
aVWell, I think it has all sorts of profound implications.
p132
aVI'll give you two quick ones.
p133
aVThe first is that
p134
aVthe most important political value for the Chinese
p135
aVis unity,
p136
aVis the maintenance
p137
aVof Chinese civilization.
p138
aVYou know, 2,000 years ago, Europe:
p139
aVbreakdown \u2014 the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire.
p140
aVIt divided, and it's remained divided ever since.
p141
aVChina, over the same time period,
p142
aVwent in exactly the opposite direction,
p143
aVvery painfully holding this huge civilization,
p144
aVcivilization-state, together.
p145
aa(lp146
VThe second
p147
aVis maybe more prosaic,
p148
aVwhich is Hong Kong.
p149
aVDo you remember the handover of Hong Kong
p150
aVby Britain to China in 1997?
p151
aVYou may remember
p152
aVwhat the Chinese constitutional proposition was.
p153
aVOne country, two systems.
p154
aVAnd I'll lay a wager
p155
aVthat barely anyone in the West believed them.
p156
aV"Window dressing.
p157
aVWhen China gets its hands on Hong Kong,
p158
aVthat won't be the case."
p159
aVThirteen years on,
p160
aVthe political and legal system in Hong Kong
p161
aVis as different now as it was in 1997.
p162
aVWe were wrong. Why were we wrong?
p163
aVWe were wrong because we thought, naturally enough,
p164
aVin nation-state ways.
p165
aVThink of German unification, 1990.
p166
aVWhat happened?
p167
aVWell, basically the East was swallowed by the West.
p168
aVOne nation, one system.
p169
aVThat is the nation-state mentality.
p170
aVBut you can't run a country like China,
p171
aVa civilization-state,
p172
aVon the basis of one civilization, one system.
p173
aVIt doesn't work.
p174
aVSo actually the response of China
p175
aVto the question of Hong Kong \u2014
p176
aVas it will be to the question of Taiwan \u2014
p177
aVwas a natural response:
p178
aVone civilization, many systems.
p179
aa(lp180
VLet me offer you another building block
p181
aVto try and understand China \u2014
p182
aVmaybe not sort of a comfortable one.
p183
aVThe Chinese have a very, very different
p184
aVconception of race
p185
aVto most other countries.
p186
aVDo you know,
p187
aVof the 1.3 billion Chinese,
p188
aVover 90 percent of them
p189
aVthink they belong to the same race,
p190
aVthe Han?
p191
aVNow, this is completely different
p192
aVfrom the world's [other] most populous countries.
p193
aVIndia, the United States,
p194
aVIndonesia, Brazil \u2014
p195
aVall of them are multiracial.
p196
aVThe Chinese don't feel like that.
p197
aVChina is only multiracial
p198
aVreally at the margins.
p199
aVSo the question is, why?
p200
aVWell the reason, I think, essentially
p201
aVis, again, back to the civilization-state.
p202
aVA history of at least 2,000 years,
p203
aVa history of conquest, occupation,
p204
aVabsorption, assimilation and so on,
p205
aVled to the process by which,
p206
aVover time, this notion of the Han emerged \u2014
p207
aVof course, nurtured
p208
aVby a growing and very powerful sense
p209
aVof cultural identity.
p210
aa(lp211
VNow the great advantage of this historical experience
p212
aVhas been that, without the Han,
p213
aVChina could never have held together.
p214
aVThe Han identity has been the cement
p215
aVwhich has held this country together.
p216
aVThe great disadvantage of it
p217
aVis that the Han have a very weak conception
p218
aVof cultural difference.
p219
aVThey really believe
p220
aVin their own superiority,
p221
aVand they are disrespectful
p222
aVof those who are not.
p223
aVHence their attitude, for example,
p224
aVto the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans.
p225
aa(lp226
VOr let me give you my third building block,
p227
aVthe Chinese state.
p228
aVNow the relationship
p229
aVbetween the state and society in China
p230
aVis very different from that in the West.
p231
aVNow we in the West
p232
aVoverwhelmingly seem to think \u2014 in these days at least \u2014
p233
aVthat the authority and legitimacy of the state
p234
aVis a function of democracy.
p235
aVThe problem with this proposition
p236
aVis that the Chinese state
p237
aVenjoys more legitimacy
p238
aVand more authority
p239
aVamongst the Chinese
p240
aVthan is true
p241
aVwith any Western state.
p242
aVAnd the reason for this
p243
aVis because \u2014
p244
aVwell, there are two reasons, I think.
p245
aVAnd it's obviously got nothing to do with democracy,
p246
aVbecause in our terms the Chinese certainly don't have a democracy.
p247
aVAnd the reason for this is,
p248
aVfirstly, because the state in China
p249
aVis given a very special \u2014
p250
aVit enjoys a very special significance
p251
aVas the representative,
p252
aVthe embodiment and the guardian
p253
aVof Chinese civilization,
p254
aVof the civilization-state.
p255
aVThis is as close as China gets
p256
aVto a kind of spiritual role.
p257
aa(lp258
VAnd the second reason is because,
p259
aVwhereas in Europe
p260
aVand North America,
p261
aVthe state's power is continuously challenged \u2014
p262
aVI mean in the European tradition,
p263
aVhistorically against the church,
p264
aVagainst other sectors of the aristocracy,
p265
aVagainst merchants and so on \u2014
p266
aVfor 1,000 years,
p267
aVthe power of the Chinese state
p268
aVhas not been challenged.
p269
aVIt's had no serious rivals.
p270
aVSo you can see
p271
aVthat the way in which power has been constructed in China
p272
aVis very different from our experience
p273
aVin Western history.
p274
aVThe result, by the way,
p275
aVis that the Chinese have a very different view of the state.
p276
aVWhereas we tend to view it as an intruder,
p277
aVa stranger,
p278
aVcertainly an organ
p279
aVwhose powers need to be limited
p280
aVor defined and constrained,
p281
aVthe Chinese don't see the state like that at all.
p282
aVThe Chinese view the state
p283
aVas an intimate \u2014 not just as an intimate actually,
p284
aVas a member of the family \u2014
p285
aVnot just in fact as a member of the family,
p286
aVbut as the head of the family,
p287
aVthe patriarch of the family.
p288
aVThis is the Chinese view of the state \u2014
p289
aVvery, very different to ours.
p290
aVIt's embedded in society in a different kind of way
p291
aVto what is the case
p292
aVin the West.
p293
aa(lp294
VAnd I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here,
p295
aVin the Chinese context,
p296
aVis a new kind of paradigm,
p297
aVwhich is different from anything
p298
aVwe've had to think about in the past.
p299
aVKnow that China believes in the market and the state.
p300
aVI mean, Adam Smith,
p301
aValready writing in the late 18th century, said,
p302
aV"The Chinese market is larger and more developed
p303
aVand more sophisticated
p304
aVthan anything in Europe."
p305
aVAnd, apart from the Mao period,
p306
aVthat has remained more or less the case ever since.
p307
aVBut this is combined
p308
aVwith an extremely strong and ubiquitous state.
p309
aVThe state is everywhere in China.
p310
aVI mean, it's leading firms \u2014
p311
aVmany of them are still publicly owned.
p312
aVPrivate firms, however large they are, like Lenovo,
p313
aVdepend in many ways on state patronage.
p314
aVTargets for the economy and so on
p315
aVare set by the state.
p316
aVAnd the state, of course, its authority flows into lots of other areas \u2014
p317
aVas we are familiar with \u2014
p318
aVwith something like the one-child policy.
p319
aa(lp320
VMoreover, this is a very old state tradition,
p321
aVa very old tradition of statecraft.
p322
aVI mean, if you want an illustration of this,
p323
aVthe Great Wall is one.
p324
aVBut this is another, this is the Grand Canal,
p325
aVwhich was constructed in the first instance
p326
aVin the fifth century B.C.
p327
aVand was finally completed
p328
aVin the seventh century A.D.
p329
aVIt went for 1,114 miles,
p330
aVlinking Beijing
p331
aVwith Hangzhou and Shanghai.
p332
aVSo there's a long history
p333
aVof extraordinary state infrastructural projects
p334
aVin China,
p335
aVwhich I suppose helps us to explain what we see today,
p336
aVwhich is something like the Three Gorges Dam
p337
aVand many other expressions
p338
aVof state competence
p339
aVwithin China.
p340
aVSo there we have three building blocks
p341
aVfor trying to understand the difference that is China \u2014
p342
aVthe civilization-state,
p343
aVthe notion of race
p344
aVand the nature of the state
p345
aVand its relationship to society.
p346
aa(lp347
VAnd yet we still insist, by and large,
p348
aVin thinking that we can understand China
p349
aVby simply drawing on Western experience,
p350
aVlooking at it through Western eyes,
p351
aVusing Western concepts.
p352
aVIf you want to know why
p353
aVwe unerringly seem to get China wrong \u2014
p354
aVour predictions about what's going to happen to China are incorrect \u2014
p355
aVthis is the reason.
p356
aVUnfortunately, I think,
p357
aVI have to say that I think
p358
aVattitude towards China
p359
aVis that of a kind of little Westerner mentality.
p360
aVIt's kind of arrogant.
p361
aVIt's arrogant in the sense
p362
aVthat we think that we are best,
p363
aVand therefore we have the universal measure.
p364
aVAnd secondly, it's ignorant.
p365
aVWe refuse to really address
p366
aVthe issue of difference.
p367
aVYou know, there's a very interesting passage
p368
aVin a book by Paul Cohen, the American historian.
p369
aVAnd Paul Cohen argues
p370
aVthat the West thinks of itself
p371
aVas probably the most cosmopolitan
p372
aVof all cultures.
p373
aVBut it's not.
p374
aVIn many ways,
p375
aVit's the most parochial,
p376
aVbecause for 200 years,
p377
aVthe West has been so dominant in the world
p378
aVthat it's not really needed
p379
aVto understand other cultures,
p380
aVother civilizations.
p381
aVBecause, at the end of the day,
p382
aVit could, if necessary by force,
p383
aVget its own way.
p384
aVWhereas those cultures \u2014
p385
aVvirtually the rest of the world, in fact,
p386
aVwhich have been in a far weaker position, vis-a-vis the West \u2014
p387
aVhave been thereby forced to understand the West,
p388
aVbecause of the West's presence in those societies.
p389
aVAnd therefore, they are, as a result,
p390
aVmore cosmopolitan in many ways than the West.
p391
aa(lp392
VI mean, take the question of East Asia.
p393
aVEast Asia: Japan, Korea, China, etc. \u2014
p394
aVa third of the world's population lives there.
p395
aVNow the largest economic region in the world.
p396
aVAnd I'll tell you now,
p397
aVthat East Asianers, people from East Asia,
p398
aVare far more knowledgeable
p399
aVabout the West
p400
aVthan the West is about East Asia.
p401
aVNow this point is very germane, I'm afraid,
p402
aVto the present.
p403
aVBecause what's happening? Back to that chart at the beginning,
p404
aVthe Goldman Sachs chart.
p405
aVWhat is happening
p406
aVis that, very rapidly in historical terms,
p407
aVthe world is being driven
p408
aVand shaped,
p409
aVnot by the old developed countries,
p410
aVbut by the developing world.
p411
aVWe've seen this
p412
aVin terms of the G20
p413
aVusurping very rapidly the position of the G7,
p414
aVor the G8.
p415
aVAnd there are two consequences of this.
p416
aVFirst, the West
p417
aVis rapidly losing
p418
aVits influence in the world.
p419
aVThere was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago \u2014
p420
aVCopenhagen, climate change conference.
p421
aVEurope was not at the final negotiating table.
p422
aVWhen did that last happen?
p423
aVI would wager it was probably about 200 years ago.
p424
aVAnd that is what is going to happen in the future.
p425
aa(lp426
VAnd the second implication
p427
aVis that the world will inevitably, as a consequence,
p428
aVbecome increasingly unfamiliar to us,
p429
aVbecause it'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories
p430
aVthat we are not really familiar with,
p431
aVor conversant with.
p432
aVAnd at last, I'm afraid \u2014 take Europe;
p433
aVAmerica is slightly different \u2014
p434
aVbut Europeans by and large, I have to say,
p435
aVare ignorant,
p436
aVare unaware
p437
aVabout the way the world is changing.
p438
aVSome people \u2014 I've got an English friend in China,
p439
aVand he said, "The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion."
p440
aVWell, maybe that's true,
p441
aVmaybe that's an exaggeration.
p442
aVBut there's another problem which goes along with this \u2014
p443
aVthat Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world \u2014
p444
aVand that is a sort of
p445
aVloss of a sense of the future.
p446
aVI mean, Europe once, of course, once commanded the future
p447
aVin its confidence.
p448
aVTake the 19th century, for example.
p449
aVBut this, alas, is no longer true.
p450
aa(lp451
VIf you want to feel the future, if you want to taste the future,
p452
aVtry China \u2014 there's old Confucius.
p453
aVThis is a railway station
p454
aVthe likes of which you've never seen before.
p455
aVIt doesn't even look like a railway station.
p456
aVThis is the new [Wuhan] railway station
p457
aVfor the high-speed trains.
p458
aVChina already has a bigger network
p459
aVthan any other country in the world
p460
aVand will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together.
p461
aVOr take this: now this is an idea,
p462
aVbut it's an idea to be tried out shortly
p463
aVin a suburb of Beijing.
p464
aVHere you have a megabus,
p465
aVon the upper deck carries about 2,000 people.
p466
aVIt travels on rails
p467
aVdown a suburban road,
p468
aVand the cars travel underneath it.
p469
aVAnd it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour.
p470
aVNow this is the way things are going to move,
p471
aVbecause China has a very specific problem,
p472
aVwhich is different from Europe
p473
aVand different from the United States:
p474
aVChina has huge numbers of people and no space.
p475
aVSo this is a solution to a situation
p476
aVwhere China's going to have
p477
aVmany, many, many cities
p478
aVover 20 million people.
p479
aa(lp480
VOkay, so how would I like to finish?
p481

VPeople love their automobiles.
p5
aVThey allow us to go where we want to when we want to.
p6
aVThey're a form of entertainment,
p7
aVthey're a form of art,
p8
aVa pride of ownership.
p9
aVSongs are written about cars.
p10
aVPrince wrote a great song: "Little Red Corvette."
p11
aVHe didn't write "Little Red Laptop Computer" or "Little Red Dirt Devil."
p12
aVHe wrote about a car.
p13
aVOne of my favorites has always been:
p14
aV"Make Love to Your Man in a Chevy Van,"
p15
aVbecause that was my vehicle when I was in college.
p16
aa(lp17
VThe fact is, when we do our market research around the world,
p18
aVwe see there's a nearly universal aspiration on the part of people
p19
aVto own an automobile \u2014
p20
aV750 million people in the world today own a car.
p21
aVAnd you say, boy, that's a lot.
p22
aVBut you know what?
p23
aVThat's just 12 percent of the population.
p24
aVWe really have to ask the question:
p25
aVCan the world sustain that number of automobiles?
p26
aVAnd if you look at projections over the next 10 to 15 to 20 years,
p27
aVit looks like the world car park could grow
p28
aVto on the order of 1.1 billion vehicles.
p29
aVIf you park those end to end and wrap them around the Earth,
p30
aVthat would stretch around the Earth 125 times.
p31
aa(lp32
VNow, we've made great progress with automobile technology
p33
aVover the last 100 years.
p34
aVCars are dramatically cleaner, dramatically safer, more efficient
p35
aVand radically more affordable than they were 100 years ago.
p36
aVBut the fact remains:
p37
aVthe fundamental DNA of the automobile has stayed pretty much the same.
p38
aVIf we were to reinvent the automobile today, rather than 100 years ago,
p39
aVknowing what we know about the issues associated with our product
p40
aVand about the technologies that exist today,
p41
aVwhat would we do?
p42
aa(lp43
VWe wanted something that was really affordable.
p44
aVThe fuel cell looked great:
p45
aVone-tenth as many moving parts,
p46
aVa fuel-cell propulsion system as an internal combustion engine,
p47
aVand it emits just water.
p48
aVAnd we wanted to take advantage of Moore's Law
p49
aVwith electronic controls and software,
p50
aVand we absolutely wanted our car to be connected.
p51
aVSo we embarked upon the reinvention around an electrochemical engine,
p52
aVthe fuel cell,
p53
aVand hydrogen as the energy carrier.
p54
aVFirst was Autonomy.
p55
aVAutonomy really set the vision for where we wanted to head.
p56
aVWe embodied all of the key components of a fuel-cell propulsion system.
p57
aVWe then had Autonomy drivable with Hy-Wire,
p58
aVand we showed Hy-Wire here at this conference last year.
p59
aVHy-Wire is the world's first drivable fuel cell,
p60
aVand we have followed up that now with Sequel.
p61
aVAnd Sequel truly is a real car.
p62
aVSo if we could run the video \u2014
p63
aa(lp64
V(Futuristic music)
p65
aa(lp66
V[Reinventing the Automobile]
p67
aa(lp68
V(Video) It truly is my great pleasure to introduce Sequel.
p69
aa(lp70
V[Acceleration]
p71
aa(lp72
V[Cruising]
p73
aa(lp74
V[Steering]
p75
aa(lp76
V[Braking]
p77
aa(lp78
VBut the real key question I'm sure that's on your mind:
p79
aVWhere is the hydrogen going to come from?
p80
aVAnd secondly, when are these kinds of cars going to be available?
p81
aVSo let me talk about hydrogen first.
p82
aVThe beauty of hydrogen is it can come from so many different sources:
p83
aVit can come from fossil fuels,
p84
aVit can come from any way that you can create electricity,
p85
aVincluding renewables.
p86
aVAnd it can come from biofuels.
p87
aVAnd that's quite exciting.
p88
aVThe vision here is to have each local community play to its natural strength
p89
aVin creating the hydrogen.
p90
aVA lot of hydrogen is produced today in the world.
p91
aVIt's produced to get sulfur out of gasoline \u2014
p92
aVwhich I find is somewhat ironic.
p93
aVIt's produced in the fertilizer industry;
p94
aVit's produced in the chemical manufacturing industry.
p95
aVThat hydrogen is being made
p96
aVbecause there's a good business reason for its use.
p97
aVBut it tells us that we know how to create it,
p98
aVwe know how to create it cost-effectively,
p99
aVwe know how to handle it safely.
p100
aa(lp101
VWe did an analysis
p102
aVwhere you would have a station in each city
p103
aVwith each of the 100 largest cities in the United States,
p104
aVand located the stations
p105
aVso you'd be no more than two miles from a station at any time.
p106
aVWe put one every 25 miles on the freeway,
p107
aVand it turns out that translates into about 12,000 stations.
p108
aVAnd at a million dollars each, that would be about 12 billion dollars.
p109
aVThat's a lot of money.
p110
aVBut if you built the Alaskan pipeline today,
p111
aVthat's half of what the Alaskan pipeline would cost.
p112
aVBut the real exciting vision that we see, truly, is home refueling,
p113
aVmuch like recharging your laptop or recharging your cell phone.
p114
aVSo we're pretty excited about the future of hydrogen.
p115
aVWe think it's a question of not whether, but a question of when.
p116
aa(lp117
VWhat we've targeted for ourselves \u2014
p118
aVand we're making great progress toward this goal \u2014
p119
aVis to have a propulsion system based on hydrogen and fuel cells,
p120
aVdesigned and validated,
p121
aVthat can go head-to-head with the internal combustion engine.
p122
aVWe're talking about obsoleting the internal combustion engine,
p123
aVand doing it in terms of affordability at scale volumes,
p124
aVits performance and its durability.
p125
aVSo that's what we're driving to for 2010.
p126
aVWe haven't seen anything yet in our development work
p127
aVthat says that isn't possible.
p128
aVWe actually think the future is going to be event-driven.
p129
aVSo since we can't predict the future,
p130
aVwe want to spend a lot of our time trying to create that future.
p131
aa(lp132
VI'm very, very intrigued
p133
aVby the fact that our cars and trucks sit idle 90 percent of the time:
p134
aVthey're parked all around us.
p135
aVThey're usually parked within 100 feet of the people that own them.
p136
aVNow, if you take the power-generating capability of an automobile
p137
aVand you compare that to the electric grid in the United States,
p138
aVit turns out that the power in four percent of the automobiles
p139
aVequals that of the electric grid of the US.
p140
aVThat's a huge power-generating capability,
p141
aVa mobile power-generating capability.
p142
aVAnd hydrogen and fuel cells give us that opportunity
p143
aVto actually use our cars and trucks when they're parked
p144
aVto generate electricity for the grid.
p145
aa(lp146
VWe talked about swarm networks earlier.
p147
aVTalk about the ultimate swarm \u2014 having all of the processors
p148
aVand all of the cars when they're sitting idle
p149
aVbeing part of a global grid for computing capability.
p150
aVWe find that premise quite exciting.
p151
aVThe automobile becomes, then, an appliance \u2014
p152
aVnot in a commodity sense,
p153
aVbut an appliance, mobile power, mobile platform
p154
aVfor information and computing and communication,
p155
aVas well as a form of transportation.
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd the key to all of this is to make it affordable,
p158
aVto make it exciting,
p159
aVto get it on a pathway where there's a way to make money doing it.
p160
aVAnd again, this is a pretty big march to take here.
p161
aVA lot of people say:
p162
aVHow do you sleep at night
p163
aVwhen you're wrestling with a problem of that magnitude?
p164
aVI tell them I sleep like a baby: I wake up crying every two hours.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VActually, the theme of this conference, I think,
p169
aVhas hit on one of the major keys to pull that off,
p170
aVand that's relationships and working together.
p171
aVThank you very much.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Applause)
p174
aa(lp175
VChris Anderson: Larry, Larry \u2014 wait, wait, wait. Larry, wait one sec.
p176
aVI've got so many questions I could ask you.
p177
aVI just want to ask one.
p178
aVYou know, I could be wrong about this,
p179
aVbut my sense is that in the public mind today,
p180
aVGM is not viewed as as serious about some of these environmental ideas
p181
aVas some of your Japanese competitors, maybe even as Ford.
p182
aVAre you serious about it,
p183
aVand not just, you know, when the consumers want it,
p184
aVwhen the regulators force us to do it, we will go there?
p185
aVWill you guys really try and show leadership on this?
p186
aa(lp187
VLarry Burns: Absolutely. We're absolutely serious.
p188
aVWe're into this over a billion dollars already,
p189
aVso I would hope people would think we're serious
p190
aVwhen we're spending that kind of money.
p191
aVAnd secondly, it's a fundamental business proposition.
p192
aVI'll be honest with you;
p193
aVwe're into it for business growth opportunities.
p194
aVWe can't grow our business unless we solve these problems.
p195
aVThe growth of the auto industry will be capped by sustainability issues
p196
aVif we don't solve the problems.
p197
aVAnd there's a simple principle of strategy that says:
p198
aVDo unto yourself before others do unto you.
p199
aVIf we can see this possible future, others can, too.
p200
aVAnd we want to be the first one to create it, Chris.

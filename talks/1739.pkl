VEveryone needs a coach.
p5
aVIt doesn't matter whether you're a basketball player,
p6
aVa tennis player, a gymnast
p7
aVor a bridge player.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VMy bridge coach, Sharon Osberg,
p11
aVsays there are more pictures of the back of her head
p12
aVthan anyone else's in the world. (Laughter)
p13
aVSorry, Sharon. Here you go.
p14
aa(lp15
VWe all need people who will give us feedback.
p16
aVThat's how we improve.
p17
aVUnfortunately, there's one group of people
p18
aVwho get almost no systematic feedback
p19
aVto help them do their jobs better,
p20
aVand these people
p21
aVhave one of the most important jobs in the world.
p22
aVI'm talking about teachers.
p23
aVWhen Melinda and I learned
p24
aVhow little useful feedback most teachers get,
p25
aVwe were blown away.
p26
aVUntil recently, over 98 percent of teachers
p27
aVjust got one word of feedback:
p28
aVSatisfactory.
p29
aVIf all my bridge coach ever told me
p30
aVwas that I was "satisfactory,"
p31
aVI would have no hope of ever getting better.
p32
aVHow would I know who was the best?
p33
aVHow would I know what I was doing differently?
p34
aVToday, districts are revamping
p35
aVthe way they evaluate teachers,
p36
aVbut we still give them almost no feedback
p37
aVthat actually helps them improve their practice.
p38
aVOur teachers deserve better.
p39
aVThe system we have today isn't fair to them.
p40
aVIt's not fair to students,
p41
aVand it's putting America's global leadership at risk.
p42
aVSo today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers
p43
aVget the tools for improvement they want and deserve.
p44
aa(lp45
VLet's start by asking who's doing well.
p46
aVWell, unfortunately there's no international ranking tables
p47
aVfor teacher feedback systems.
p48
aVSo I looked at the countries
p49
aVwhose students perform well academically,
p50
aVand looked at what they're doing
p51
aVto help their teachers improve.
p52
aVConsider the rankings for reading proficiency.
p53
aVThe U.S. isn't number one.
p54
aVWe're not even in the top 10.
p55
aVWe're tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland.
p56
aVNow, out of all the places
p57
aVthat do better than the U.S. in reading,
p58
aVhow many of them have a formal system
p59
aVfor helping teachers improve?
p60
aVEleven out of 14.
p61
aVThe U.S. is tied for 15th in reading,
p62
aVbut we're 23rd in science and 31st in math.
p63
aVSo there's really only one area where we're near the top,
p64
aVand that's in failing to give our teachers
p65
aVthe help they need to develop their skills.
p66
aa(lp67
VLet's look at the best academic performer:
p68
aVthe province of Shanghai, China.
p69
aVNow, they rank number one across the board,
p70
aVin reading, math and science,
p71
aVand one of the keys to Shanghai's incredible success
p72
aVis the way they help teachers keep improving.
p73
aVThey made sure that younger teachers
p74
aVget a chance to watch master teachers at work.
p75
aVThey have weekly study groups,
p76
aVwhere teachers get together and talk about what's working.
p77
aVThey even require each teacher to observe
p78
aVand give feedback to their colleagues.
p79
aa(lp80
VYou might ask, why is a system like this so important?
p81
aVIt's because there's so much variation
p82
aVin the teaching profession.
p83
aVSome teachers are far more effective than others.
p84
aVIn fact, there are teachers throughout the country
p85
aVwho are helping their students make extraordinary gains.
p86
aVIf today's average teacher
p87
aVcould become as good as those teachers,
p88
aVour students would be blowing away the rest of the world.
p89
aVSo we need a system that helps all our teachers
p90
aVbe as good as the best.
p91
aa(lp92
VWhat would that system look like?
p93
aVWell, to find out, our foundation
p94
aVhas been working with 3,000 teachers
p95
aVin districts across the country
p96
aVon a project called Measures of Effective Teaching.
p97
aVWe had observers watch videos
p98
aVof teachers in the classroom
p99
aVand rate how they did on a range of practices.
p100
aVFor example, did they ask their students
p101
aVchallenging questions?
p102
aVDid they find multiple ways to explain an idea?
p103
aVWe also had students fill out surveys with questions like,
p104
aV"Does your teacher know
p105
aVwhen the class understands a lesson?"
p106
aV"Do you learn to correct your mistakes?"
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd what we found is very exciting.
p109
aVFirst, the teachers who did well on these observations
p110
aVhad far better student outcomes.
p111
aVSo it tells us we're asking the right questions.
p112
aVAnd second, teachers in the program told us
p113
aVthat these videos and these surveys from the students
p114
aVwere very helpful diagnostic tools,
p115
aVbecause they pointed to specific places
p116
aVwhere they can improve.
p117
aVI want to show you what this video component of MET
p118
aVlooks like in action.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Music)
p121
aa(lp122
V(Video) Sarah Brown Wessling: Good morning everybody.
p123
aVLet's talk about what's going on today.
p124
aVTo get started, we're doing a peer review day, okay?
p125
aVA peer review day, and our goal by the end of class
p126
aVis for you to be able to determine
p127
aVwhether or not you have moves to prove in your essays.
p128
aa(lp129
VMy name is Sarah Brown Wessling.
p130
aVI am a high school English teacher
p131
aVat Johnston High School in Johnston, Iowa.
p132
aa(lp133
VTurn to somebody next to you.
p134
aVTell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove. I've talk about \u2014
p135
aa(lp136
VI think that there is a difference for teachers
p137
aVbetween the abstract of how we see our practice
p138
aVand then the concrete reality of it.
p139
aa(lp140
VOkay, so I would like you to please bring up your papers.
p141
aa(lp142
VI think what video offers for us
p143
aVis a certain degree of reality.
p144
aVYou can't really dispute what you see on the video,
p145
aVand there is a lot to be learned from that,
p146
aVand there are a lot of ways that we can grow
p147
aVas a profession when we actually get to see this.
p148
aVI just have a flip camera and a little tripod
p149
aVand invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens.
p150
aVAt the beginning of class, I just perch it
p151
aVin the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot.
p152
aVIt doesn't catch every little thing that's going on.
p153
aVBut I can hear the sound. I can see a lot.
p154
aVAnd I'm able to learn a lot from it.
p155
aVSo it really has been a simple
p156
aVbut powerful tool in my own reflection.
p157
aa(lp158
VAll right, let's take a look at the long one first, okay?
p159
aa(lp160
VOnce I'm finished taping, then I put it in my computer,
p161
aVand then I'll scan it and take a peek at it.
p162
aVIf I don't write things down, I don't remember them.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo having the notes is a part of my thinking process,
p165
aVand I discover what I'm seeing as I'm writing.
p166
aVI really have used it for my own personal growth
p167
aVand my own personal reflection on teaching strategy
p168
aVand methodology and classroom management,
p169
aVand just all of those different facets of the classroom.
p170
aa(lp171
VI'm glad that we've actually done the process before
p172
aVso we can kind of compare what works, what doesn't.
p173
aa(lp174
VI think that video exposes
p175
aVso much of what's intrinsic to us as teachers
p176
aVin ways that help us learn and help us understand,
p177
aVand then help our broader communities understand
p178
aVwhat this complex work is really all about.
p179
aVI think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate
p180
aVthings that we cannot convey in a lesson plan,
p181
aVthings you cannot convey in a standard,
p182
aVthings that you cannot even sometimes convey
p183
aVin a book of pedagogy.
p184
aa(lp185
VAlrighty, everybody, have a great weekend.
p186
aVI'll see you later.
p187
aa(lp188
V[Every classroom could look like that]
p189
aa(lp190
V(Applause)
p191
aa(lp192
VBill Gates: One day, we'd like every classroom in America
p193
aVto look something like that.
p194
aVBut we still have more work to do.
p195
aVDiagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve
p196
aVis only half the battle.
p197
aVWe also have to give them the tools they need
p198
aVto act on the diagnosis.
p199
aVIf you learn that you need to improve
p200
aVthe way you teach fractions,
p201
aVyou should be able to watch a video
p202
aVof the best person in the world teaching fractions.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo building this complete teacher feedback
p205
aVand improvement system won't be easy.
p206
aVFor example, I know some teachers
p207
aVaren't immediately comfortable with the idea
p208
aVof a camera in the classroom.
p209
aVThat's understandable, but our experience with MET
p210
aVsuggests that if teachers manage the process,
p211
aVif they collect video in their own classrooms,
p212
aVand they pick the lessons they want to submit,
p213
aVa lot of them will be eager to participate.
p214
aa(lp215
VBuilding this system will also require
p216
aVa considerable investment.
p217
aVOur foundation estimates that it could cost
p218
aVup to five billion dollars.
p219
aVNow that's a big number, but to put it in perspective,
p220
aVit's less than two percent
p221
aVof what we spend every year on teacher salaries.
p222
aa(lp223
VThe impact for teachers would be phenomenal.
p224
aVWe would finally have a way to give them feedback,
p225
aVas well as the means to act on it.
p226
aa(lp227
VBut this system would have
p228
aVan even more important benefit for our country.
p229
aVIt would put us on a path to making sure
p230
aVall our students get a great education,
p231
aVfind a career that's fulfilling and rewarding,
p232
aVand have a chance to live out their dreams.
p233
aVThis wouldn't just make us a more successful country.
p234
aVIt would also make us a more fair and just one, too.
p235
aa(lp236
VI'm excited about the opportunity
p237
aVto give all our teachers the support they want and deserve.
p238
aVI hope you are too.
p239
aa(lp240
VThank you.

Microsoft. A geek icon, tech visionary and business trailblazer, Gates&#39; leadership -- fueled by his long-held dream that <strong>millions might realize their potential through great software</strong> -- made Microsoft a personal computing powerhouse and a trendsetter in the Internet dawn. Whether you&#39;re a suit, chef, quant, artist, media maven, nurse or gamer, you&#39;ve probably used a Microsoft product today.<br /><br />In summer of 2008, Gates left his day-to-day role with Microsoft to focus on philanthropy. Holding that <strong>all lives have equal value (no matter where they&#39;re being lived)</strong>, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has now donated staggering sums to HIV/AIDS programs, libraries, agriculture research and disaster relief -- and offered vital guidance and creative funding to programs in global health and education. Gates believes his tech-centric strategy for giving will prove the killer app of planet Earth&#39;s next big upgrade. </p><p>Read a collection of Bill and Melinda Gates&#39; <a href=\\"http://annualletter.gatesfoundation.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">annual letters</a>, where they take stock of the Gates Foundation and the world.

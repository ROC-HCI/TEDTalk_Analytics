VFive years ago, I was on a sabbatical,
p5
aVand I returned to the medical university
p6
aVwhere I studied.
p7
aVI saw real patients and I wore the white coat
p8
aVfor the first time in 17 years,
p9
aVin fact since I became a management consultant.
p10
aa(lp11
VThere were two things that surprised me
p12
aVduring the month I spent.
p13
aVThe first one was that the common theme
p14
aVof the discussions we had were hospital budgets
p15
aVand cost-cutting,
p16
aVand the second thing, which really bothered me,
p17
aVactually, was that several of the colleagues I met,
p18
aVformer friends from medical school,
p19
aVwho I knew to be some of the smartest,
p20
aVmost motivated, engaged and passionate people
p21
aVI'd ever met,
p22
aVmany of them had turned cynical, disengaged,
p23
aVor had distanced themselves from hospital management.
p24
aVSo with this focus on cost-cutting,
p25
aVI asked myself, are we forgetting the patient?
p26
aa(lp27
VMany countries that you represent
p28
aVand where I come from
p29
aVstruggle with the cost of healthcare.
p30
aVIt's a big part of the national budgets.
p31
aVAnd many different reforms aim at holding back this growth.
p32
aVIn some countries, we have long waiting times
p33
aVfor patients for surgery.
p34
aVIn other countries, new drugs are not being reimbursed,
p35
aVand therefore don't reach patients.
p36
aVIn several countries, doctors and nurses
p37
aVare the targets, to some extent, for the governments.
p38
aVAfter all, the costly decisions in health care
p39
aVare taken by doctors and nurses.
p40
aVYou choose an expensive lab test,
p41
aVyou choose to operate on an old and frail patient.
p42
aVSo, by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians,
p43
aVthis is a way to hold costs down.
p44
aVAnd ultimately, some physicians will say today
p45
aVthat they don't have the full liberty
p46
aVto make the choices they think are right for their patients.
p47
aVSo no wonder that some of my old colleagues
p48
aVare frustrated.
p49
aa(lp50
VAt BCG, we looked at this,
p51
aVand we asked ourselves,
p52
aVthis can't be the right way of managing healthcare.
p53
aVAnd so we took a step back and we said,
p54
aV"What is it that we are trying to achieve?"
p55
aVUltimately, in the healthcare system,
p56
aVwe're aiming at improving health for the patients,
p57
aVand we need to do so at a limited,
p58
aVor affordable, cost.
p59
aVWe call this value-based healthcare.
p60
aVOn the screen behind me, you see what we mean
p61
aVby value:
p62
aVoutcomes that matter to patients
p63
aVrelative to the money we spend.
p64
aVThis was described beautifully in a book in 2006
p65
aVby Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg.
p66
aa(lp67
VOn this picture, you have my father-in-law
p68
aVsurrounded by his three beautiful daughters.
p69
aVWhen we started doing our research at BCG,
p70
aVwe decided not to look so much at the costs,
p71
aVbut to look at the quality instead,
p72
aVand in the research, one of the things
p73
aVthat fascinated us was the variation we saw.
p74
aVYou compare hospitals in a country,
p75
aVyou'll find some that are extremely good,
p76
aVbut you'll find a large number that are vastly much worse.
p77
aVThe differences were dramatic.
p78
aVErik, my father-in-law,
p79
aVhe suffers from prostate cancer,
p80
aVand he probably needs surgery.
p81
aVNow living in Europe, he can choose to go to Germany
p82
aVthat has a well-reputed healthcare system.
p83
aVIf he goes there and goes to the average hospital,
p84
aVhe will have the risk of becoming incontinent
p85
aVby about 50 percent,
p86
aVso he would have to start wearing diapers again.
p87
aVYou flip a coin. Fifty percent risk. That's quite a lot.
p88
aVIf he instead would go to Hamburg,
p89
aVand to a clinic called the Martini-Klinik,
p90
aVthe risk would be only one in 20.
p91
aVEither you a flip a coin,
p92
aVor you have a one in 20 risk.
p93
aVThat's a huge difference, a seven-fold difference.
p94
aVWhen we look at many hospitals
p95
aVfor many different diseases,
p96
aVwe see these huge differences.
p97
aa(lp98
VBut you and I don't know. We don't have the data.
p99
aVAnd often, the data actually doesn't exist.
p100
aVNobody knows.
p101
aVSo going the hospital is a lottery.
p102
aa(lp103
VNow, it doesn't have to be that way. There is hope.
p104
aVIn the late '70s, there were a group
p105
aVof Swedish orthopedic surgeons
p106
aVwho met at their annual meeting,
p107
aVand they were discussing the different procedures
p108
aVthey used to operate hip surgery.
p109
aVTo the left of this slide, you see a variety
p110
aVof metal pieces, artificial hips that you would use
p111
aVfor somebody who needs a new hip.
p112
aVThey all realized they had their individual way of operating.
p113
aVThey all argued that, "My technique is the best,"
p114
aVbut none of them actually knew, and they admitted that.
p115
aVSo they said, "We probably need to measure quality
p116
aVso we know and can learn from what's best."
p117
aVSo they in fact spent two years debating,
p118
aV"So what is quality in hip surgery?"
p119
aV"Oh, we should measure this." "No, we should measure that."
p120
aVAnd they finally agreed.
p121
aVAnd once they had agreed, they started measuring,
p122
aVand started sharing the data.
p123
aVVery quickly, they found that if you put cement
p124
aVin the bone of the patient
p125
aVbefore you put the metal shaft in,
p126
aVit actually lasted a lot longer,
p127
aVand most patients would never have to be
p128
aVre-operated on in their lifetime.
p129
aVThey published the data,
p130
aVand it actually transformed clinical practice in the country.
p131
aVEverybody saw this makes a lot of sense.
p132
aVSince then, they publish every year.
p133
aVOnce a year, they publish the league table:
p134
aVwho's best, who's at the bottom?
p135
aVAnd they visit each other to try to learn,
p136
aVso a continuous cycle of improvement.
p137
aVFor many years, Swedish hip surgeons
p138
aVhad the best results in the world,
p139
aVat least for those who actually were measuring,
p140
aVand many were not.
p141
aa(lp142
VNow I found this principle really exciting.
p143
aVSo the physicians get together,
p144
aVthey agree on what quality is,
p145
aVthey start measuring, they share the data,
p146
aVthey find who's best, and they learn from it.
p147
aVContinuous improvement.
p148
aa(lp149
VNow, that's not the only exciting part.
p150
aVThat's exciting in itself.
p151
aVBut if you bring back the cost side of the equation,
p152
aVand look at that,
p153
aVit turns out, those who have focused on quality,
p154
aVthey actually also have the lowest costs,
p155
aValthough that's not been the purpose in the first place.
p156
aVSo if you look at the hip surgery story again,
p157
aVthere was a study done a couple years ago
p158
aVwhere they compared the U.S. and Sweden.
p159
aVThey looked at how many patients have needed
p160
aVto be re-operated on seven years after the first surgery.
p161
aVIn the United States, the number was three times
p162
aVhigher than in Sweden.
p163
aVSo many unnecessary surgeries,
p164
aVand so much unnecessary suffering
p165
aVfor all the patients who were operated on
p166
aVin that seven year period.
p167
aVNow, you can imagine how much savings
p168
aVthere would be for society.
p169
aa(lp170
VWe did a study where we looked at OECD data.
p171
aVOECD does, every so often,
p172
aVlook at quality of care
p173
aVwhere they can find the data across the member countries.
p174
aVThe United States has, for many diseases,
p175
aVactually a quality which is below the average
p176
aVin OECD.
p177
aVNow, if the American healthcare system
p178
aVwould focus a lot more on measuring quality,
p179
aVand raise quality just to the level of average OECD,
p180
aVit would save the American people
p181
aV500 billion U.S. dollars a year.
p182
aVThat's 20 percent of the budget,
p183
aVof the healthcare budget of the country.
p184
aa(lp185
VNow you may say that these numbers
p186
aVare fantastic, and it's all logical,
p187
aVbut is it possible?
p188
aVThis would be a paradigm shift in healthcare,
p189
aVand I would argue that not only can it be done,
p190
aVbut it has to be done.
p191
aVThe agents of change are the doctors and nurses
p192
aVin the healthcare system.
p193
aa(lp194
VIn my practice as a consultant,
p195
aVI meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred
p196
aVdoctors and nurses and other hospital
p197
aVor healthcare staff every year.
p198
aVThe one thing they have in common is
p199
aVthey really care about what they achieve
p200
aVin terms of quality for their patients.
p201
aVPhysicians are, like most of you in the audience,
p202
aVvery competitive.
p203
aVThey were always best in class.
p204
aVWe were always best in class.
p205
aVAnd if somebody can show them that the result
p206
aVthey perform for their patients
p207
aVis no better than what others do,
p208
aVthey will do whatever it takes to improve.
p209
aVBut most of them don't know.
p210
aVBut physicians have another characteristic.
p211
aVThey actually thrive from peer recognition.
p212
aVIf a cardiologist calls another cardiologist
p213
aVin a competing hospital
p214
aVand discusses why that other hospital
p215
aVhas so much better results, they will share.
p216
aVThey will share the information on how to improve.
p217
aVSo it is, by measuring and creating transparency,
p218
aVyou get a cycle of continuous improvement,
p219
aVwhich is what this slide shows.
p220
aa(lp221
VNow, you may say this is a nice idea,
p222
aVbut this isn't only an idea.
p223
aVThis is happening in reality.
p224
aVWe're creating a global community,
p225
aVand a large global community,
p226
aVwhere we'll be able to measure and compare
p227
aVwhat we achieve.
p228
aVTogether with two academic institutions,
p229
aVMichael Porter at Harvard Business School,
p230
aVand the Karolinska Institute in Sweden,
p231
aVBCG has formed something we call ICHOM.
p232
aVYou may think that's a sneeze,
p233
aVbut it's not a sneeze, it's an acronym.
p234
aVIt stands for the International Consortium
p235
aVfor Health Outcome Measurement.
p236
aVWe're bringing together leading physicians
p237
aVand patients to discuss, disease by disease,
p238
aVwhat is really quality,
p239
aVwhat should we measure,
p240
aVand to make those standards global.
p241
aVThey've worked \u2014 four working groups have worked
p242
aVduring the past year:
p243
aVcataracts, back pain,
p244
aVcoronary artery disease, which is, for instance, heart attack,
p245
aVand prostate cancer.
p246
aVThe four groups will publish their data
p247
aVin November of this year.
p248
aVThat's the first time we'll be comparing
p249
aVapples to apples, not only within a country,
p250
aVbut between countries.
p251
aVNext year, we're planning to do eight diseases,
p252
aVthe year after, 16.
p253
aVIn three years' time, we plan to have covered
p254
aV40 percent of the disease burden.
p255
aVCompare apples to apples. Who's better?
p256
aVWhy is that?
p257
aa(lp258
VFive months ago,
p259
aVI led a workshop at the largest university hospital
p260
aVin Northern Europe.
p261
aVThey have a new CEO, and she has a vision:
p262
aVI want to manage my big institution much more
p263
aVon quality, outcomes that matter to patients.
p264
aVThis particular day, we sat in a workshop
p265
aVtogether with physicians, nurses and other staff,
p266
aVdiscussing leukemia in children.
p267
aVThe group discussed,
p268
aVhow do we measure quality today?
p269
aVCan we measure it better than we do?
p270
aVWe discussed, how do we treat these kids,
p271
aVwhat are important improvements?
p272
aVAnd we discussed what are the costs for these patients,
p273
aVcan we do treatment more efficiently?
p274
aVThere was an enormous energy in the room.
p275
aVThere were so many ideas, so much enthusiasm.
p276
aVAt the end of the meeting,
p277
aVthe chairman of the department, he stood up.
p278
aVHe looked over the group and he said \u2014
p279
aVfirst he raised his hand, I forgot that \u2014
p280
aVhe raised his hand, clenched his fist,
p281
aVand then he said to the group, "Thank you.
p282
aVThank you. Today, we're finally discussing
p283
aVwhat this hospital does the right way."
p284
aa(lp285
VBy measuring value in healthcare,
p286
aVthat is not only costs
p287
aVbut outcomes that matter to patients,
p288
aVwe will make staff in hospitals
p289
aVand elsewhere in the healthcare system
p290
aVnot a problem but an important part of the solution.
p291
aVI believe measuring value in healthcare
p292
aVwill bring about a revolution,
p293
aVand I'm convinced that the founder
p294
aVof modern medicine, the Greek Hippocrates,
p295
aVwho always put the patient at the center,
p296
aVhe would smile in his grave.
p297
aa(lp298
VThank you.

VI grew up in Bihar, India's poorest state,
p5
aVand I remember when I was six years old,
p6
aVI remember coming home one day to find a cart
p7
aVfull of the most delicious sweets at our doorstep.
p8
aVMy brothers and I dug in,
p9
aVand that's when my father came home.
p10
aVHe was livid, and I still remember how we cried
p11
aVwhen that cart with our half-eaten sweets
p12
aVwas pulled away from us.
p13
aa(lp14
VLater, I understood why my father got so upset.
p15
aVThose sweets were a bribe
p16
aVfrom a contractor who was trying to get my father
p17
aVto award him a government contract.
p18
aVMy father was responsible for building roads in Bihar,
p19
aVand he had developed a firm stance against corruption,
p20
aVeven though he was harassed and threatened.
p21
aVHis was a lonely struggle, because Bihar
p22
aVwas also India's most corrupt state,
p23
aVwhere public officials were enriching themselves,
p24
aV[rather] than serving the poor who had no means
p25
aVto express their anguish if their children
p26
aVhad no food or no schooling.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd I experienced this most viscerally
p29
aVwhen I traveled to remote villages to study poverty.
p30
aVAnd as I went village to village,
p31
aVI remember one day, when I was famished and exhausted,
p32
aVand I was almost collapsing
p33
aVin a scorching heat under a tree,
p34
aVand just at that time, one of the poorest men in that village
p35
aVinvited me into his hut and graciously fed me.
p36
aVOnly I later realized that what he fed me
p37
aVwas food for his entire family for two days.
p38
aVThis profound gift of generosity
p39
aVchallenged and changed the very purpose of my life.
p40
aVI resolved to give back.
p41
aa(lp42
VLater, I joined the World Bank, which sought to fight
p43
aVsuch poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries.
p44
aVMy initial work focused on Uganda, where I focused
p45
aVon negotiating reforms with the Finance Ministry of Uganda
p46
aVso they could access our loans.
p47
aVBut after we disbursed the loans, I remember
p48
aVa trip in Uganda where I found newly built schools
p49
aVwithout textbooks or teachers,
p50
aVnew health clinics without drugs,
p51
aVand the poor once again without any voice or recourse.
p52
aVIt was Bihar all over again.
p53
aa(lp54
VBihar represents the challenge of development:
p55
aVabject poverty surrounded by corruption.
p56
aVGlobally, 1.3 billion people live on less than
p57
aV$1.25 a day, and the work I did in Uganda
p58
aVrepresents the traditional approach to these problems
p59
aVthat has been practiced since 1944,
p60
aVwhen winners of World War II, 500 founding fathers,
p61
aVand one lonely founding mother,
p62
aVgathered in New Hampshire, USA,
p63
aVto establish the Bretton Woods institutions,
p64
aVincluding the World Bank.
p65
aVAnd that traditional approach to development
p66
aVhad three key elements. First, transfer of resources
p67
aVfrom rich countries in the North
p68
aVto poorer countries in the South,
p69
aVaccompanied by reform prescriptions.
p70
aVSecond, the development institutions that channeled
p71
aVthese transfers were opaque, with little transparency
p72
aVof what they financed or what results they achieved.
p73
aVAnd third, the engagement in developing countries
p74
aVwas with a narrow set of government elites
p75
aVwith little interaction with the citizens, who are
p76
aVthe ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance.
p77
aa(lp78
VToday, each of these elements is opening up
p79
aVdue to dramatic changes in the global environment.
p80
aVOpen knowledge, open aid, open governance,
p81
aVand together, they represent three key shifts
p82
aVthat are transforming development
p83
aVand that also hold greater hope for the problems
p84
aVI witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar.
p85
aa(lp86
VThe first key shift is open knowledge.
p87
aVYou know, developing countries today will not simply
p88
aVaccept solutions that are handed down to them
p89
aVby the U.S., Europe or the World Bank.
p90
aVThey get their inspiration, their hope,
p91
aVtheir practical know-how,
p92
aVfrom successful emerging economies in the South.
p93
aVThey want to know how China lifted 500 million people
p94
aVout of poverty in 30 years,
p95
aVhow Mexico's Oportunidades program
p96
aVimproved schooling and nutrition for millions of children.
p97
aVThis is the new ecosystem of open-knowledge flows,
p98
aVnot just traveling North to South, but South to South,
p99
aVand even South to North,
p100
aVwith Mexico's Oportunidades today inspiring New York City.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd just as these North-to-South transfers are opening up,
p103
aVso too are the development institutions
p104
aVthat channeled these transfers.
p105
aVThis is the second shift: open aid.
p106
aVRecently, the World Bank opened its vault of data
p107
aVfor public use, releasing 8,000 economic and social indicators
p108
aVfor 200 countries over 50 years,
p109
aVand it launched a global competition to crowdsource
p110
aVinnovative apps using this data.
p111
aVDevelopment institutions today are also opening
p112
aVfor public scrutiny the projects they finance.
p113
aVTake GeoMapping. In this map from Kenya,
p114
aVthe red dots show where all the schools financed by donors
p115
aVare located, and the darker the shade of green,
p116
aVthe more the number of out-of-school children.
p117
aVSo this simple mashup reveals that donors
p118
aVhave not financed any schools in the areas
p119
aVwith the most out-of-school children,
p120
aVprovoking new questions. Is development assistance
p121
aVtargeting those who most need our help?
p122
aVIn this manner, the World Bank has now GeoMapped
p123
aV30,000 project activities in 143 countries,
p124
aVand donors are using a common platform
p125
aVto map all their projects.
p126
aVThis is a tremendous leap forward in transparency
p127
aVand accountability of aid.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd this leads me to the third, and in my view,
p130
aVthe most significant shift in development:
p131
aVopen governance. Governments today are opening up
p132
aVjust as citizens are demanding voice and accountability.
p133
aVFrom the Arab Spring to the Anna Hazare movement in India,
p134
aVusing mobile phones and social media
p135
aVnot just for political accountability
p136
aVbut also for development accountability.
p137
aVAre governments delivering services to the citizens?
p138
aVSo for instance, several governments in Africa
p139
aVand Eastern Europe are opening their budgets to the public.
p140
aa(lp141
VBut, you know, there is a big difference between a budget
p142
aVthat's public and a budget that's accessible.
p143
aVThis is a public budget. (Laughter)
p144
aVAnd as you can see, it's not really accessible
p145
aVor understandable to an ordinary citizen
p146
aVthat is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources.
p147
aVTo tackle this problem, governments are using new tools
p148
aVto visualize the budget so it's more understandable
p149
aVto the public.
p150
aVIn this map from Moldova, the green color shows
p151
aVthose districts that have low spending on schools
p152
aVbut good educational outcomes,
p153
aVand the red color shows the opposite.
p154
aVTools like this help turn a shelf full of inscrutable documents
p155
aVinto a publicly understandable visual,
p156
aVand what's exciting is that with this openness,
p157
aVthere are today new opportunities for citizens
p158
aVto give feedback and engage with government.
p159
aVSo in the Philippines today, parents and students
p160
aVcan give real-time feedback on a website,
p161
aVCheckmyschool.org, or using SMS, whether teachers
p162
aVand textbooks are showing up in school,
p163
aVthe same problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar.
p164
aVAnd the government is responsive. So for instance,
p165
aVwhen it was reported on this website that 800 students
p166
aVwere at risk because school repairs had stalled
p167
aVdue to corruption, the Department of Education
p168
aVin the Philippines took swift action.
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd you know what's exciting is that this innovation
p171
aVis now spreading South to South, from the Philippines
p172
aVto Indonesia, Kenya, Moldova and beyond.
p173
aVIn Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, even an impoverished
p174
aVcommunity was able to use these tools
p175
aVto voice its aspirations.
p176
aVThis is what the map of Tandale looked like
p177
aVin August, 2011. But within a few weeks,
p178
aVuniversity students were able to use mobile phones
p179
aVand an open-source platform to dramatically map
p180
aVthe entire community infrastructure.
p181
aVAnd what is very exciting is that citizens were then
p182
aVable to give feedback as to which health or water points
p183
aVwere not working, aggregated
p184
aVin the red bubbles that you see,
p185
aVwhich together provides a graphic visual
p186
aVof the collective voices of the poor.
p187
aVToday, even Bihar is turning around and opening up
p188
aVunder a committed leadership that is making government
p189
aVtransparent, accessible and responsive to the poor.
p190
aa(lp191
VBut, you know, in many parts of the world,
p192
aVgovernments are not interested in opening up
p193
aVor in serving the poor, and it is a real challenge
p194
aVfor those who want to change the system.
p195
aVThese are the lonely warriors
p196
aVlike my father and many, many others,
p197
aVand a key frontier of development work
p198
aVis to help these lonely warriors join hands
p199
aVso they can together overcome the odds.
p200
aVSo for instance, today, in Ghana, courageous reformers
p201
aVfrom civil society, Parliament and government,
p202
aVhave forged a coalition for transparent contracts
p203
aVin the oil sector, and, galvanized by this,
p204
aVreformers in Parliament are now investigating dubious contracts.
p205
aVThese examples give new hope, new possibility
p206
aVto the problems I witnessed in Uganda
p207
aVor that my father confronted in Bihar.
p208
aa(lp209
VTwo years ago, on April 8th, 2010, I called my father.
p210
aVIt was very late at night, and at age 80,
p211
aVhe was typing a 70-page public interest litigation
p212
aVagainst corruption in a road project.
p213
aVThough he was no lawyer, he argued the case in court
p214
aVhimself the next day. He won the ruling,
p215
aVbut later that very evening,
p216
aVhe fell, and he died.
p217
aVHe fought till the end, increasingly passionate
p218
aVthat to combat corruption and poverty,
p219
aVnot only did government officials need to be honest,
p220
aVbut citizens needed to join together
p221
aVto make their voices heard.
p222
aVThese became the two bookends of his life,
p223
aVand the journey he traveled in between
p224
aVmirrored the changing development landscape.
p225
aa(lp226
VToday, I'm inspired by these changes, and I'm excited
p227
aVthat at the World Bank, we are embracing
p228
aVthese new directions, a significant departure
p229
aVfrom my work in Uganda 20 years ago.
p230
aVWe need to radically open up development
p231
aVso knowledge flows in multiple directions,
p232
aVinspiring practitioners, so aid becomes transparent,
p233
aVaccountable and effective, so governments open up
p234
aVand citizens are engaged and empowered
p235
aVwith reformers in government.
p236
aVWe need to accelerate these shifts.
p237
aVIf we do, we will find that the collective voices
p238
aVof the poor will be heard in Bihar,
p239
aVin Uganda, and beyond.
p240
aVWe will find that textbooks and teachers
p241
aVwill show up in schools for their children.
p242
aVWe will find that these children, too,
p243
aVhave a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty.
p244
aVThank you. (Applause)
p245
aV(Applause)

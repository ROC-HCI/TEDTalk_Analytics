VWell, good afternoon.
p5
aVHow many of you
p6
aVtook the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge?
p7
aV(Applause)
p8
aVWoo hoo!
p9
aVWell, I have to tell you, from  the bottom of our hearts,
p10
aVthank you so very, very much.
p11
aVDo you know to date the ALS Association
p12
aVhas raised 125 million dollars?
p13
aVWoo hoo! (Applause)
p14
aa(lp15
VIt takes me back to the summer of 2011.
p16
aVMy family, my kids had all grown up.
p17
aVWe were officially empty nesters,
p18
aVand we decided, let's  go on a family vacation.
p19
aVJenn, my daughter, and my son-in-law
p20
aVcame down from New York.
p21
aVMy youngest, Andrew,
p22
aVhe came down from his home in Charlestown
p23
aVwhere he was working in Boston,
p24
aVand my son Pete,
p25
aVwho had played at  Boston College, baseball,
p26
aVhad played baseball  professionally in Europe,
p27
aVand had now come home and was selling group insurance, he also joined us.
p28
aVAnd one night, I found myself
p29
aVhaving a beer with Pete,
p30
aVand Pete was looking at  me and he just said,
p31
aV"You know, Mom, I don't know,
p32
aVselling group insurance  is just not my passion."
p33
aVHe said, "I just don't feel  I'm living up to my potential.
p34
aVI don't feel this is my mission in life."
p35
aVAnd he said, "You know,  oh by the way, Mom,
p36
aVI have to leave early from vacation
p37
aVbecause my inter-city league team  that I play for made the playoffs,
p38
aVand I have to get back to Boston  because I can't let my team down.
p39
aVI'm just not as passionate about my job
p40
aVas I am about baseball."
p41
aa(lp42
VSo off Pete went, and  left the family vacation \u2014
p43
aVbreak a mother's heart \u2014
p44
aVand he went, and we  followed four days later
p45
aVto see the next playoff game.
p46
aVWe're at the playoff game,  Pete's at the plate,
p47
aVand a fastball's coming in,
p48
aVand it hits him on the wrist.
p49
aVOh, Pete.
p50
aVHis wrist went completely limp, like this.
p51
aVSo for the next six months,
p52
aVPete went back to his home in Southie,
p53
aVkept working that unpassionate job,
p54
aVand was going to doctors
p55
aVto see what was wrong with this wrist
p56
aVthat never came back.
p57
aa(lp58
VSix months later, in March,
p59
aVhe called my husband  and me, and he said,
p60
aV"Oh, Mom and Dad, we have a doctor
p61
aVthat found a diagnosis for that wrist.
p62
aVDo you want to come with the doctor's appointment with me?"
p63
aVI said, "Sure, we'll come in."
p64
aVThat morning, Pete, John and I
p65
aVall got up, got dressed, got in our cars \u2014
p66
aVthree separate cars
p67
aVbecause we were going to go to work
p68
aVafter the doctor's appointment to find out what happened to the wrist.
p69
aVWe walked into the  neurologist's office, sat down,
p70
aVfour doctors walk in,
p71
aVand the head neurologist sits down.
p72
aVAnd he says, "Well, Pete, we've been looking at all the tests,
p73
aVand I have to tell you,  it's not a sprained wrist,
p74
aVit's not a broken wrist,
p75
aVit's not nerve damage in the wrist,
p76
aVit's not an infection,
p77
aVit's not Lyme disease."
p78
aVAnd there was this deliberate  elimination going up,
p79
aVand I was thinking to myself,
p80
aVwhere is he going with this?
p81
aVThen he put his hands on his knees,
p82
aVhe looked right at my  27-year-old kid, and said,
p83
aV"I don't know how to  tell a 27-year-old this:
p84
aVPete, you have ALS."
p85
aVALS?
p86
aVI had had a friend whose  80-year-old father had ALS.
p87
aVI looked at my husband, he looked at me,
p88
aVand then we looked at the  doctor, and we said, "ALS?
p89
aVOkay, what treatment? Let's go.
p90
aVWhat do we do? Let's go."
p91
aVAnd he looked at us, and he said, "Mr. and Mrs. Frates,
p92
aVI'm sorry to tell you this,
p93
aVbut there's no treatment  and there's no cure."
p94
aVWe were the worst culprits.
p95
aVWe didn't even understand
p96
aVthat it had been 75 years since Lou Gehrig
p97
aVand nothing had been done  in the progress against ALS.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo we all went home, and Jenn and Dan
p100
aVflew home from Wall Street,
p101
aVAndrew came home from Charlestown,
p102
aVand Pete went to B.C. to pick up
p103
aVhis then-girlfriend Julie  and brought her home,
p104
aVand six hours later after diagnosis,
p105
aVwe're sitting around  having a family dinner,
p106
aVand we're having small chat.
p107
aVI don't even remember  cooking dinner that night.
p108
aVBut then our leader, Pete, set the vision,
p109
aVand talked to us just like  we were his new team.
p110
aVHe said, "There will be  no wallowing, people."
p111
aVHe goes, "We're not looking back,
p112
aVwe're looking forward.
p113
aVWhat an amazing opportunity  we have to change the world.
p114
aVI'm going to change the face
p115
aVof this unacceptable situation of ALS.
p116
aVWe're going to move the needle,
p117
aVand I'm going to get it in front of philanthropists like Bill Gates."
p118
aVAnd that was it. We  were given our directive.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo in the days and months that followed,
p121
aVwithin a week, we had  our brothers and sisters
p122
aVand our family come to us,
p123
aVthat they were already  creating Team Frate Train.
p124
aVUncle Dave, he was the webmaster;
p125
aVUncle Artie, he was the accountant;
p126
aVAuntie Dana, she was the graphic artist;
p127
aVand my youngest son, Andrew,
p128
aVquit his job, left his  apartment in Charlestown
p129
aVand says, "I'm going to take care  of Pete and be his caregiver."
p130
aVThen all those people,  classmates, teammates,
p131
aVcoworkers that Pete had inspired
p132
aVthroughout his whole life,
p133
aVthe circles of Pete all started intersecting with one another,
p134
aVand made Team Frate Train.
p135
aa(lp136
VSix months after diagnosis,
p137
aVPete was given an award at a  research summit for advocacy.
p138
aVHe got up and gave a very eloquent speech,
p139
aVand at the end of the  speech, there was a panel,
p140
aVand on the panel were these pharmaceutical executives
p141
aVand biochemists and clinicians
p142
aVand I'm sitting there and  I'm listening to them
p143
aVand most of the content  went straight over my head.
p144
aVI avoided every science  class I ever could.
p145
aVBut I was watching these people, and I was listening to them,
p146
aVand they were saying,  "I, I do this, I do that,"
p147
aVand there was a real  unfamiliarity between them.
p148
aVSo at the end of their talk, the panel,
p149
aVthey had questions and answers,
p150
aVand boom, my hand went right up,
p151
aVand I get the microphone,
p152
aVand I look at them and I say, "Thank you.
p153
aVThank you so much for working in ALS.
p154
aVIt means so very much to us."
p155
aVI said, "But I do have to tell you
p156
aVthat I'm watching your body language
p157
aVand I'm listening to what you're saying.
p158
aVIt just doesn't seem like there's a whole  lot of collaboration going on here.
p159
aVAnd not only that, where's the flip chart
p160
aVwith the action items and the  follow-up and the accountability?
p161
aVWhat are you going to do  after you leave this room?"
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd then I turned around
p164
aVand there was about 200 pairs  of eyes just staring at me.
p165
aVAnd it was that point that I realized
p166
aVthat I had talked about  the elephant in the room.
p167
aVThus my mission had begun.
p168
aVSo over the next couple of years,
p169
aVPete \u2014 we've had our highs and our lows.
p170
aVPete was put on a compassionate use drug.
p171
aVIt was hope in a bottle for  the whole ALS community.
p172
aVIt was in a phase III trial.
p173
aVThen six months later, the  data comes back: no efficacy.
p174
aVWe were supposed to  have therapies overseas,
p175
aVand the rug was  pulled out from under us.
p176
aVSo for the next two years,
p177
aVwe just watched my son  be taken away from me,
p178
aVlittle by little every day.
p179
aVTwo and a half years ago,
p180
aVPete was hitting home  runs at baseball fields.
p181
aVToday, Pete's completely paralyzed.
p182
aVHe can't hold his head up any longer.
p183
aVHe's confined to a motorized wheelchair.
p184
aVHe can no longer swallow or eat.
p185
aVHe has a feeding tube.
p186
aVHe can't speak.
p187
aVHe talks with eye gaze technology
p188
aVand a speech generating device,
p189
aVand we're watching his lungs,
p190
aVbecause his diaphragm  eventually is going to give out
p191
aVand then the decision will be made to put him on a ventilator or not.
p192
aVALS robs the human of all their physical  parts, but the brain stays intact.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo July 4th, 2014,
p195
aV75th year of Lou Gehrig's  inspirational speech comes,
p196
aVand Pete is asked by MLB.com to write an article in the Bleacher Report.
p197
aVAnd it was very significant, because he  wrote it using his eye gaze technology.
p198
aa(lp199
VTwenty days later,  the ice started to fall.
p200
aVOn July 27th, Pete's  roommate in New York City,
p201
aVwearing a Quinn For The Win shirt,
p202
aVsignifying Pat Quinn, another  ALS patient known in New York,
p203
aVand B.C. shorts
p204
aVsaid, "I'm taking the ALS  Ice Bucket Challenge,"
p205
aVpicked up the ice, put it over his head.
p206
aV"And I'm nominating ..."  And he sent it up to Boston.
p207
aVAnd that was on July 27th.
p208
aVOver the next couple  of days, our news feed
p209
aVwas full of family and friends.
p210
aVIf you haven't gone back, the nice thing about Facebook
p211
aVis that you have the dates, you can go back.
p212
aVYou've got to see Uncle Artie's  human Bloody Mary.
p213
aVI'm telling you, it's one of the best ones,
p214
aVand that was probably in day two.
p215
aVBy about day four, Uncle  Dave, the webmaster,
p216
aVhe isn't on Facebook,
p217
aVand I get a text from him,  and it says, "Nancy,
p218
aVwhat the hell is going on?"
p219
aVUncle Dave gets a hit  every time Pete's website
p220
aVis gone onto, and his  phone was blowing up.
p221
aVSo we all sat down and we realized,
p222
aVmoney is coming in \u2014 how amazing.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo we knew awareness  would lead to funding,
p225
aVwe just didn't know it would only take a couple of days.
p226
aVSo we got together, put our best  501(c)(3)s on Pete's website,
p227
aVand off we went.
p228
aVSo week one, Boston media.
p229
aVWeek two, national media.
p230
aVIt was during week two  that our neighbor next door
p231
aVopened up our door and threw a pizza
p232
aVacross the kitchen floor, saying,
p233
aV"I think you people might  need food in there."
p234
aV(Laughter)
p235
aVWeek three, celebrities \u2014  Entertainment Tonight,
p236
aVAccess Hollywood.
p237
aVWeek four, global \u2014 BBC, Irish Radio.
p238
aVDid anyone see "Lost In Translation"?
p239
aVMy husband did Japanese television.
p240
aVIt was interesting.
p241
aV(Laughter)
p242
aVAnd those videos, the popular ones.
p243
aVPaul Bissonnette's  glacier video, incredible.
p244
aVHow about the redemption nuns of Dublin?
p245
aVWho's seen that one?
p246
aVIt's absolutely fantastic.
p247
aVJ.T., Justin Timberlake.
p248
aVThat's when we knew, that  was a real A-list celebrity.
p249
aVI go back on my texts, and I can see
p250
aV"JT! JT!" My sister texting me.
p251
aVAngela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany.
p252
aVIncredible.
p253
aVAnd the ALS patients,
p254
aVyou know what their favorite ones are, and their families'?
p255
aVAll of them.
p256
aVBecause this misunderstood and  underfunded "rare" disease,
p257
aVthey just sat and watched people  saying it over and over: "ALS, ALS."
p258
aVIt was unbelievable.
p259
aa(lp260
VAnd those naysayers,
p261
aVlet's just talk a couple  of stats, shall we?
p262
aVOkay, so the ALS Association,
p263
aVthey think by year end, it'll be 160 million dollars.
p264
aVALS TDI in Cambridge,
p265
aVthey raised three million dollars.
p266
aVWell, guess what?
p267
aVThey had a clinical trial for a drug that they've been developing.
p268
aVIt was on a three-year track for funding.
p269
aVTwo months.
p270
aVIt's coming out starting in two months.
p271
aV(Applause)
p272
aVAnd YouTube has reported
p273
aVthat over 150 countries have posted Ice Bucket Challenges for ALS.
p274
aVAnd Facebook, 2.5 million videos,
p275
aVand I had the awesome adventure
p276
aVvisiting the Facebook campus last week,
p277
aVand I said to them, "I know what it was like in my house.
p278
aVI can't imagine what it  was like around here."
p279
aVAll she said was, "Jaw-dropping."
p280
aa(lp281
VAnd my family's favorite video?
p282
aVBill Gates.
p283
aVBecause the night Pete was diagnosed,
p284
aVhe told us that he was going to get ALS in front of philanthropists like Bill Gates,
p285
aVand he did it.
p286
aVGoal number one, check.
p287
aVNow on to the treatment and cure.
p288
aV(Applause)
p289
aa(lp290
VSo okay, after all of this ice,
p291
aVwe know that it was much more
p292
aVthan just pouring buckets of  ice water over your head,
p293
aVand I really would like to leave you
p294
aVwith a couple of things that  I'd like you to remember.
p295
aVThe first thing is,
p296
aVevery morning when you wake up,
p297
aVyou can choose to live your day in positivity.
p298
aVWould any of you blame me
p299
aVif I just was in the fetal position
p300
aVand pulled the covers  over my head every day?
p301
aVNo, I don't think anybody would blame me,
p302
aVbut Pete has inspired us to wake up
p303
aVevery morning and be  positive and proactive.
p304
aVI actually had to ditch support groups
p305
aVbecause everybody was in there saying that
p306
aVspraying their lawns with chemicals,
p307
aVthat's why they got ALS,
p308
aVand I was like, "I don't think so,"
p309
aVbut I had to get away from the negativity.
p310
aa(lp311
VThe second thing I want to leave you with
p312
aVis the person at the  middle of the challenge
p313
aVhas to be willing to have  the mental toughness
p314
aVto put themselves out there.
p315
aVPete still goes to baseball games
p316
aVand he still sits with his  teammates in the dugout,
p317
aVand he hangs his gravity feed bag
p318
aVright on the cages.
p319
aVYou'll see the kids, they're  up there hanging it up.
p320
aV"Pete, is that okay?" "Yup."
p321
aVAnd then they put it  right into his stomach.
p322
aVBecause he wants them to see what the reality of this is,
p323
aVand how he's never, ever going to give up.
p324
aa(lp325
VAnd the third thing I  want to leave you with:
p326
aVIf you ever come across a situation
p327
aVthat you see as so unacceptable,
p328
aVI want you to dig down as deep as you can
p329
aVand find your best mother bear
p330
aVand go after it.
p331
aV(Applause)
p332
aVThank you.
p333
aV(Applause)
p334
aa(lp335
VI know that I'm running over,
p336
aVbut I've got to leave you with this:
p337
aVthe gifts that my son has given me.
p338
aVI have had 29 years
p339
aVof having the honor of being the mother
p340
aVof Pete Frates.
p341
aVPete Frates has been inspiring  and leading his whole life.
p342
aVHe's thrown out kindness,
p343
aVand all that kindness  has come back to him.
p344
aVHe walks the face of the Earth  right now and knows why he's here.
p345
aVWhat a gift.
p346
aa(lp347
VThe second thing that my son has given me
p348
aVis he's given me my mission in life.
p349
aVNow I know why I'm here.
p350
aVI'm going to save my son,
p351
aVand if it doesn't happen in time for him,
p352
aVI'm going to work so that no other mother
p353
aVhas to go through what I'm going through.
p354
aa(lp355
VAnd the third thing,  and last but not least
p356
aVgift that my son has given me,
p357
aVas an exclamation point
p358
aVto the miraculous month
p359
aVof August 2014:
p360
aVThat girlfriend that he went to get on  the night of diagnosis is now his wife,
p361
aVand Pete and Julie have given me my  granddaughter, Lucy Fitzgerald Frates.
p362
aVLucy Fitzgerald Frates came two weeks early
p363
aVas the exclamation point
p364
aVon August 31st, 2014.
p365
aa(lp366
VAnd so \u2014
p367
aV(Applause) \u2014
p368
aVAnd so let me leave you with  Pete's words of inspiration
p369
aVthat he would use to classmates, coworkers and teammates.
p370
aVBe passionate.
p371
aVBe genuine.
p372
aVBe hardworking.
p373
aVAnd don't forget to be great.
p374
aa(lp375
VThank you. (Applause)

Pete was a 27-year-old athlete and the only people she&rsquo;d ever known with this disease were elderly already. Ever since that life-changing moment, she and her family have found their sense of purpose in working tirelessly to raise awareness about ALS and to stimulate funding for research. Because it&rsquo;s been 75 years since Lou Gehrig delivered his famed farewell speech, and no treatment or cure has been found.

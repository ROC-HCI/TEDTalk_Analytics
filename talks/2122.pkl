VI grew up
p5
aVdiagnosed as phobically shy,
p6
aVand, like at least 20 other people
p7
aVin a room of this size,
p8
aVI was a stutterer.
p9
aVDo you dare raise your hand?
p10
aa(lp11
VAnd it sticks with us. It really does stick with us,
p12
aVbecause when we are treated that way,
p13
aVwe feel invisible sometimes,
p14
aVor talked around and at.
p15
aVAnd as I started to look at people,
p16
aVwhich is mostly all I did,
p17
aVI noticed that some people
p18
aVreally wanted attention and recognition.
p19
aVRemember, I was young then.
p20
aVSo what did they do?
p21
aVWhat we still do perhaps too often.
p22
aVWe talk about ourselves.
p23
aVAnd yet there are other people I observed
p24
aVwho had what I called a mutuality mindset.
p25
aVIn each situation, they found a way to talk about us
p26
aVand create that "us" idea.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo my idea to reimagine the world
p29
aVis to see it one where we all become
p30
aVgreater opportunity-makers with and for others.
p31
aVThere's no greater opportunity
p32
aVor call for action for us now
p33
aVthan to become opportunity-makers
p34
aVwho use best talents together more often
p35
aVfor the greater good
p36
aVand accomplish things we couldn't have done on our own.
p37
aVAnd I want to talk to you about that,
p38
aVbecause even more than giving,
p39
aVeven more than giving,
p40
aVis the capacity for us to do something smarter
p41
aVtogether for the greater good
p42
aVthat lifts us both up
p43
aVand that can scale.
p44
aVThat's why I'm sitting here.
p45
aVBut I also want to point something else out:
p46
aVEach one of you
p47
aVis better than anybody else at something.
p48
aVThat disproves that popular notion
p49
aVthat if you're the smartest person in the room,
p50
aVyou're in the wrong room.
p51
aV(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VSo let me tell you about
p54
aVa Hollywood party I went to a couple years back,
p55
aVand I met this up-and-coming actress,
p56
aVand we were soon talking about something
p57
aVthat we both felt passionately about: public art.
p58
aVAnd she had the fervent belief
p59
aVthat every new building in Los Angeles
p60
aVshould have public art in it.
p61
aVShe wanted a regulation for it,
p62
aVand she fervently started \u2014
p63
aVwho is here from Chicago? \u2014
p64
aVshe fervently started talking about
p65
aVthese bean-shaped reflective sculptures
p66
aVin Millennium Park,
p67
aVand people would walk up to it
p68
aVand they'd smile in the reflection of it,
p69
aVand they'd pose and they'd vamp
p70
aVand they'd take selfies together,
p71
aVand they'd laugh.
p72
aVAnd as she was talking, a  thought came to my mind.
p73
aVI said, "I know someone you ought to meet.
p74
aVHe's getting out of San Quentin  in a couple of weeks" \u2014
p75
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p76
aV"and he shares your fervent desire
p77
aVthat art should engage and enable people to connect."
p78
aVHe spent five years in solitary,
p79
aVand I met him because I gave a speech at San Quentin,
p80
aVand he's articulate
p81
aVand he's rather easy on  the eyes because he's buff.
p82
aVHe had workout regime he did every day.
p83
aV(Laughter)
p84
aVI think she was following me at that point.
p85
aVI said, "He'd be an unexpected ally."
p86
aVAnd not just that. There's James. He's an architect
p87
aVand he's a professor, and he loves place-making,
p88
aVand place-making is when you have
p89
aVthose mini-plazas and those urban walkways
p90
aVand where they're dotted with art,
p91
aVwhere people draw and  come up and talk sometimes.
p92
aVI think they'd make good allies.
p93
aVAnd indeed they were.
p94
aVThey met together. They prepared.
p95
aVThey spoke in front of the  Los Angeles City Council.
p96
aVAnd the council members not only passed the regulation,
p97
aVhalf of them came down and asked to pose with them afterwards.
p98
aVThey were startling,  compelling and credible.
p99
aVYou can't buy that.
p100
aa(lp101
VWhat I'm asking you to consider
p102
aVis what kind of opportunity- makers we might become,
p103
aVbecause more than wealth
p104
aVor fancy titles
p105
aVor a lot of contacts, it's our capacity to connect
p106
aVaround each other's  better side and bring it out.
p107
aVAnd I'm not saying this is easy,
p108
aVand I'm sure many of you have made the wrong moves too
p109
aVabout who you wanted to connect with,
p110
aVbut what I want to suggest is,
p111
aVthis is an opportunity.
p112
aVI started thinking about it
p113
aVway back when I was a  Wall Street Journal reporter
p114
aVand I was in Europe and I was supposed to cover trends
p115
aVand trends that transcended business
p116
aVor politics or lifestyle.
p117
aVSo I had to have contacts
p118
aVin different worlds very different than mine,
p119
aVbecause otherwise you couldn't spot the trends.
p120
aVAnd third, I had to write the story
p121
aVin a way stepping into the reader's shoes,
p122
aVso they could see how these  trends could affect their lives.
p123
aVThat's what opportunity-makers do.
p124
aa(lp125
VAnd here's a strange thing:
p126
aVUnlike an increasing number of Americans
p127
aVwho are working and living  and playing with people
p128
aVwho think exactly like them
p129
aVbecause we then become more rigid and extreme,
p130
aVopportunity-makers are actively seeking situations
p131
aVwith people unlike them,
p132
aVand they're building relationships,
p133
aVand because they do that,
p134
aVthey have trusted relationships
p135
aVwhere they can bring the right team in
p136
aVand recruit them to solve a  problem better and faster
p137
aVand seize more opportunities.
p138
aVThey're not affronted by differences,
p139
aVthey're fascinated by them,
p140
aVand that is a huge shift in mindset,
p141
aVand once you feel it, you  want it to happen a lot more.
p142
aVThis world is calling out for us  to have a collective mindset,
p143
aVand I believe in doing that.
p144
aVIt's especially important now.
p145
aVWhy is it important now?
p146
aVBecause things can be devised like drones
p147
aVand drugs and data collection,
p148
aVand they can be devised by more people
p149
aVand cheaper ways for beneficial purposes
p150
aVand then, as we know from the news every day,
p151
aVthey can be used for dangerous ones.
p152
aVIt calls on us, each of us,
p153
aVto a higher calling.
p154
aa(lp155
VBut here's the icing on the cake:
p156
aVIt's not just the first opportunity
p157
aVthat you do with somebody else
p158
aVthat's probably your greatest,
p159
aVas an institution or an individual.
p160
aVIt's after you've had that experience
p161
aVand you trust each other.
p162
aVIt's the unexpected things
p163
aVthat you devise later on
p164
aVyou never could have predicted.
p165
aVFor example, Marty is the husband  of that actress I mentioned,
p166
aVand he watched them  when they were practicing,
p167
aVand he was soon talking to Wally,
p168
aVmy friend the ex-con,
p169
aVabout that exercise regime.
p170
aVAnd he thought,
p171
aVI have a set of racquetball courts.
p172
aVThat guy could teach it.
p173
aVA lot of people who work there are members at my courts.
p174
aVThey're frequent travelers.
p175
aVThey could practice in their hotel room,
p176
aVno equipment provided.
p177
aVThat's how Wally got hired.
p178
aVNot only that, years later
p179
aVhe was also teaching racquetball.
p180
aVYears after that,
p181
aVhe was teaching the racquetball teachers.
p182
aVWhat I'm suggesting is, when  you connect with people
p183
aVaround a shared interest and action,
p184
aVyou're accustomed to serendipitous
p185
aVthings happening into the future,
p186
aVand I think that's what we're looking at.
p187
aVWe open ourselves up to those opportunities,
p188
aVand in this room  are key players in technology,
p189
aVkey players who are uniquely positioned to do this,
p190
aVto scale systems and projects together.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo here's what I'm calling for you to do.
p193
aVRemember the three traits of opportunity-makers.
p194
aVOpportunity-makers keep honing their top strength
p195
aVand they become pattern seekers.
p196
aVThey get involved in different  worlds than their worlds
p197
aVso they're trusted and they  can see those patterns,
p198
aVand they communicate to connect
p199
aVaround sweet spots of shared interest.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo what I'm asking you is,
p202
aVthe world is hungry.
p203
aVI truly believe, in my firsthand experience,
p204
aVthe world is hungry for us
p205
aVto unite together as opportunity-makers
p206
aVand to emulate those behaviors
p207
aVas so many of you already do \u2014
p208
aVI know that firsthand \u2014
p209
aVand to reimagine a world
p210
aVwhere we use our best talents together
p211
aVmore often to accomplish greater things together
p212
aVthan we could on our own.
p213
aVJust remember,
p214
aVas Dave Liniger once said,
p215
aV"You can't succeed
p216
aVcoming to the potluck with only a fork."
p217
aV(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VThank you very much.
p220
aVThank you. (Applause)

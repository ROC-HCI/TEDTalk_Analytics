VSo, this is a story
p5
aVabout how we know what we know.
p6
aa(lp7
VIt's a story about this woman,
p8
aVNatalia Rybczynski.
p9
aVShe's a paleobiologist,
p10
aVwhich means she specializes in digging up really old dead stuff.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Audio) Natalia Rybczynski: Yeah, I had someone call me "Dr. Dead Things."
p13
aa(lp14
VLatif Nasser: And I think she's particularly interesting
p15
aVbecause of where she digs that stuff up,
p16
aVway above the Arctic Circle in the remote Canadian tundra.
p17
aa(lp18
VNow, one summer day in 2006,
p19
aVshe was at a dig site called the Fyles Leaf Bed,
p20
aVwhich is less than 10 degrees latitude away from the magnetic north pole.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Audio) NR: Really, it's not going to sound very exciting,
p23
aVbecause it was a day of walking with your backpack and your GPS
p24
aVand notebook and just picking up anything that might be a fossil.
p25
aa(lp26
VLN: And at some point, she noticed something.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Audio) NR: Rusty, kind of rust-colored,
p29
aVabout the size of the palm of my hand.
p30
aVIt was just lying on the surface.
p31
aa(lp32
VLN: And at first she thought it was just a splinter of wood,
p33
aVbecause that's the sort of thing people had found
p34
aVat the Fyles Leaf Bed before \u2014 prehistoric plant parts.
p35
aVBut that night, back at camp ...
p36
aa(lp37
V(Audio) NR: ... I get out the hand lens,
p38
aVI'm looking a little bit more closely and realizing
p39
aVit doesn't quite look like this has tree rings.
p40
aVMaybe it's a preservation thing,
p41
aVbut it looks really like ...
p42
aVbone.
p43
aa(lp44
VLN: Huh. So over the next four years,
p45
aVshe went to that spot over and over,
p46
aVand eventually collected 30 fragments of that exact same bone,
p47
aVmost of them really tiny.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Audio) NR: It's not a whole lot. It fits in a small Ziploc bag.
p50
aa(lp51
VLN: And she tried to piece them together like a jigsaw puzzle.
p52
aVBut it was challenging.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Audio) NR: It's broken up into so many little tiny pieces,
p55
aVI'm trying to use sand and putty, and it's not looking good.
p56
aVSo finally, we used a 3D surface scanner.
p57
aa(lp58
VLN: Ooh! NR: Yeah, right?
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VLN: It turns out it was way easier to do it virtually.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Audio) NR: It's kind of magical when it all fits together.
p65
aa(lp66
VLN: How certain were you that you had it right,
p67
aVthat you had put it together in the right way?
p68
aVWas there a potential that you'd put it together a different way
p69
aVand have, like, a parakeet or something?
p70
aa(lp71
V(Laughter)
p72
aa(lp73
V(Audio) NR: (Laughs) Um, no. No, we got this.
p74
aa(lp75
VLN: What she had, she discovered, was a tibia, a leg bone,
p76
aVand specifically, one that belonged to a cloven-hoofed mammal,
p77
aVso something like a cow or a sheep.
p78
aVBut it couldn't have been either of those.
p79
aVIt was just too big.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Audio) NR: The size of this thing, it was huge. It's a really big animal.
p82
aa(lp83
VLN: So what animal could it be?
p84
aVHaving hit a wall, she showed one of the fragments
p85
aVto some colleagues of hers in Colorado,
p86
aVand they had an idea.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Audio) NR: We took a saw, and we nicked just the edge of it,
p89
aVand there was this really interesting smell that comes from it.
p90
aa(lp91
VLN: It smelled kind of like singed flesh.
p92
aVIt was a smell that Natalia recognized
p93
aVfrom cutting up skulls in her gross anatomy lab:
p94
aVcollagen.
p95
aVCollagen is what gives structure to our bones.
p96
aVAnd usually, after so many years,
p97
aVit breaks down.
p98
aVBut in this case, the Arctic had acted like a natural freezer and preserved it.
p99
aa(lp100
VThen a year or two later, Natalia was at a conference in Bristol,
p101
aVand she saw that a colleague of hers named Mike Buckley
p102
aVwas demoing this new process that he called "collagen fingerprinting."
p103
aVIt turns out that different species have slightly different structures
p104
aVof collagen,
p105
aVso if you get a collagen profile of an unknown bone,
p106
aVyou can compare it to those of known species,
p107
aVand, who knows, maybe you get a match.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo she shipped him one of the fragments,
p110
aVFedEx.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Audio) NR: Yeah, you want to track it. It's kind of important.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VLN: And he processed it,
p117
aVand compared it to 37 known and modern-day mammal species.
p118
aVAnd he found a match.
p119
aVIt turns out that the 3.5 million-year-old bone
p120
aVthat Natalia had dug out of the High Arctic
p121
aVbelonged to ...
p122
aVa camel.
p123
aa(lp124
V(Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
V(Audio) NR: And I'm thinking, what? That's amazing \u2014 if it's true.
p127
aa(lp128
VLN: So they tested a bunch of the fragments,
p129
aVand they got the same result for each one.
p130
aVHowever, based on the size of the bone that they found,
p131
aVit meant that this camel was 30 percent larger than modern-day camels.
p132
aVSo this camel would have been about nine feet tall,
p133
aVweighed around a ton.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Audience reacts)
p136
aa(lp137
VYeah.
p138
aVNatalia had found a Giant Arctic camel.
p139
aa(lp140
V(Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
VNow, when you hear the word "camel,"
p143
aVwhat may come to mind is one of these,
p144
aVthe Bactrian camel of East and Central Asia.
p145
aVBut chances are the postcard image you have in your brain
p146
aVis one of these, the dromedary,
p147
aVquintessential desert creature \u2014
p148
aVhangs out in sandy, hot places like the Middle East and the Sahara,
p149
aVhas a big old hump on its back
p150
aVfor storing water for those long desert treks,
p151
aVhas big, broad feet to help it tromp over sand dunes.
p152
aVSo how on earth would one of these guys end up in the High Arctic?
p153
aa(lp154
VWell, scientists have known for a long time, turns out,
p155
aVeven before Natalia's discovery,
p156
aVthat camels are actually originally American.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Music: The Star-Spangled Banner)
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VThey started here.
p163
aVFor nearly 40 of the 45 million years that camels have been around,
p164
aVyou could only find them in North America,
p165
aVaround 20 different species, maybe more.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Audio) LN: If I put them all in a lineup, would they look different?
p168
aa(lp169
VNR: Yeah, you're going to have different body sizes.
p170
aVYou'll have some with really long necks,
p171
aVso they're actually functionally like giraffes.
p172
aa(lp173
VLN: Some had snouts, like crocodiles.
p174
aa(lp175
V(Audio) NR: The really primitive, early ones would have been really small,
p176
aValmost like rabbits.
p177
aa(lp178
VLN: What? Rabbit-sized camels?
p179
aa(lp180
V(Audio) NR: The earliest ones.
p181
aVSo those ones you probably would not recognize.
p182
aa(lp183
VLN: Oh my God, I want a pet rabbit-camel.
p184
aa(lp185
V(Audio) NR: I know, wouldn't that be great?
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VLN: And then about three to seven million years ago,
p190
aVone branch of camels went down to South America,
p191
aVwhere they became llamas and alpacas,
p192
aVand another branch crossed over the Bering Land Bridge
p193
aVinto Asia and Africa.
p194
aVAnd then around the end of the last ice age,
p195
aVNorth American camels went extinct.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo, scientists knew all of that already,
p198
aVbut it still doesn't fully explain how Natalia found one so far north.
p199
aVLike, this is, temperature-wise, the polar opposite of the Sahara.
p200
aVNow to be fair,
p201
aVthree and a half million years ago,
p202
aVit was on average 22 degrees Celsius warmer than it is now.
p203
aVSo it would have been boreal forest,
p204
aVso more like the Yukon or Siberia today.
p205
aVBut still, like, they would have six-month-long winters
p206
aVwhere the ponds would freeze over.
p207
aVYou'd have blizzards.
p208
aVYou'd have 24 hours a day of straight darkness.
p209
aVLike, how ... How?
p210
aVHow is it that one of these Saharan superstars
p211
aVcould ever have survived those arctic conditions?
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
VNatalia and her colleagues think they have an answer.
p216
aVAnd it's kind of brilliant.
p217
aVWhat if the very features that we imagine make the camel so well-suited
p218
aVto places like the Sahara,
p219
aVactually evolved to help it get through the winter?
p220
aVWhat if those broad feet were meant to tromp not over sand,
p221
aVbut over snow, like a pair of snowshoes?
p222
aVWhat if that hump \u2014 which, huge news to me,
p223
aVdoes not contain water, it contains fat \u2014
p224
aa(lp225
V(Laughter)
p226
aa(lp227
Vwas there to help the camel get through that six-month-long winter,
p228
aVwhen food was scarce?
p229
aVAnd then, only later, long after it crossed over the land bridge
p230
aVdid it retrofit those winter features for a hot desert environment?
p231
aVLike, for instance, the hump may be helpful to camels in hotter climes
p232
aVbecause having all your fat in one place,
p233
aVlike a, you know, fat backpack,
p234
aVmeans that you don't have to have that insulation
p235
aVall over the rest of your body.
p236
aVSo it helps heat dissipate easier.
p237
aVIt's this crazy idea,
p238
aVthat what seems like proof of the camel's quintessential desert nature
p239
aVcould actually be proof of its High Arctic past.
p240
aa(lp241
VNow, I'm not the first person to tell this story.
p242
aVOthers have told it as a way to marvel at evolutionary biology
p243
aVor as a keyhole into the future of climate change.
p244
aVBut I love it for a totally different reason.
p245
aVFor me, it's a story about us,
p246
aVabout how we see the world
p247
aVand about how that changes.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo I was trained as a historian.
p250
aVAnd I've learned that, actually, a lot of scientists are historians, too.
p251
aVThey make sense of the past.
p252
aVThey tell the history of our universe, of our planet, of life on this planet.
p253
aVAnd as a historian,
p254
aVyou start with an idea in your mind of how the story goes.
p255
aa(lp256
V(Audio) NR: We make up stories and we stick with it,
p257
aVlike the camel in the desert, right?
p258
aVThat's a great story! It's totally adapted for that.
p259
aVClearly, it always lived there.
p260
aa(lp261
VLN: But at any moment, you could uncover some tiny bit of evidence.
p262
aVYou could learn some tiny thing
p263
aVthat forces you to reframe everything you thought you knew.
p264
aVLike, in this case, this one scientist finds this one shard
p265
aVof what she thought was wood,
p266
aVand because of that, science has a totally new and totally counterintuitive theory
p267
aVabout why this absurd Dr. Seuss-looking creature
p268
aVlooks the way it does.
p269
aVAnd for me, it completely upended the way I think of the camel.
p270
aVIt went from being this ridiculously niche creature
p271
aVsuited only to this one specific environment,
p272
aVto being this world traveler that just happens to be in the Sahara,
p273
aVand could end up virtually anywhere.
p274
aa(lp275
V(Applause)
p276
aa(lp277
VThis is Azuri.
p278
aVAzuri, hi, how are you doing?
p279
aVOK, here, I've got one of these for you here.
p280
aa(lp281
V(Laughter)
p282
aa(lp283
VSo Azuri is on a break from her regular gig
p284
aVat the Radio City Music Hall.
p285
aa(lp286
V(Laughter)
p287
aa(lp288
VThat's not even a joke.
p289
aVAnyway \u2014
p290
aa(lp291
VBut really, Azuri is here as a living reminder
p292
aVthat the story of our world is a dynamic one.
p293
aVIt requires our willingness to readjust, to reimagine.
p294
aa(lp295
V(Laughter)
p296
aa(lp297
VRight, Azuri?
p298
aa(lp299
VAnd, really, that we're all just one shard of bone away
p300
aVfrom seeing the world anew.
p301
aa(lp302
VThank you very much.
p303
aa(lp304
V(Applause)

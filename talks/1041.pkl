VSo today, I'm going to tell you about some people
p5
aVwho didn't move out of their neighborhoods.
p6
aVThe first one is happening right here in Chicago.
p7
aVBrenda Palms-Farber was hired
p8
aVto help ex-convicts reenter society
p9
aVand keep them from going back into prison.
p10
aVCurrently, taxpayers spend
p11
aVabout 60,000 dollars per year
p12
aVsending a person to jail.
p13
aVWe know that two-thirds of them are going to go back.
p14
aVI find it interesting that, for every one dollar
p15
aVwe spend, however, on early childhood education,
p16
aVlike Head Start,
p17
aVwe save 17 dollars
p18
aVon stuff like incarceration in the future.
p19
aVOr \u2014 think about it \u2014 that 60,000 dollars
p20
aVis more than what it costs
p21
aVto send one person to Harvard as well.
p22
aa(lp23
VBut Brenda, not being phased by stuff like that,
p24
aVtook a look at her challenge
p25
aVand came up
p26
aVwith a not-so-obvious solution:
p27
aVcreate a business
p28
aVthat produces skin care products from honey.
p29
aVOkay, it might be obvious to some of you; it wasn't to me.
p30
aVIt's the basis of growing a form of social innovation
p31
aVthat has real potential.
p32
aVShe hired seemingly unemployable men and women
p33
aVto care for the bees, harvest the honey
p34
aVand make value-added products
p35
aVthat they marketed themselves,
p36
aVand that were later sold at Whole Foods.
p37
aVShe combined employment experience and training
p38
aVwith life skills they needed,
p39
aVlike anger-management and teamwork,
p40
aVand also how to talk to future employers
p41
aVabout how their experiences
p42
aVactually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned
p43
aVand their eagerness to learn more.
p44
aVLess than four percent
p45
aVof the folks that went through her program
p46
aVactually go back to jail.
p47
aVSo these young men and women learned job-readiness
p48
aVand life skills through bee keeping
p49
aVand became productive citizens in the process.
p50
aVTalk about a sweet beginning.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, I'm going to take you to Los Angeles,
p53
aVand lots of people know
p54
aVthat L.A. has its issues.
p55
aVBut I'm going to talk about L.A.'s water issues right now.
p56
aVThey have not enough water on most days
p57
aVand too much to handle when it rains.
p58
aVCurrently, 20 percent
p59
aVof California's energy consumption
p60
aVis used to pump water
p61
aVinto mostly Southern California.
p62
aVTheir spending loads, loads,
p63
aVto channel that rainwater out into the ocean
p64
aVwhen it rains and floods as well.
p65
aVNow Andy Lipkis is working to help
p66
aVL.A. cut infrastructure costs
p67
aVassociated with water management and urban heat island \u2014
p68
aVlinking trees, people and technology
p69
aVto create a more livable city.
p70
aVAll that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water,
p71
aValso helps cool our cities.
p72
aVBecause, come to think about it,
p73
aVdo you really want air-conditioning,
p74
aVor is it a cooler room that you want?
p75
aVHow you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo a few years ago,
p78
aVL.A. County
p79
aVdecided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollars
p80
aVto repair the city schools.
p81
aVAnd Andy and his team discovered
p82
aVthat they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars
p83
aVon asphalt to surround the schools themselves.
p84
aVAnd by presenting a really strong economic case,
p85
aVthey convinced the L.A. government
p86
aVthat replacing that asphalt
p87
aVwith trees and other greenery,
p88
aVthat the schools themselves would save the system more on energy
p89
aVthan they spend on horticultural infrastructure.
p90
aVSo ultimately, 20 million square feet of asphalt
p91
aVwas replaced or avoided,
p92
aVand electrical consumption for air-conditioning went down,
p93
aVwhile employment
p94
aVfor people to maintain those grounds went up,
p95
aVresulting in a net-savings to the system,
p96
aVbut also healthier students and schools system employees as well.
p97
aa(lp98
VNow Judy Bonds
p99
aVis a coal miner's daughter.
p100
aVHer family has eight generations
p101
aVin a town called Whitesville, West Virginia.
p102
aVAnd if anyone should be clinging
p103
aVto the former glory of the coal mining history,
p104
aVand of the town,
p105
aVit should be Judy.
p106
aVBut the way coal is mined right now is different
p107
aVfrom the deep mines that her father
p108
aVand her father's father would go down into
p109
aVand that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people.
p110
aVNow, two dozen men
p111
aVcan tear down a mountain in several months,
p112
aVand only for about a few years' worth of coal.
p113
aVThat kind of technology is called "mountaintop removal."
p114
aVIt can make a mountain go from this to this
p115
aVin a few short months.
p116
aVJust imagine that the air surrounding these places \u2014
p117
aVit's filled with the residue of explosives and coal.
p118
aVWhen we visited, it gave some of the people we were with
p119
aVthis strange little cough
p120
aVafter being only there for just a few hours or so \u2014
p121
aVnot just miners, but everybody.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd Judy saw her landscape being destroyed
p124
aVand her water poisoned.
p125
aVAnd the coal companies just move on
p126
aVafter the mountain was emptied,
p127
aVleaving even more unemployment in their wake.
p128
aVBut she also saw the difference in potential wind energy
p129
aVon an intact mountain,
p130
aVand one that was reduced in elevation
p131
aVby over 2,000 feet.
p132
aVThree years of dirty energy with not many jobs,
p133
aVor centuries of clean energy
p134
aVwith the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency
p135
aVbased on technical skills,
p136
aVand developing local knowledge
p137
aVabout how to get the most out of that region's wind.
p138
aVShe calculated the up-front cost
p139
aVand the payback over time,
p140
aVand it's a net-plus on so many levels
p141
aVfor the local, national and global economy.
p142
aVIt's a longer payback than mountaintop removal,
p143
aVbut the wind energy actually pays back forever.
p144
aVNow mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals,
p145
aVand it gives them a lot of misery.
p146
aVThe water is turned into goo.
p147
aVMost people are still unemployed,
p148
aVleading to most of the same kinds of social problems
p149
aVthat unemployed people in inner cities also experience \u2014
p150
aVdrug and alcohol abuse,
p151
aVdomestic abuse, teen pregnancy and poor heath, as well.
p152
aa(lp153
VNow Judy and I \u2014 I have to say \u2014
p154
aVtotally related to each other.
p155
aVNot quite an obvious alliance.
p156
aVI mean, literally, her hometown is called Whitesville, West Virginia.
p157
aVI mean, they are not \u2014
p158
aVthey ain't competing for the birthplace of hip hop title
p159
aVor anything like that.
p160
aVBut the back of my T-shirt, the one that she gave me,
p161
aVsays, "Save the endangered hillbillies."
p162
aVSo homegirls and hillbillies we got it together
p163
aVand totally understand that this is what it's all about.
p164
aVBut just a few months ago,
p165
aVJudy was diagnosed
p166
aVwith stage-three lung cancer.
p167
aVYeah.
p168
aVAnd it has since moved to her bones and her brain.
p169
aVAnd I just find it so bizarre
p170
aVthat she's suffering from the same thing
p171
aVthat she tried so hard to protect people from.
p172
aVBut her dream
p173
aVof Coal River Mountain Wind
p174
aVis her legacy.
p175
aVAnd she might not
p176
aVget to see that mountaintop.
p177
aVBut rather than writing
p178
aVyet some kind of manifesto or something,
p179
aVshe's leaving behind
p180
aVa business plan to make it happen.
p181
aVThat's what my homegirl is doing.
p182
aVSo I'm so proud of that.
p183
aa(lp184
V(Applause)
p185
aa(lp186
VBut these three people
p187
aVdon't know each other,
p188
aVbut they do have an awful lot in common.
p189
aVThey're all problem solvers,
p190
aVand they're just some of the many examples
p191
aVthat I really am privileged to see, meet and learn from
p192
aVin the examples of the work that I do now.
p193
aVI was really lucky to have them all featured
p194
aVon my Corporation for Public Radio radio show
p195
aVcalled ThePromisedLand.org.
p196
aVNow they're all very practical visionaries.
p197
aVThey take a look at the demands that are out there \u2014
p198
aVbeauty products, healthy schools, electricity \u2014
p199
aVand how the money's flowing to meet those demands.
p200
aVAnd when the cheapest solutions
p201
aVinvolve reducing the number of jobs,
p202
aVyou're left with unemployed people,
p203
aVand those people aren't cheap.
p204
aVIn fact, they make up some of what I call the most expensive citizens,
p205
aVand they include generationally impoverished,
p206
aVtraumatized vets returning from the Middle East,
p207
aVpeople coming out of jail.
p208
aVAnd for the veterans in particular,
p209
aVthe V.A. said there's a six-fold increase
p210
aVin mental health pharmaceuticals by vets since 2003.
p211
aVI think that number's probably going to go up.
p212
aVThey're not the largest number of people,
p213
aVbut they are some of the most expensive \u2014
p214
aVand in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse, drug and alcohol abuse,
p215
aVpoor performance by their kids in schools
p216
aVand also poor health as a result of stress.
p217
aVSo these three guys all understand
p218
aVhow to productively channel dollars
p219
aVthrough our local economies
p220
aVto meet existing market demands,
p221
aVreduce the social problems that we have now
p222
aVand prevent new problems in the future.
p223
aa(lp224
VAnd there are plenty of other examples like that.
p225
aVOne problem: waste handling and unemployment.
p226
aVEven when we think or talk about recycling,
p227
aVlots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills
p228
aVand leaving many municipalities, diversion rates \u2014
p229
aVthey leave much to be recycled.
p230
aVAnd where is this waste handled? Usually in poor communities.
p231
aVAnd we know that eco-industrial business, these kinds of business models \u2014
p232
aVthere's a model in Europe called the eco-industrial park,
p233
aVwhere either the waste of one company is the raw material for another,
p234
aVor you use recycled materials
p235
aVto make goods that you can actually use and sell.
p236
aVWe can create these local markets and incentives
p237
aVfor recycled materials
p238
aVto be used as raw materials for manufacturing.
p239
aVAnd in my hometown, we actually tried to do one of these in the Bronx,
p240
aVbut our mayor decided what he wanted to see
p241
aVwas a jail on that same spot.
p242
aVFortunately \u2014 because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs \u2014
p243
aVbut after many years,
p244
aVthe city wanted to build a jail.
p245
aVThey've since abandoned that project, thank goodness.
p246
aa(lp247
VAnother problem: unhealthy food systems and unemployment.
p248
aVWorking-class and poor urban Americans
p249
aVare not benefiting economically
p250
aVfrom our current food system.
p251
aVIt relies too much on transportation,
p252
aVchemical fertilization, big use of water
p253
aVand also refrigeration.
p254
aVMega agricultural operations
p255
aVoften are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land,
p256
aVand it produces this incredibly unhealthy product
p257
aVthat costs us billions in healthcare
p258
aVand lost productivity.
p259
aVAnd so we know "urban ag"
p260
aVis a big buzz topic this time of the year,
p261
aVbut it's mostly gardening,
p262
aVwhich has some value in community building \u2014 lots of it \u2014
p263
aVbut it's not in terms of creating jobs
p264
aVor for food production.
p265
aVThe numbers just aren't there.
p266
aVPart of my work now is really laying the groundwork
p267
aVto integrate urban ag and rural food systems
p268
aVto hasten the demise of the 3,000-mile salad
p269
aVby creating a national brand of urban-grown produce
p270
aVin every city,
p271
aVthat uses regional growing power
p272
aVand augments it with indoor growing facilities,
p273
aVowned and operated by small growers,
p274
aVwhere now there are only consumers.
p275
aVThis can support seasonal farmers around metro areas
p276
aVwho are losing out because they really can't meet
p277
aVthe year-round demand for produce.
p278
aVIt's not a competition with rural farm;
p279
aVit's actually reinforcements.
p280
aVIt allies in a really positive
p281
aVand economically viable food system.
p282
aa(lp283
VThe goal is to meet the cities' institutional demands
p284
aVfor hospitals,
p285
aVsenior centers, schools, daycare centers,
p286
aVand produce a network of regional jobs, as well.
p287
aVThis is smart infrastructure.
p288
aVAnd how we manage our built environment
p289
aVaffects the health and well-being of people every single day.
p290
aVOur municipalities, rural and urban,
p291
aVplay the operational course of infrastructure \u2014
p292
aVthings like waste disposal, energy demand,
p293
aVas well as social costs of unemployment, drop-out rates, incarceration rates
p294
aVand the impacts of various public health costs.
p295
aVSmart infrastructure can provide cost-saving ways
p296
aVfor municipalities to handle
p297
aVboth infrastructure and social needs.
p298
aVAnd we want to shift the systems
p299
aVthat open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdens
p300
aVto become part of the tax base.
p301
aVAnd imagine a national business model
p302
aVthat creates local jobs and smart infrastructure
p303
aVto improve local economic stability.
p304
aVSo I'm hoping you can see a little theme here.
p305
aa(lp306
VThese examples indicate a trend.
p307
aVI haven't created it, and it's not happening by accident.
p308
aVI'm noticing that it's happening all over the country,
p309
aVand the good news is that it's growing.
p310
aVAnd we all need to be invested in it.
p311
aVIt is an essential pillar to this country's recovery.
p312
aVAnd I call it "hometown security."
p313
aVThe recession has us reeling and fearful,
p314
aVand there's something in the air these days
p315
aVthat is also very empowering.
p316
aVIt's a realization
p317
aVthat we are the key
p318
aVto our own recovery.
p319
aVNow is the time for us to act in our own communities
p320
aVwhere we think local and we act local.
p321
aVAnd when we do that, our neighbors \u2014
p322
aVbe they next-door, or in the next state,
p323
aVor in the next country \u2014
p324
aVwill be just fine.
p325
aVThe sum of the local is the global.
p326
aVHometown security means rebuilding our natural defenses,
p327
aVputting people to work,
p328
aVrestoring our natural systems.
p329
aVHometown security means creating wealth here at home,
p330
aVinstead of destroying it overseas.
p331
aVTackling social and environmental problems
p332
aVat the same time with the same solution
p333
aVyields great cost savings,
p334
aVwealth generation and national security.
p335
aVMany great and inspiring solutions
p336
aVhave been generated across America.
p337
aVThe challenge for us now
p338
aVis to identify and support countless more.
p339
aa(lp340
VNow, hometown security is about taking care of your own,
p341
aVbut it's not like the old saying,
p342
aV"charity begins at home."
p343
aVI recently read a book called "Love Leadership" by John Hope Bryant.
p344
aVAnd it's about leading in a world
p345
aVthat really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear.
p346
aVAnd reading that book made me reexamine that theory
p347
aVbecause I need to explain what I mean by that.
p348
aVSee, my dad
p349
aVwas a great, great man in many ways.
p350
aVHe grew up in the segregated South,
p351
aVescaped lynching and all that
p352
aVduring some really hard times,
p353
aVand he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings
p354
aVand a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times.
p355
aVBut, like all of us, he had some problems.
p356
aV(Laughter)
p357
aVAnd his was gambling,
p358
aVcompulsively.
p359
aVTo him that phrase, "Charity begins at home,"
p360
aVmeant that my payday \u2014 or someone else's \u2014
p361
aVwould just happen to coincide with his lucky day.
p362
aVSo you need to help him out.
p363
aVAnd sometimes I would loan him money
p364
aVfrom my after-school or summer jobs,
p365
aVand he always had the great intention
p366
aVof paying me back with interest,
p367
aVof course, after he hit it big.
p368
aVAnd he did sometimes, believe it or not,
p369
aVat a racetrack in Los Angeles \u2014
p370
aVone reason to love L.A. \u2014 back in the 1940s.
p371
aVHe made 15,000 dollars cash
p372
aVand bought the house that I grew up in.
p373
aVSo I'm not that unhappy about that.
p374
aVBut listen, I did feel obligated to him,
p375
aVand I grew up \u2014 then I grew up.
p376
aVAnd I'm a grown woman now,
p377
aVand I have learned a few things along the way.
p378
aa(lp379
VTo me, charity
p380
aVoften is just about giving,
p381
aVbecause you're supposed to,
p382
aVor because it's what you've always done,
p383
aVor it's about giving until it hurts.
p384
aVI'm about providing the means
p385
aVto build something that will grow
p386
aVand intensify its original investment
p387
aVand not just require greater giving next year \u2014
p388
aVI'm not trying to feed the habit.
p389
aVI spent some years
p390
aVwatching how good intentions for community empowerment,
p391
aVthat were supposed to be there
p392
aVto support the community and empower it,
p393
aVactually left people
p394
aVin the same, if not worse, position that they were in before.
p395
aVAnd over the past 20 years,
p396
aVwe've spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars
p397
aVon social problems,
p398
aVyet educational outcomes,
p399
aVmalnutrition, incarceration,
p400
aVobesity, diabetes, income disparity,
p401
aVthey've all gone up with some exceptions \u2014
p402
aVin particular, infant mortality
p403
aVamong people in poverty \u2014
p404
aVbut it's a great world that we're bringing them into as well.
p405
aa(lp406
VAnd I know a little bit about these issues,
p407
aVbecause, for many years, I spent a long time
p408
aVin the non-profit industrial complex,
p409
aVand I'm a recovering executive director,
p410
aVtwo years clean.
p411
aV(Laughter)
p412
aVBut during that time, I realized that it was about projects
p413
aVand developing them on the local level
p414
aVthat really was going to do the right thing for our communities.
p415
aVBut I really did struggle for financial support.
p416
aVThe greater our success,
p417
aVthe less money came in from foundations.
p418
aVAnd I tell you, being on the TED stage
p419
aVand winning a MacArthur in the same exact year
p420
aVgave everyone the impression that I had arrived.
p421
aVAnd by the time I'd moved on,
p422
aVI was actually covering a third
p423
aVof my agency's budget deficit with speaking fees.
p424
aVAnd I think because early on, frankly,
p425
aVmy programs were just a little bit ahead of their time.
p426
aVBut since then,
p427
aVthe park that was just a dump and was featured at a TED2006 Talk
p428
aVbecame this little thing.
p429
aVBut I did in fact get married in it.
p430
aVOver here.
p431
aVThere goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding.
p432
aVThe South Bronx Greenway
p433
aVwas also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006.
p434
aVSince then, we got
p435
aVabout 50 million dollars in stimulus package money
p436
aVto come and get here.
p437
aVAnd we love this, because I love construction now,
p438
aVbecause we're watching these things actually happen.
p439
aa(lp440
VSo I want everyone to understand
p441
aVthe critical importance
p442
aVof shifting charity into enterprise.
p443
aVI started my firm to help communities across the country
p444
aVrealize their own potential
p445
aVto improve everything about the quality of life for their people.
p446
aVHometown security
p447
aVis next on my to-do list.
p448
aVWhat we need are people who see the value
p449
aVin investing in these types of local enterprises,
p450
aVwho will partner with folks like me
p451
aVto identify the growth trends and climate adaptation
p452
aVas well as understand the growing social costs
p453
aVof business as usual.
p454
aVWe need to work together
p455
aVto embrace and repair our land,
p456
aVrepair our power systems
p457
aVand repair ourselves.
p458
aVIt's time to stop building
p459
aVthe shopping malls, the prisons,
p460
aVthe stadiums
p461
aVand other tributes to all of our collective failures.
p462
aVIt is time that we start building
p463
aVliving monuments to hope and possibility.

Then <strong>she scored $1.25 million in federal funds for a greenway along the South Bronx waterfront</strong>, bringing the neighborhood open space, pedestrian and bike paths, and space for mixed-use economic development.</p><p>Her success is no surprise to anyone who&#39;s seen her speak; <strong>Carter&#39;s confidence, energy and intensely emotional delivery make her talks themselves a force of nature.</strong> (The release of her TEDTalk in 2006 prompted Guy Kawasaki to wonder on his <a href=\\"http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/07/as_good_as_stev.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">blog</a>  whether she wasn&#39;t &quot;every bit as good as [Apple CEO] Steve Jobs,&quot; a legendary presenter.)</p><p>Carter, who was awarded a 2005 MacArthur &quot;genius&quot; grant, served as executive director of <a href=\\"http://www.ssbx.org/staff.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Sustainable South Bronx</a> for 7 years, where she pushed both for eco-friendly practices (such as green and cool roofs) and, equally important, job training and green-related economic development for her vibrant neighborhood on the rise.

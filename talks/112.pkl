VI am a vicar in the Church of England.
p5
aVI've been a priest in the Church for 20 years.
p6
aVFor most of that time, I've been struggling and grappling
p7
aVwith questions about the nature of God. Who is God?
p8
aVAnd I'm very aware that when you say the word "God,"
p9
aVmany people will turn off immediately.
p10
aVAnd most people, both within and outside the organized church,
p11
aVstill have a picture of a celestial controller,
p12
aVa rule maker, a policeman in the sky who orders everything,
p13
aVand causes everything to happen.
p14
aVHe will protect his own people,
p15
aVand answer the prayers of the faithful.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd in the worship of my church,
p18
aVthe most frequently used adjective about God is "almighty."
p19
aVBut I have a problem with that.
p20
aVI have become more and more uncomfortable
p21
aVwith this perception of God over the years.
p22
aVDo we really believe that God is the kind of male boss that we've been presenting
p23
aVin our worship and in our liturgies over all these years?
p24
aa(lp25
VOf course, there have been thinkers
p26
aVwho have suggested different ways of looking at God.
p27
aVExploring the feminine, nurturing side of divinity.
p28
aVSuggesting that God expresses Himself or Herself through powerlessness,
p29
aVrather than power.
p30
aVAcknowledging that God is unknown and unknowable by definition.
p31
aVFinding deep resonances with other religions and philosophies
p32
aVand ways of looking at life as part of what is a universal and global search for meaning.
p33
aVThese ideas are well known in liberal academic circles,
p34
aVbut clergy like myself have been reluctant to air them,
p35
aVfor fear of creating tension and division in our church communities,
p36
aVfor fear of upsetting the simple faith of more traditional believers.
p37
aVI have chosen not to rock the boat.
p38
aa(lp39
VThen, on December 26th last year, just two months ago,
p40
aVthat underwater earthquake triggered the tsunami.
p41
aVAnd two weeks later, Sunday morning, 9th of January,
p42
aVI found myself standing in front of my congregation \u2014
p43
aVintelligent, well meaning, mostly thoughtful Christian people \u2014
p44
aVand I needed to express, on their behalf, our feelings and our questions.
p45
aVI had my own personal responses, but I also have a public role,
p46
aVand something needed to be said.
p47
aVAnd this is what I said.
p48
aa(lp49
VShortly after the tsunami I read a newspaper article
p50
aVwritten by the Archbishop of Canterbury \u2014 fine title \u2014
p51
aVabout the tragedy in Southern Asia.
p52
aVThe essence of what he said was this:
p53
aVthe people most affected by the devastation and loss of life
p54
aVdo not want intellectual theories about how God let this happen.
p55
aVHe wrote, "If some religious genius did come up with an explanation
p56
aVof exactly why all these deaths made sense,
p57
aVwould we feel happier, or safer, or more confident in God?"
p58
aa(lp59
VIf the man in the photograph that appeared in the newspapers,
p60
aVholding the hand of his dead child was standing in front of us now,
p61
aVthere are no words that we could say to him.
p62
aVA verbal response would not be appropriate.
p63
aVThe only appropriate response would be a compassionate silence
p64
aVand some kind of practical help.
p65
aVIt isn't a time for explanation, or preaching, or theology;
p66
aVit's a time for tears.
p67
aa(lp68
VThis is true. And yet here we are, my church in Oxford,
p69
aVsemi-detached from events that happened a long way away,
p70
aVbut with our faith bruised.
p71
aVAnd we want an explanation from God.
p72
aVWe demand an explanation from God.
p73
aVSome have concluded that we can only believe in a God who shares our pain.
p74
aVIn some way, God must feel the anguish, and grief,
p75
aVand physical pain that we feel.
p76
aVIn some way the eternal God must be able to enter into the souls of human beings
p77
aVand experience the torment within.
p78
aVAnd if this is true, it must also be that God knows the joy and exaltation
p79
aVof the human spirit, as well.
p80
aVWe want a God who can weep with those who weep,
p81
aVand rejoice with those who rejoice.
p82
aa(lp83
VThis seems to me both a deeply moving and a convincing re-statement
p84
aVof Christian belief about God.
p85
aVFor hundreds of years, the prevailing orthodoxy, the accepted truth,
p86
aVwas that God the Father, the Creator, is unchanging
p87
aVand therefore by definition cannot feel pain or sadness.
p88
aVNow the unchanging God feels a bit cold and indifferent to me.
p89
aVAnd the devastating events of the 20th century
p90
aVhave forced people to question the cold, unfeeling God.
p91
aVThe slaughter of millions in the trenches and in the death camps
p92
aVhave caused people to ask, "Where is God in all this?
p93
aVWho is God in all this?"
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd the answer was, "God is in this with us,
p96
aVor God doesn't deserve our allegiance anymore."
p97
aVIf God is a bystander, observing but not involved,
p98
aVthen God may well exist, but we don't want to know about Him.
p99
aVMany Jews and Christians now feel like this, I know.
p100
aVAnd I am among them.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo we have a suffering God \u2014
p103
aVa God who is intimately connected with this world and with every living soul.
p104
aVI very much relate to this idea of God.
p105
aVBut it isn't enough. I need to ask some more questions,
p106
aVand I hope they are questions that you will want to ask, as well,
p107
aVsome of you.
p108
aa(lp109
VOver the last few weeks I have been struck by the number of times
p110
aVthat words in our worship have felt a bit inappropriate, a bit dodgy.
p111
aVWe have a pram service on Tuesday mornings for mums and their pre-school children.
p112
aVAnd last week we sang with the children one of their favorite songs,
p113
aV"The Wise Man Built His House Upon the Rock."
p114
aVPerhaps some of you know it. Some of the words go like this:
p115
aV"The foolish man built his house upon the sand /
p116
aVAnd the floods came up / And the house on the sand went crash."
p117
aVThen in the same week, at a funeral,
p118
aVwe sang the familiar hymn "We Plow the Fields and Scatter,"
p119
aVa very English hymn.
p120
aVIn the second verse comes the line, "The wind and waves obey Him."
p121
aVDo they? I don't feel we can sing that song again in church,
p122
aVafter what's happened.
p123
aa(lp124
VSo the first big question is about control.
p125
aVDoes God have a plan for each of us? Is God in control?
p126
aVDoes God order each moment? Does the wind and the waves obey Him?
p127
aVFrom time to time,
p128
aVone hears Christians telling the story of how God organized things for them,
p129
aVso that everything worked out all right \u2014
p130
aVsome difficulty overcome, some illness cured, some trouble averted,
p131
aVa parking space found at a crucial time.
p132
aVI can remember someone saying this to me,
p133
aVwith her eyes shining with enthusiasm at this wonderful confirmation of her faith
p134
aVand the goodness of God.
p135
aa(lp136
VBut if God can or will do these things \u2014
p137
aVintervene to change the flow of events \u2014
p138
aVthen surely he could have stopped the tsunami.
p139
aVDo we have a local God who can do little things like parking spaces,
p140
aVbut not big things like 500 mile-per-hour waves?
p141
aVThat's just not acceptable to intelligent Christians,
p142
aVand we must acknowledge it.
p143
aVEither God is responsible for the tsunami,
p144
aVor God is not in control.
p145
aa(lp146
VAfter the tragedy, survival stories began to emerge.
p147
aVYou probably heard some of them:
p148
aVthe man who surfed the wave,
p149
aVthe teenage girl who recognized the danger
p150
aVbecause she had just been learning about tsunamis at school.
p151
aVThen there was the congregation who had left their usual church building on the shore
p152
aVto hold a service in the hills.
p153
aVThe preacher delivered an extra long sermon,
p154
aVso that they were still out of harm's way when the wave struck.
p155
aVAfterwards someone said that God must have been looking after them.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo the next question is about partiality.
p158
aVCan we earn God's favor by worshipping Him or believing in Him?
p159
aVDoes God demand loyalty, like any medieval tyrant?
p160
aVA God who looks after His own, so that Christians are OK,
p161
aVwhile everyone else perishes?
p162
aVA cosmic us and them, and a God who is guilty of the worst kind of favoritism?
p163
aVThat would be appalling,
p164
aVand that would be the point at which I would hand in my membership.
p165
aVSuch a God would be morally inferior to the highest ideals of humanity.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo who is God, if not the great puppet-master or the tribal protector?
p168
aVPerhaps God allows or permits terrible things to happen,
p169
aVso that heroism and compassion can be shown.
p170
aVPerhaps God is testing us: testing our charity, or our faith.
p171
aVPerhaps there is a great, cosmic plan that allows for horrible suffering
p172
aVso that everything will work out OK in the end.
p173
aVPerhaps, but these ideas are all just variations on God controlling everything,
p174
aVthe supreme commander toying with expendable units in a great campaign.
p175
aVWe are still left with a God who can do the tsunami and allow Auschwitz.
p176
aa(lp177
VIn his great novel, "The Brothers Karamazov," Dostoevsky gives these words to Ivan,
p178
aVaddressed to his naive and devout younger brother, Alyosha:
p179
aV"If the sufferings of children go to make up the sum of sufferings
p180
aVwhich is necessary for the purchase of truth,
p181
aVthen I say beforehand that the entire truth is not worth such a price.
p182
aVWe cannot afford to pay so much for admission.
p183
aVIt is not God that I do not accept.
p184
aVI merely, most respectfully, return Him the ticket."
p185
aa(lp186
VOr perhaps God set the whole universe going at the beginning
p187
aVand then relinquished control forever,
p188
aVso that natural processes could occur, and evolution run its course.
p189
aVThis seems more acceptable,
p190
aVbut it still leaves God with the ultimate moral responsibility.
p191
aVIs God a cold, unfeeling spectator?
p192
aVOr a powerless lover, watching with infinite compassion
p193
aVthings God is unable to control or change?
p194
aVIs God intimately involved in our suffering,
p195
aVso that He feels it in His own being?
p196
aa(lp197
VIf we believe something like this, we must let go of the puppet-master completely,
p198
aVtake our leave of the almighty controller, abandon traditional models.
p199
aVWe must think again about God.
p200
aVMaybe God doesn't do things at all.
p201
aVMaybe God isn't an agent like all of us are agents.
p202
aVEarly religious thought conceived God as a sort of superhuman person,
p203
aVdoing things all over the place.
p204
aVBeating up the Egyptians, drowning them in the Red Sea, wasting cities, getting angry.
p205
aVThe people knew their God by His mighty acts.
p206
aa(lp207
VBut what if God doesn't act? What if God doesn't do things at all?
p208
aVWhat if God is in things?
p209
aVThe loving soul of the universe.
p210
aVAn in-dwelling compassionate presence, underpinning and sustaining all things.
p211
aVWhat if God is in things?
p212
aVIn the infinitely complex network of relationships and connections that make up life.
p213
aVIn the natural cycle of life and death,
p214
aVthe creation and destruction that must happen continuously.
p215
aVIn the process of evolution.
p216
aVIn the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world.
p217
aVIn the collective unconscious, the soul of the human race.
p218
aVIn you, in me, mind and body and spirit.
p219
aVIn the tsunami, in the victims. In the depth of things.
p220
aVIn presence and in absence. In simplicity and complexity.
p221
aVIn change and development and growth.
p222
aa(lp223
VHow does this in-ness, this innerness, this interiority of God work?
p224
aVIt's hard to conceive, and begs more questions.
p225
aVIs God just another name for the universe,
p226
aVwith no independent existence at all?
p227
aVI don't know.
p228
aVTo what extent can we ascribe personality to God?
p229
aVI don't know.
p230
aVIn the end, we have to say, "I don't know."
p231
aVIf we knew, God would not be God.
p232
aa(lp233
VTo have faith in this God
p234
aVwould be more like trusting an essential benevolence in the universe,
p235
aVand less like believing a system of doctrinal statements.
p236
aVIsn't it ironic that Christians who claim to believe
p237
aVin an infinite, unknowable being
p238
aVthen tie God down in closed systems and rigid doctrines?
p239
aa(lp240
VHow could one practice such a faith?
p241
aVBy seeking the God within. By cultivating my own inwardness.
p242
aVIn silence, in meditation, in my inner space, in the me that remains
p243
aVwhen I gently put aside my passing emotions and ideas and preoccupations.
p244
aVIn awareness of the inner conversation.
p245
aa(lp246
VAnd how would we live such a faith? How would I live such a faith?
p247
aVBy seeking intimate connection with your inwardness.
p248
aVThe kind of relationships when deep speaks to deep.
p249
aVIf God is in all people, then there is a meeting place
p250
aVwhere my relationship with you becomes a three-way encounter.
p251
aVThere is an Indian greeting, which I'm sure some of you know:
p252
aV"Namaste," accompanied by a respectful bow,
p253
aVwhich, roughly translated means,
p254
aV"That which is of God in me greets that which of God is in you."
p255
aVNamaste.
p256
aa(lp257
VAnd how would one deepen such a faith?
p258
aVBy seeking the inwardness which is in all things.
p259
aVIn music and poetry, in the natural world of beauty
p260
aVand in the small ordinary things of life,
p261
aVthere is a deep, indwelling presence that makes them extraordinary.
p262
aVIt needs a profound attentiveness and a patient waiting,
p263
aVa contemplative attitude and a generosity and openness
p264
aVto those whose experience is different from my own.
p265
aa(lp266
VWhen I stood up to speak to my people about God and the tsunami,
p267
aVI had no answers to offer them.
p268
aVNo neat packages of faith, with Bible references to prove them.
p269
aVOnly doubts and questioning and uncertainty.
p270
aVI had some suggestions to make \u2014
p271
aVpossible new ways of thinking about God.
p272
aVWays that might allow us to go on, down a new and uncharted road.
p273
aVBut in the end, the only thing I could say for sure was, "I don't know,"
p274
aVand that just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all.
p275
aa(lp276
VThank you.

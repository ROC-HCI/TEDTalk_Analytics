VImagine if you could record your life \u2014
p5
aVeverything you said, everything you did,
p6
aVavailable in a perfect memory store at your fingertips,
p7
aVso you could go back
p8
aVand find memorable moments and relive them,
p9
aVor sift through traces of time
p10
aVand discover patterns in your own life
p11
aVthat previously had gone undiscovered.
p12
aVWell that's exactly the journey
p13
aVthat my family began
p14
aVfive and a half years ago.
p15
aVThis is my wife and collaborator, Rupal.
p16
aVAnd on this day, at this moment,
p17
aVwe walked into the house with our first child,
p18
aVour beautiful baby boy.
p19
aVAnd we walked into a house
p20
aVwith a very special home video recording system.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Video) Man: Okay.
p23
aa(lp24
VDeb Roy: This moment
p25
aVand thousands of other moments special for us
p26
aVwere captured in our home
p27
aVbecause in every room in the house,
p28
aVif you looked up, you'd see a camera and a microphone,
p29
aVand if you looked down,
p30
aVyou'd get this bird's-eye view of the room.
p31
aVHere's our living room,
p32
aVthe baby bedroom,
p33
aVkitchen, dining room
p34
aVand the rest of the house.
p35
aVAnd all of these fed into a disc array
p36
aVthat was designed for a continuous capture.
p37
aVSo here we are flying through a day in our home
p38
aVas we move from sunlit morning
p39
aVthrough incandescent evening
p40
aVand, finally, lights out for the day.
p41
aVOver the course of three years,
p42
aVwe recorded eight to 10 hours a day,
p43
aVamassing roughly a quarter-million hours
p44
aVof multi-track audio and video.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo you're looking at a piece of what is by far
p47
aVthe largest home video collection ever made.
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aVAnd what this data represents
p50
aVfor our family at a personal level,
p51
aVthe impact has already been immense,
p52
aVand we're still learning its value.
p53
aVCountless moments
p54
aVof unsolicited natural moments, not posed moments,
p55
aVare captured there,
p56
aVand we're starting to learn how to discover them and find them.
p57
aa(lp58
VBut there's also a scientific reason that drove this project,
p59
aVwhich was to use this natural longitudinal data
p60
aVto understand the process
p61
aVof how a child learns language \u2014
p62
aVthat child being my son.
p63
aVAnd so with many privacy provisions put in place
p64
aVto protect everyone who was recorded in the data,
p65
aVwe made elements of the data available
p66
aVto my trusted research team at MIT
p67
aVso we could start teasing apart patterns
p68
aVin this massive data set,
p69
aVtrying to understand the influence of social environments
p70
aVon language acquisition.
p71
aVSo we're looking here
p72
aVat one of the first things we started to do.
p73
aVThis is my wife and I cooking breakfast in the kitchen,
p74
aVand as we move through space and through time,
p75
aVa very everyday pattern of life in the kitchen.
p76
aa(lp77
VIn order to convert
p78
aVthis opaque, 90,000 hours of video
p79
aVinto something that we could start to see,
p80
aVwe use motion analysis to pull out,
p81
aVas we move through space and through time,
p82
aVwhat we call space-time worms.
p83
aVAnd this has become part of our toolkit
p84
aVfor being able to look and see
p85
aVwhere the activities are in the data,
p86
aVand with it, trace the pattern of, in particular,
p87
aVwhere my son moved throughout the home,
p88
aVso that we could focus our transcription efforts,
p89
aVall of the speech environment around my son \u2014
p90
aVall of the words that he heard from myself, my wife, our nanny,
p91
aVand over time, the words he began to produce.
p92
aVSo with that technology and that data
p93
aVand the ability to, with machine assistance,
p94
aVtranscribe speech,
p95
aVwe've now transcribed
p96
aVwell over seven million words of our home transcripts.
p97
aVAnd with that, let me take you now
p98
aVfor a first tour into the data.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo you've all, I'm sure,
p101
aVseen time-lapse videos
p102
aVwhere a flower will blossom as you accelerate time.
p103
aVI'd like you to now experience
p104
aVthe blossoming of a speech form.
p105
aVMy son, soon after his first birthday,
p106
aVwould say "gaga" to mean water.
p107
aVAnd over the course of the next half-year,
p108
aVhe slowly learned to approximate
p109
aVthe proper adult form, "water."
p110
aVSo we're going to cruise through half a year
p111
aVin about 40 seconds.
p112
aVNo video here,
p113
aVso you can focus on the sound, the acoustics,
p114
aVof a new kind of trajectory:
p115
aVgaga to water.
p116
aa(lp117
V(Audio) Baby: Gagagagagaga
p118
aVGaga gaga gaga
p119
aVguga guga guga
p120
aVwada gaga gaga guga gaga
p121
aVwader guga guga
p122
aVwater water water
p123
aVwater water water
p124
aVwater water
p125
aVwater.
p126
aa(lp127
VDR: He sure nailed it, didn't he.
p128
aa(lp129
V(Applause)
p130
aa(lp131
VSo he didn't just learn water.
p132
aVOver the course of the 24 months,
p133
aVthe first two years that we really focused on,
p134
aVthis is a map of every word he learned in chronological order.
p135
aVAnd because we have full transcripts,
p136
aVwe've identified each of the 503 words
p137
aVthat he learned to produce by his second birthday.
p138
aVHe was an early talker.
p139
aVAnd so we started to analyze why.
p140
aVWhy were certain words born before others?
p141
aVThis is one of the first results
p142
aVthat came out of our study a little over a year ago
p143
aVthat really surprised us.
p144
aVThe way to interpret this apparently simple graph
p145
aVis, on the vertical is an indication
p146
aVof how complex caregiver utterances are
p147
aVbased on the length of utterances.
p148
aVAnd the [horizontal] axis is time.
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd all of the data,
p151
aVwe aligned based on the following idea:
p152
aVEvery time my son would learn a word,
p153
aVwe would trace back and look at all of the language he heard
p154
aVthat contained that word.
p155
aVAnd we would plot the relative length of the utterances.
p156
aVAnd what we found was this curious phenomena,
p157
aVthat caregiver speech would systematically dip to a minimum,
p158
aVmaking language as simple as possible,
p159
aVand then slowly ascend back up in complexity.
p160
aVAnd the amazing thing was
p161
aVthat bounce, that dip,
p162
aVlined up almost precisely
p163
aVwith when each word was born \u2014
p164
aVword after word, systematically.
p165
aVSo it appears that all three primary caregivers \u2014
p166
aVmyself, my wife and our nanny \u2014
p167
aVwere systematically and, I would think, subconsciously
p168
aVrestructuring our language
p169
aVto meet him at the birth of a word
p170
aVand bring him gently into more complex language.
p171
aVAnd the implications of this \u2014 there are many,
p172
aVbut one I just want to point out,
p173
aVis that there must be amazing feedback loops.
p174
aVOf course, my son is learning
p175
aVfrom his linguistic environment,
p176
aVbut the environment is learning from him.
p177
aVThat environment, people, are in these tight feedback loops
p178
aVand creating a kind of scaffolding
p179
aVthat has not been noticed until now.
p180
aa(lp181
VBut that's looking at the speech context.
p182
aVWhat about the visual context?
p183
aVWe're not looking at \u2014
p184
aVthink of this as a dollhouse cutaway of our house.
p185
aVWe've taken those circular fish-eye lens cameras,
p186
aVand we've done some optical correction,
p187
aVand then we can bring it into three-dimensional life.
p188
aVSo welcome to my home.
p189
aVThis is a moment,
p190
aVone moment captured across multiple cameras.
p191
aVThe reason we did this is to create the ultimate memory machine,
p192
aVwhere you can go back and interactively fly around
p193
aVand then breathe video-life into this system.
p194
aVWhat I'm going to do
p195
aVis give you an accelerated view of 30 minutes,
p196
aVagain, of just life in the living room.
p197
aVThat's me and my son on the floor.
p198
aVAnd there's video analytics
p199
aVthat are tracking our movements.
p200
aVMy son is leaving red ink. I am leaving green ink.
p201
aVWe're now on the couch,
p202
aVlooking out through the window at cars passing by.
p203
aVAnd finally, my son playing in a walking toy by himself.
p204
aa(lp205
VNow we freeze the action, 30 minutes,
p206
aVwe turn time into the vertical axis,
p207
aVand we open up for a view
p208
aVof these interaction traces we've just left behind.
p209
aVAnd we see these amazing structures \u2014
p210
aVthese little knots of two colors of thread
p211
aVwe call "social hot spots."
p212
aVThe spiral thread
p213
aVwe call a "solo hot spot."
p214
aVAnd we think that these affect the way language is learned.
p215
aVWhat we'd like to do
p216
aVis start understanding
p217
aVthe interaction between these patterns
p218
aVand the language that my son is exposed to
p219
aVto see if we can predict
p220
aVhow the structure of when words are heard
p221
aVaffects when they're learned \u2014
p222
aVso in other words, the relationship
p223
aVbetween words and what they're about in the world.
p224
aa(lp225
VSo here's how we're approaching this.
p226
aVIn this video,
p227
aVagain, my son is being traced out.
p228
aVHe's leaving red ink behind.
p229
aVAnd there's our nanny by the door.
p230
aa(lp231
V(Video) Nanny: You want water? (Baby: Aaaa.)
p232
aVNanny: All right. (Baby: Aaaa.)
p233
aa(lp234
VDR: She offers water,
p235
aVand off go the two worms
p236
aVover to the kitchen to get water.
p237
aVAnd what we've done is use the word "water"
p238
aVto tag that moment, that bit of activity.
p239
aVAnd now we take the power of data
p240
aVand take every time my son
p241
aVever heard the word water
p242
aVand the context he saw it in,
p243
aVand we use it to penetrate through the video
p244
aVand find every activity trace
p245
aVthat co-occurred with an instance of water.
p246
aVAnd what this data leaves in its wake
p247
aVis a landscape.
p248
aVWe call these wordscapes.
p249
aVThis is the wordscape for the word water,
p250
aVand you can see most of the action is in the kitchen.
p251
aVThat's where those big peaks are over to the left.
p252
aVAnd just for contrast, we can do this with any word.
p253
aVWe can take the word "bye"
p254
aVas in "good bye."
p255
aVAnd we're now zoomed in over the entrance to the house.
p256
aVAnd we look, and we find, as you would expect,
p257
aVa contrast in the landscape
p258
aVwhere the word "bye" occurs much more in a structured way.
p259
aVSo we're using these structures
p260
aVto start predicting
p261
aVthe order of language acquisition,
p262
aVand that's ongoing work now.
p263
aa(lp264
VIn my lab, which we're peering into now, at MIT \u2014
p265
aVthis is at the media lab.
p266
aVThis has become my favorite way
p267
aVof videographing just about any space.
p268
aVThree of the key people in this project,
p269
aVPhilip DeCamp, Rony Kubat and Brandon Roy are pictured here.
p270
aVPhilip has been a close collaborator
p271
aVon all the visualizations you're seeing.
p272
aVAnd Michael Fleischman
p273
aVwas another Ph.D. student in my lab
p274
aVwho worked with me on this home video analysis,
p275
aVand he made the following observation:
p276
aVthat "just the way that we're analyzing
p277
aVhow language connects to events
p278
aVwhich provide common ground for language,
p279
aVthat same idea we can take out of your home, Deb,
p280
aVand we can apply it to the world of public media."
p281
aVAnd so our effort took an unexpected turn.
p282
aa(lp283
VThink of mass media
p284
aVas providing common ground
p285
aVand you have the recipe
p286
aVfor taking this idea to a whole new place.
p287
aVWe've started analyzing television content
p288
aVusing the same principles \u2014
p289
aVanalyzing event structure of a TV signal \u2014
p290
aVepisodes of shows,
p291
aVcommercials,
p292
aVall of the components that make up the event structure.
p293
aVAnd we're now, with satellite dishes, pulling and analyzing
p294
aVa good part of all the TV being watched in the United States.
p295
aVAnd you don't have to now go and instrument living rooms with microphones
p296
aVto get people's conversations,
p297
aVyou just tune into publicly available social media feeds.
p298
aa(lp299
VSo we're pulling in
p300
aVabout three billion comments a month,
p301
aVand then the magic happens.
p302
aVYou have the event structure,
p303
aVthe common ground that the words are about,
p304
aVcoming out of the television feeds;
p305
aVyou've got the conversations
p306
aVthat are about those topics;
p307
aVand through semantic analysis \u2014
p308
aVand this is actually real data you're looking at
p309
aVfrom our data processing \u2014
p310
aVeach yellow line is showing a link being made
p311
aVbetween a comment in the wild
p312
aVand a piece of event structure coming out of the television signal.
p313
aVAnd the same idea now
p314
aVcan be built up.
p315
aVAnd we get this wordscape,
p316
aVexcept now words are not assembled in my living room.
p317
aVInstead, the context, the common ground activities,
p318
aVare the content on television that's driving the conversations.
p319
aVAnd what we're seeing here, these skyscrapers now,
p320
aVare commentary
p321
aVthat are linked to content on television.
p322
aVSame concept,
p323
aVbut looking at communication dynamics
p324
aVin a very different sphere.
p325
aa(lp326
VAnd so fundamentally, rather than, for example,
p327
aVmeasuring content based on how many people are watching,
p328
aVthis gives us the basic data
p329
aVfor looking at engagement properties of content.
p330
aVAnd just like we can look at feedback cycles
p331
aVand dynamics in a family,
p332
aVwe can now open up the same concepts
p333
aVand look at much larger groups of people.
p334
aVThis is a subset of data from our database \u2014
p335
aVjust 50,000 out of several million \u2014
p336
aVand the social graph that connects them
p337
aVthrough publicly available sources.
p338
aVAnd if you put them on one plain,
p339
aVa second plain is where the content lives.
p340
aVSo we have the programs
p341
aVand the sporting events
p342
aVand the commercials,
p343
aVand all of the link structures that tie them together
p344
aVmake a content graph.
p345
aVAnd then the important third dimension.
p346
aVEach of the links that you're seeing rendered here
p347
aVis an actual connection made
p348
aVbetween something someone said
p349
aVand a piece of content.
p350
aVAnd there are, again, now tens of millions of these links
p351
aVthat give us the connective tissue of social graphs
p352
aVand how they relate to content.
p353
aVAnd we can now start to probe the structure
p354
aVin interesting ways.
p355
aa(lp356
VSo if we, for example, trace the path
p357
aVof one piece of content
p358
aVthat drives someone to comment on it,
p359
aVand then we follow where that comment goes,
p360
aVand then look at the entire social graph that becomes activated
p361
aVand then trace back to see the relationship
p362
aVbetween that social graph and content,
p363
aVa very interesting structure becomes visible.
p364
aVWe call this a co-viewing clique,
p365
aVa virtual living room if you will.
p366
aVAnd there are fascinating dynamics at play.
p367
aVIt's not one way.
p368
aVA piece of content, an event, causes someone to talk.
p369
aVThey talk to other people.
p370
aVThat drives tune-in behavior back into mass media,
p371
aVand you have these cycles
p372
aVthat drive the overall behavior.
p373
aa(lp374
VAnother example \u2014 very different \u2014
p375
aVanother actual person in our database \u2014
p376
aVand we're finding at least hundreds, if not thousands, of these.
p377
aVWe've given this person a name.
p378
aVThis is a pro-amateur, or pro-am media critic
p379
aVwho has this high fan-out rate.
p380
aVSo a lot of people are following this person \u2014 very influential \u2014
p381
aVand they have a propensity to talk about what's on TV.
p382
aVSo this person is a key link
p383
aVin connecting mass media and social media together.
p384
aa(lp385
VOne last example from this data:
p386
aVSometimes it's actually a piece of content that is special.
p387
aVSo if we go and look at this piece of content,
p388
aVPresident Obama's State of the Union address
p389
aVfrom just a few weeks ago,
p390
aVand look at what we find in this same data set,
p391
aVat the same scale,
p392
aVthe engagement properties of this piece of content
p393
aVare truly remarkable.
p394
aVA nation exploding in conversation
p395
aVin real time
p396
aVin response to what's on the broadcast.
p397
aVAnd of course, through all of these lines
p398
aVare flowing unstructured language.
p399
aVWe can X-ray
p400
aVand get a real-time pulse of a nation,
p401
aVreal-time sense
p402
aVof the social reactions in the different circuits in the social graph
p403
aVbeing activated by content.
p404
aa(lp405
VSo, to summarize, the idea is this:
p406
aVAs our world becomes increasingly instrumented
p407
aVand we have the capabilities
p408
aVto collect and connect the dots
p409
aVbetween what people are saying
p410
aVand the context they're saying it in,
p411
aVwhat's emerging is an ability
p412
aVto see new social structures and dynamics
p413
aVthat have previously not been seen.
p414
aVIt's like building a microscope or telescope
p415
aVand revealing new structures
p416
aVabout our own behavior around communication.
p417
aVAnd I think the implications here are profound,
p418
aVwhether it's for science,
p419
aVfor commerce, for government,
p420
aVor perhaps most of all,
p421
aVfor us as individuals.
p422
aa(lp423
VAnd so just to return to my son,
p424
aVwhen I was preparing this talk, he was looking over my shoulder,
p425
aVand I showed him the clips I was going to show to you today,
p426
aVand I asked him for permission \u2014 granted.
p427
aVAnd then I went on to reflect,
p428
aV"Isn't it amazing,
p429
aVthis entire database, all these recordings,
p430
aVI'm going to hand off to you and to your sister" \u2014
p431
aVwho arrived two years later \u2014
p432
aV"and you guys are going to be able to go back and re-experience moments
p433
aVthat you could never, with your biological memory,
p434
aVpossibly remember the way you can now?"
p435
aVAnd he was quiet for a moment.
p436
aVAnd I thought, "What am I thinking?
p437
aVHe's five years old. He's not going to understand this."
p438
aVAnd just as I was having that thought, he looked up at me and said,
p439
aV"So that when I grow up,
p440
aVI can show this to my kids?"
p441
aVAnd I thought, "Wow, this is powerful stuff."
p442
aa(lp443
VSo I want to leave you
p444
aVwith one last memorable moment
p445
aVfrom our family.
p446
aVThis is the first time our son
p447
aVtook more than two steps at once \u2014
p448
aVcaptured on film.
p449
aVAnd I really want you to focus on something
p450
aVas I take you through.
p451
aVIt's a cluttered environment; it's natural life.
p452
aVMy mother's in the kitchen, cooking,
p453
aVand, of all places, in the hallway,
p454
aVI realize he's about to do it, about to take more than two steps.
p455
aVAnd so you hear me encouraging him,
p456
aVrealizing what's happening,
p457
aVand then the magic happens.
p458
aVListen very carefully.
p459
aVAbout three steps in,
p460
aVhe realizes something magic is happening,
p461
aVand the most amazing feedback loop of all kicks in,
p462
aVand he takes a breath in,
p463
aVand he whispers "wow"
p464
aVand instinctively I echo back the same.
p465
aVAnd so let's fly back in time
p466
aVto that memorable moment.
p467
aa(lp468
V(Video) DR: Hey.
p469
aVCome here.
p470
aVCan you do it?
p471
aVOh, boy.
p472
aVCan you do it?
p473
aVBaby: Yeah.
p474
aVDR: Ma, he's walking.

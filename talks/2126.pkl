VSo, I thought a lot about the first word I'd say today,
p5
aVand I decided to say "Colombia."
p6
aVAnd the reason, I don't know how many of you have visited Colombia,
p7
aVbut Colombia is just north of the border with Brazil.
p8
aVIt's a beautiful country
p9
aVwith extraordinary people, like me and others \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p10
aVand it's populated with incredible fauna, flora.
p11
aVIt's got water; it's got everything to be the perfect place.
p12
aa(lp13
VBut we have a few problems.
p14
aVYou may have heard of some of them.
p15
aVWe have the oldest standing guerrilla in the world.
p16
aVIt's been around for over 50 years,
p17
aVwhich means that in my lifetime,
p18
aVI have never lived one day  of peace in my country.
p19
aVThis guerrilla \u2014 and the main group is the FARC guerrillas,
p20
aVRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia \u2014
p21
aVthey have financed their war by kidnapping, by extortion,
p22
aVby getting into the drug trade, by illegal mining.
p23
aVThere has been terrorism. There have been random bombs.
p24
aVSo it's not good. It's not really good.
p25
aVAnd if you look at the human cost of this war over 50 years,
p26
aVwe have had more than 5.7 million displaced population.
p27
aVIt's one of the biggest displaced populations in the world,
p28
aVand this conflict has cost over 220,000 lives.
p29
aVSo it's a little bit like the Bolívar wars again.
p30
aVIt's a lot of people who have died unnecessarily.
p31
aa(lp32
VWe are now in the middle of peace talks,
p33
aVand we've been trying to help resolve this problem peacefully,
p34
aVand as part of that,
p35
aVwe decided to try something completely lateral and different:
p36
aVChristmas lights.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo Christmas lights, and you're saying,
p39
aVwhat the hell is this guy going to talk about?
p40
aVI am going to talk about gigantic trees
p41
aVthat we put in nine strategic  pathways in the jungle
p42
aVcovered with Christmas lights.
p43
aVThese trees helped us  demobilize 331 guerrillas,
p44
aVroughly five percent of the guerrilla force at the time.
p45
aVThese trees were lit up at night,
p46
aVand they had a sign beside them
p47
aVthat said, "If Christmas can come to the jungle, you can come home.
p48
aVDemobilize.
p49
aVAt Christmas, everything is possible."
p50
aa(lp51
VSo how do we know these trees worked?
p52
aVWell, we got 331, which is okay,
p53
aVbut we also know that not a lot of guerrillas saw them,
p54
aVbut we know that a lot of guerrillas heard about them,
p55
aVand we know this
p56
aVbecause we are constantly talking to demobilized guerrillas.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo let me take you back four years before the trees.
p59
aVFour years before the trees, we were approached by the government
p60
aVto help them come up with a communications strategy
p61
aVto get as many guerrillas as we could out of the jungle.
p62
aVThe government had a military strategy,
p63
aVit had a legal strategy,
p64
aVit had a political strategy, but it said,
p65
aV"We don't really have a communications strategy,
p66
aVand it probably would be a good thing to have,"
p67
aVso we decided to immediately jump into this,
p68
aVbecause it is an opportunity to affect the outcome of the conflict
p69
aVwith the things that we do, with the tools that we have.
p70
aa(lp71
VBut we didn't know very much about it.
p72
aVWe didn't understand in Colombia,  if you live in the cities,
p73
aVyou're very far away from where  the war is actually happening,
p74
aVso you don't really understand it,
p75
aVand we asked the government  to give us access
p76
aVto as many demobilized guerrillas as possible.
p77
aVAnd we talked to about 60 of them
p78
aVbefore we felt we fully understood the problem.
p79
aVWe talked about \u2014 they told us why  they had joined the guerrillas,
p80
aVwhy the left the guerrillas, what their dreams were,
p81
aVwhat their frustrations were,
p82
aVand from those conversations came the underlying insight
p83
aVthat has guided this whole campaign,
p84
aVwhich is that guerrillas are as much prisoners of their organizations
p85
aVas the people they hold hostage.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd at the beginning, we were so touched by these stories,
p88
aVwe were so amazed by these stories,
p89
aVthat we thought that maybe  the best way to talk to the guerrillas
p90
aVwas to have them talk to themselves,
p91
aVso we recorded about a hundred different stories during the first year,
p92
aVand we put them on the radio and television
p93
aVso that the guerrillas in the jungle could hear stories, their stories,
p94
aVor stories similar to theirs,
p95
aVand when they heard them, they decided to go out.
p96
aa(lp97
VI want to tell you one of these stories.
p98
aVThis person you see here  is Giovanni Andres.
p99
aVGiovanni Andres is 25 when we took that picture.
p100
aVHe had been seven years in the guerrilla, and he had demobilized very recently.
p101
aVHis story is the following:
p102
aVHe was recruited when he was 17,
p103
aVand sometime later, in his squadron, if you will,
p104
aVthis beautiful girl was recruited, and they fell in love.
p105
aVTheir conversations were about what their family was going to be like,
p106
aVwhat their kids' names would be,
p107
aVhow their life would be when they left the guerrilla.
p108
aVBut it turns out
p109
aVthat love is very strictly forbidden in the lower ranks of the guerrilla,
p110
aVso their romance was discovered and they were separated.
p111
aVHe was sent very far away, and she was left behind.
p112
aVShe was very familiar with the territory,
p113
aVso one night, when she was on guard,
p114
aVshe just left,
p115
aVand she went to the army, she demobilized,
p116
aVand she was one of the persons that we had the fortune to talk to,
p117
aVand we were really touched by this story,
p118
aVso we made a radio spot,
p119
aVand it turns out, by chance,
p120
aVthat far away, many,  many kilometers north,
p121
aVhe heard her on the radio,
p122
aVand when he heard her on the radio, he said, "What am I doing here?
p123
aVShe had the balls to get out. I need to do the same thing."
p124
aVAnd he did.
p125
aVHe walked for two days and two nights,
p126
aVand he risked his life and he got out,
p127
aVand the only thing he wanted was to see her.
p128
aVThe only thing that was in his mind was to see her.
p129
aVThe story was, they did meet.
p130
aVI know you're wondering if they did meet.
p131
aVThey did meet.
p132
aVShe had been recruited when she was 15, and she left when she was 17,
p133
aVso there were a lot of other complications,
p134
aVbut they did eventually meet.
p135
aVI don't know if they're together now, but I can find out. (Laughter)
p136
aVBut what I can tell you is that our radio strategy was working.
p137
aa(lp138
VThe problem is that it was working in the lower ranks of the guerrilla.
p139
aVIt was not working with the commanders,
p140
aVthe people that are more difficult to replace,
p141
aVbecause you can easily recruit but you can't get the older commanders.
p142
aVSo we thought, well, we'll use the same strategy.
p143
aVWe'll have commanders talking to commanders.
p144
aVAnd we even went as far as asking ex-commanders of the guerrilla
p145
aVto fly on helicopters with microphones
p146
aVtelling the people that used to fight with them,
p147
aV"There is a better life out there,"
p148
aV"I'm doing good," "This is not worth it," etc.
p149
aVBut, as you can all imagine, it was very easy to counteract,
p150
aVbecause what was the guerrilla going to say?
p151
aV"Yeah, right, if he doesn't do that, he's going to get killed."
p152
aVSo it was easy, so we were suddenly left with nothing,
p153
aVbecause the guerrilla were spreading the word
p154
aVthat all of those things are done
p155
aVbecause if they don't do it,  they're in danger.
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd somebody, some brilliant person in our team,
p158
aVcame back and said, "You know what I noticed?
p159
aVI noticed that around Christmastime,
p160
aVthere have been peaks of demobilization
p161
aVsince this war has started."
p162
aVAnd that was incredible,
p163
aVbecause that led us to think  that we needed to talk to the human being
p164
aVand not to the soldier.
p165
aVWe needed to step away from talking
p166
aVfrom government to army, from army to army,
p167
aVand we needed to talk about the universal values,
p168
aVand we needed to talk about humanity.
p169
aVAnd that was when the Christmas tree happened.
p170
aVThis picture that I have here,
p171
aVyou see this is the planning of the Christmas trees,
p172
aVand that man you see there with the three stars,
p173
aVhe's Captain Juan Manuel Valdez.
p174
aVCaptain Valdez was the first  high-ranking official
p175
aVto give us the helicopters  and the support we needed
p176
aVto put these Christmas trees up,
p177
aVand he said in that meeting something that I will never forget.
p178
aVHe said, "I want to do this because being generous makes me stronger,
p179
aVmakes my men feel stronger."
p180
aVAnd I get very emotional when I remember him
p181
aVbecause he was killed later in combat and we really miss him,
p182
aVbut I wanted you all to see him, because he was really, really important.
p183
aVHe gave us all the support to put up the first Christmas trees.
p184
aa(lp185
VWhat happened later is that the guerrillas who came out
p186
aVduring the Christmas tree  operation and all of that
p187
aVsaid, "That's really good, Christmas trees are really cool,
p188
aVbut you know what? We really don't walk anymore.
p189
aVWe use rivers."
p190
aa(lp191
VSo rivers are the highways of the jungle,
p192
aVand this is something we learned,
p193
aVand most of the recruiting was being done in and around the river villages.
p194
aVSo we went to these river villages,
p195
aVand we asked the people,
p196
aVand probably some of them were direct acquaintances of the guerrillas.
p197
aVWe asked them, "Can you send guerrillas a message?"
p198
aVWe collected over 6,000 messages.
p199
aVSome of them were notes saying, get out.
p200
aVSome of them were toys. Some of them were candy.
p201
aVEven people took off their jewelry, their little crosses and religious things,
p202
aVand put them in these floating balls that we sent down the rivers
p203
aVso that they could be picked up at night.
p204
aVAnd we sent thousands of these down the rivers,
p205
aVand then picked them up later if they weren't.
p206
aVBut lots of them were picked up.
p207
aVThis generated, on average, a demobilization every six hours,
p208
aVso this was incredible and it was about: Come home at Christmas.
p209
aa(lp210
VThen came the peace process,
p211
aVand when the peace process started,
p212
aVthe whole mindset of the guerrilla changed.
p213
aVAnd it changed because
p214
aVit makes you think, "Well, if there's a peace process,
p215
aVthis is probably going to be over.
p216
aVAt some point I'm going to get out."
p217
aVAnd their fears completely changed,
p218
aVand their fears were not about, "Am I going to get killed?"
p219
aVTheir fears were, "Am I going to be rejected?
p220
aVWhen I get out of this, am I going to be rejected?"
p221
aVSo the past Christmas,  what we did was we asked \u2014
p222
aVwe found 27 mothers of guerrillas,
p223
aVand we asked them to give us  pictures of their children,
p224
aVwhen they only could recognize themselves, so as not to put their lives in danger,
p225
aVand we asked them to give the most motherly message you can get,
p226
aVwhich is, "Before you were a guerrilla, you were my child,
p227
aVso come home, I'm waiting for you."
p228
aVYou can see the pictures here. I'll show you a couple.
p229
aV(Applause)
p230
aVThank you.
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd these pictures were placed in many different places,
p233
aVand a lot of them came back,
p234
aVand it was really, really beautiful.
p235
aa(lp236
VAnd then we decided to work with society.
p237
aVSo we did mothers around Christmastime.
p238
aVNow let's talk about the rest of the people.
p239
aVAnd you may be aware of this or not, but there was a World Cup this year,
p240
aVand Colombia played really well, and it was a unifying moment for Colombia.
p241
aVAnd what we did was tell the guerrillas,
p242
aV"Come, get out of the jungle. We're saving a place for you."
p243
aVSo this was television, this was  all different types of media saying,
p244
aV"We are saving a place for you."
p245
aVThe soldier here in the commercial says,
p246
aV"I'm saving a place for you right here in this helicopter
p247
aVso that you can get out of this jungle and go enjoy the World Cup."
p248
aVEx-football players, radio announcers,
p249
aVeverybody was saving a place for the guerrilla.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo since we started this work a little over eight years ago,
p252
aV17,000 guerrillas have demobilized.
p253
aVI do not \u2014 (Applause)
p254
aa(lp255
VThank you.
p256
aa(lp257
VI don't want to say in any way that it only has to do with what we do,
p258
aVbut what I do know is that our work and the work that we do
p259
aVmay have helped a lot of them start thinking about demobilization,
p260
aVand it may have helped a lot of them take the final decision.
p261
aVIf that is true, advertising is still one of the most powerful tools of change
p262
aVthat we have available.
p263
aVAnd I speak not only my behalf,
p264
aVbut on behalf of all the colleagues I see here
p265
aVwho work in advertising,
p266
aVand of all the team that has worked with me to do this,
p267
aVthat if you want to change the world,
p268
aVor if you want to achieve  peace, please call us.
p269
aVWe'd love to help.
p270
aa(lp271
VThank you.

At Christmas 2010, his agency, Lowe-SSP3 Colombia, placed nine decorated holiday trees in the jungle near a banner ad that read: &quot;If Christmas can come to the jungle, you can come home. Demobilize.&quot; It won gold at Cannes Lions -- but the most important prize was that it succeeded in its intent, creating a spike in demobilization rates.<br />&nbsp;<br />The following year the agency planned a poetic campaign called &quot;Rivers of Light&quot; (Operaci&oacute;n R&iacute;os de Luz), which floated a raft of glowing plastic balls, filled with gifts and messages from family, down rivers that the revolutionaries typically travel. Christmas 2012&#39;s campaign, &quot;Operation Bethlehem,&quot; lit up wayfinding &quot;stars&quot; over local villages, offering defectors a route back.<br />&nbsp;<br />Meanwhile, Sokoloff&#39;s agency also handles large global consumer clients like Unilever, as well as the Colombian newspaper<em> El Espectador.</em>", "slug": "jose_miguel_sokoloff", "whotheyare": "Ad exec Jose Miguel Sokoloff has led a multi-year marketing campaign that\'s helped Colombian guerrillas realize that they are wanted back home.", "whatotherssay": "Not many ad agency briefs aim to tackle something as important as the demobilisation of a guerrilla army.", "id": 1581, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/0e312c05f502b64e52f23f379e078f4dc7b4d1df_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "How Christmas lights helped guerrillas put down their guns", "take_action": null, "comments": 26744, "more_resources": null, "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/7fc9f7f91c5958e05e56755132a827956d611419_2880x1620.jpg", "description": "\\u201cIn my lifetime, I have never lived one day of peace in my country,\\u201d says Jose Miguel Sokoloff.

VTonight, I want to have a conversation about
p5
aVthis incredible global issue
p6
aVthat's at the intersection of land use, food and environment,
p7
aVsomething we can all relate to,
p8
aVand what I've been calling the other inconvenient truth.
p9
aa(lp10
VBut first, I want to take you on a little journey.
p11
aVLet's first visit our planet, but at night,
p12
aVand from space.
p13
aVThis is what our planet looks like from outer space
p14
aVat nighttime, if you were to take a satellite and travel
p15
aVaround the planet. And the thing you would notice first,
p16
aVof course, is how dominant the human presence
p17
aVon our planet is.
p18
aVWe see cities, we see oil fields,
p19
aVyou can even make out fishing fleets in the sea,
p20
aVthat we are dominating much of our planet,
p21
aVand mostly through the use of energy
p22
aVthat we see here at night.
p23
aVBut let's go back and drop it a little deeper
p24
aVand look during the daytime.
p25
aVWhat we see during the day is our landscapes.
p26
aa(lp27
VThis is part of the Amazon Basin, a place called Rondônia
p28
aVin the south-center part of the Brazilian Amazon.
p29
aVIf you look really carefully in the upper right-hand corner,
p30
aVyou're going to see a thin white line,
p31
aVwhich is a road that was built in the 1970s.
p32
aVIf we come back to the same place in 2001,
p33
aVwhat we're going to find is that these roads
p34
aVspurt off more roads, and more roads after that,
p35
aVat the end of which is a small clearing in the rainforest
p36
aVwhere there are going to be a few cows.
p37
aVThese cows are used for beef. We're going to eat these cows.
p38
aVAnd these cows are eaten basically in South America,
p39
aVin Brazil and Argentina. They're not being shipped up here.
p40
aVBut this kind of fishbone pattern of deforestation
p41
aVis something we notice a lot of around the tropics,
p42
aVespecially in this part of the world.
p43
aa(lp44
VIf we go a little bit further south in our little tour of the world,
p45
aVwe can go to the Bolivian edge of the Amazon,
p46
aVhere also in 1975, and if you look really carefully,
p47
aVthere's a thin white line through that kind of seam,
p48
aVand there's a lone farmer out there
p49
aVin the middle of the primeval jungle.
p50
aVLet's come back again a few years later, here in 2003,
p51
aVand we'll see that that landscape actually looks
p52
aVa lot more like Iowa than it does like a rainforest.
p53
aVIn fact, what you're seeing here are soybean fields.
p54
aVThese soybeans are being shipped to Europe and to China
p55
aVas animal feed, especially after the mad cow disease scare
p56
aVabout a decade ago, where we don't want to feed animals
p57
aVanimal protein anymore, because that can transmit disease.
p58
aVInstead, we want to feed them more vegetable proteins.
p59
aVSo soybeans have really exploded,
p60
aVshowing how trade and globalization are
p61
aVreally responsible for the connections to rainforests
p62
aVand the Amazon \u2014 an incredibly strange
p63
aVand interconnected world that we have today.
p64
aa(lp65
VWell, again and again, what we find as we look
p66
aVaround the world in our little tour of the world
p67
aVis that landscape after landscape after landscape
p68
aVhave been cleared and altered for growing food
p69
aVand other crops.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo one of the questions we've been asking is,
p72
aVhow much of the world is used to grow food,
p73
aVand where is it exactly, and how can we change that
p74
aVinto the future, and what does it mean?
p75
aVWell, our team has been looking at this on a global scale,
p76
aVusing satellite data and ground-based data kind of to track
p77
aVfarming on a global scale.
p78
aVAnd this is what we found, and it's startling.
p79
aVThis map shows the presence of agriculture
p80
aVon planet Earth.
p81
aVThe green areas are the areas we use to grow crops,
p82
aVlike wheat or soybeans or corn or rice or whatever.
p83
aVThat's 16 million square kilometers' worth of land.
p84
aVIf you put it all together in one place,
p85
aVit'd be the size of South America.
p86
aVThe second area, in brown, is the world's pastures
p87
aVand rangelands, where our animals live.
p88
aVThat area's about 30 million square kilometers,
p89
aVor about an Africa's worth of land,
p90
aVa huge amount of land, and it's the best land, of course,
p91
aVis what you see. And what's left is, like,
p92
aVthe middle of the Sahara Desert, or Siberia,
p93
aVor the middle of a rain forest.
p94
aVWe're using a planet's worth of land already.
p95
aVIf we look at this carefully, we find it's about 40 percent
p96
aVof the Earth's land surface is devoted to agriculture,
p97
aVand it's 60 times larger
p98
aVthan all the areas we complain about,
p99
aVour suburban sprawl and our cities where we mostly live.
p100
aVHalf of humanity lives in cities today,
p101
aVbut a 60-times-larger area is used to grow food.
p102
aVSo this is an amazing kind of result,
p103
aVand it really shocked us when we looked at that.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo we're using an enormous amount of land for agriculture,
p106
aVbut also we're using a lot of water.
p107
aVThis is a photograph flying into Arizona,
p108
aVand when you look at it, you're like,
p109
aV"What are they growing here?" It turns out
p110
aVthey're growing lettuce in the middle of the desert
p111
aVusing water sprayed on top.
p112
aVNow, the irony is, it's probably sold
p113
aVin our supermarket shelves in the Twin Cities.
p114
aVBut what's really interesting is, this water's got to come
p115
aVfrom some place, and it comes from here,
p116
aVthe Colorado River in North America.
p117
aVWell, the Colorado on a typical day in the 1950s,
p118
aVthis is just, you know, not a flood, not a drought,
p119
aVkind of an average day, it looks something like this.
p120
aVBut if we come back today, during a normal condition
p121
aVto the exact same location, this is what's left.
p122
aVThe difference is mainly irrigating the desert for food,
p123
aVor maybe golf courses in Scottsdale, you take your pick.
p124
aVWell, this is a lot of water, and again, we're mining water
p125
aVand using it to grow food,
p126
aVand today, if you travel down further down the Colorado,
p127
aVit dries up completely and no longer flows into the ocean.
p128
aVWe've literally consumed an entire river in North America
p129
aVfor irrigation.
p130
aa(lp131
VWell, that's not even the worst example in the world.
p132
aVThis probably is: the Aral Sea.
p133
aVNow, a lot you will remember this from your geography classes.
p134
aVThis is in the former Soviet Union
p135
aVin between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan,
p136
aVone of the great inland seas of the world.
p137
aVBut there's kind of a paradox here, because it looks like
p138
aVit's surrounded by desert. Why is this sea here?
p139
aVThe reason it's here is because, on the right-hand side,
p140
aVyou see two little rivers kind of coming down
p141
aVthrough the sand, feeding this basin with water.
p142
aVThose rivers are draining snowmelt from mountains
p143
aVfar to the east, where snow melts, it travels down the river
p144
aVthrough the desert, and forms the great Aral Sea.
p145
aVWell, in the 1950s, the Soviets decided to divert that water
p146
aVto irrigate the desert to grow cotton, believe it or not,
p147
aVin Kazakhstan, to sell cotton to the international markets
p148
aVto bring foreign currency into the Soviet Union.
p149
aVThey really needed the money.
p150
aVWell, you can imagine what happens. You turn off
p151
aVthe water supply to the Aral Sea, what's going to happen?
p152
aVHere it is in 1973,
p153
aV1986,
p154
aV1999,
p155
aV2004,
p156
aVand about 11 months ago.
p157
aVIt's pretty extraordinary.
p158
aVNow a lot of us in the audience here live in the Midwest.
p159
aVImagine that was Lake Superior.
p160
aVImagine that was Lake Huron.
p161
aVIt's an extraordinary change.
p162
aa(lp163
VThis is not only a change in water and
p164
aVwhere the shoreline is, this is a change in the fundamentals
p165
aVof the environment of this region.
p166
aVLet's start with this.
p167
aVThe Soviet Union didn't really have a Sierra Club.
p168
aVLet's put it that way.
p169
aVSo what you find in the bottom of the Aral Sea ain't pretty.
p170
aVThere's a lot of toxic waste, a lot of things
p171
aVthat were dumped there that are now becoming airborne.
p172
aVOne of those small islands that was remote
p173
aVand impossible to get to was a site
p174
aVof Soviet biological weapons testing.
p175
aVYou can walk there today.
p176
aVWeather patterns have changed.
p177
aVNineteen of the unique 20 fish species found only
p178
aVin the Aral Sea are now wiped off the face of the Earth.
p179
aVThis is an environmental disaster writ large.
p180
aa(lp181
VBut let's bring it home.
p182
aVThis is a picture that Al Gore gave me a few years ago
p183
aVthat he took when he was in the Soviet Union
p184
aVa long, long time ago,
p185
aVshowing the fishing fleets of the Aral Sea.
p186
aVYou see the canal they dug?
p187
aVThey were so desperate to try to, kind of, float the boats into
p188
aVthe remaining pools of water, but they finally had to give up
p189
aVbecause the piers and the moorings simply couldn't
p190
aVkeep up with the retreating shoreline.
p191
aVI don't know about you, but I'm terrified that future
p192
aVarchaeologists will dig this up and write stories about
p193
aVour time in history, and wonder, "What were you thinking?"
p194
aVWell, that's the future we have to look forward to.
p195
aa(lp196
VWe already use about 50 percent of the Earth's fresh water
p197
aVthat's sustainable, and agriculture alone
p198
aVis 70 percent of that.
p199
aVSo we use a lot of water, a lot of land for agriculture.
p200
aVWe also use a lot of the atmosphere for agriculture.
p201
aVUsually when we think about the atmosphere,
p202
aVwe think about climate change and greenhouse gases,
p203
aVand mostly around energy,
p204
aVbut it turns out agriculture is one of the biggest emitters
p205
aVof greenhouse gases too.
p206
aVIf you look at carbon dioxide from
p207
aVburning tropical rainforest,
p208
aVor methane coming from cows and rice,
p209
aVor nitrous oxide from too many fertilizers,
p210
aVit turns out agriculture is 30 percent of the greenhouse
p211
aVgases going into the atmosphere from human activity.
p212
aVThat's more than all our transportation.
p213
aVIt's more than all our electricity.
p214
aVIt's more than all other manufacturing, in fact.
p215
aVIt's the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases
p216
aVof any human activity in the world.
p217
aVAnd yet, we don't talk about it very much.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo we have this incredible presence today of agriculture
p220
aVdominating our planet,
p221
aVwhether it's 40 percent of our land surface,
p222
aV70 percent of the water we use,
p223
aV30 percent of our greenhouse gas emissions.
p224
aVWe've doubled the flows of nitrogen and phosphorus
p225
aVaround the world simply by using fertilizers,
p226
aVcausing huge problems of water quality from rivers,
p227
aVlakes, and even oceans, and it's also the single biggest
p228
aVdriver of biodiversity loss.
p229
aVSo without a doubt, agriculture is
p230
aVthe single most powerful force unleashed on this planet
p231
aVsince the end of the ice age. No question.
p232
aVAnd it rivals climate change in importance.
p233
aVAnd they're both happening at the same time.
p234
aa(lp235
VBut what's really important here to remember is that
p236
aVit's not all bad. It's not that agriculture's a bad thing.
p237
aVIn fact, we completely depend on it.
p238
aVIt's not optional. It's not a luxury. It's an absolute necessity.
p239
aVWe have to provide food and feed and, yeah,
p240
aVfiber and even biofuels to something like seven billion people
p241
aVin the world today, and if anything,
p242
aVwe're going to have the demands on agriculture
p243
aVincrease into the future. It's not going to go away.
p244
aVIt's going to get a lot bigger, mainly because of
p245
aVgrowing population. We're seven billion people today
p246
aVheading towards at least nine,
p247
aVprobably nine and a half before we're done.
p248
aVMore importantly, changing diets.
p249
aVAs the world becomes wealthier as well as more populous,
p250
aVwe're seeing increases in dietary consumption of meat,
p251
aVwhich take a lot more resources than a vegetarian diet does.
p252
aVSo more people, eating more stuff, and richer stuff,
p253
aVand of course having an energy crisis at the same time,
p254
aVwhere we have to replace oil with other energy sources
p255
aVthat will ultimately have to include some kinds of biofuels
p256
aVand bio-energy sources.
p257
aVSo you put these together. It's really hard to see
p258
aVhow we're going to get to the rest of the century
p259
aVwithout at least doubling global agricultural production.
p260
aa(lp261
VWell, how are we going to do this? How are going to
p262
aVdouble global ag production around the world?
p263
aa(lp264
VWell, we could try to farm more land.
p265
aVThis is an analysis we've done, where on the left is where
p266
aVthe crops are today, on the right is where they could be
p267
aVbased on soils and climate, assuming climate change
p268
aVdoesn't disrupt too much of this,
p269
aVwhich is not a good assumption.
p270
aVWe could farm more land, but the problem is
p271
aVthe remaining lands are in sensitive areas.
p272
aVThey have a lot of biodiversity, a lot of carbon,
p273
aVthings we want to protect.
p274
aVSo we could grow more food by expanding farmland,
p275
aVbut we'd better not,
p276
aVbecause it's ecologically a very, very dangerous thing to do.
p277
aa(lp278
VInstead, we maybe want to freeze the footprint
p279
aVof agriculture and farm the lands we have better.
p280
aVThis is work that we're doing to try to highlight places
p281
aVin the world where we could improve yields
p282
aVwithout harming the environment.
p283
aVThe green areas here show where corn yields,
p284
aVjust showing corn as an example,
p285
aVare already really high, probably the maximum you could
p286
aVfind on Earth today for that climate and soil,
p287
aVbut the brown areas and yellow areas are places where
p288
aVwe're only getting maybe 20 or 30 percent of the yield
p289
aVyou should be able to get.
p290
aVYou see a lot of this in Africa, even Latin America,
p291
aVbut interestingly, Eastern Europe, where Soviet Union
p292
aVand Eastern Bloc countries used to be,
p293
aVis still a mess agriculturally.
p294
aVNow, this would require nutrients and water.
p295
aVIt's going to either be organic or conventional
p296
aVor some mix of the two to deliver that.
p297
aVPlants need water and nutrients.
p298
aVBut we can do this, and there are opportunities to make this work.
p299
aa(lp300
VBut we have to do it in a way that is sensitive
p301
aVto meeting the food security needs of the future
p302
aVand the environmental security needs of the future.
p303
aVWe have to figure out how to make this tradeoff between
p304
aVgrowing food and having a healthy environment work better.
p305
aa(lp306
VRight now, it's kind of an all-or-nothing proposition.
p307
aVWe can grow food in the background \u2014
p308
aVthat's a soybean field \u2014
p309
aVand in this flower diagram, it shows we grow a lot of food,
p310
aVbut we don't have a lot clean water, we're not storing
p311
aVa lot of carbon, we don't have a lot of biodiversity.
p312
aVIn the foreground, we have this prairie
p313
aVthat's wonderful from the environmental side,
p314
aVbut you can't eat anything. What's there to eat?
p315
aVWe need to figure out how to bring both of those together
p316
aVinto a new kind of agriculture that brings them all together.
p317
aa(lp318
VNow, when I talk about this, people often tell me,
p319
aV"Well, isn't blank the answer?" \u2014 organic food,
p320
aVlocal food, GMOs, new trade subsidies, new farm bills \u2014
p321
aVand yeah, we have a lot of good ideas here,
p322
aVbut not any one of these is a silver bullet.
p323
aVIn fact, what I think they are is more like silver buckshot.
p324
aVAnd I love silver buckshot. You put it together
p325
aVand you've got something really powerful,
p326
aVbut we need to put them together.
p327
aa(lp328
VSo what we have to do, I think, is invent a new kind
p329
aVof agriculture that blends the best ideas
p330
aVof commercial agriculture and the green revolution
p331
aVwith the best ideas of organic farming and local food
p332
aVand the best ideas of environmental conservation,
p333
aVnot to have them fighting each other but to have them
p334
aVcollaborating together to form a new kind of agriculture,
p335
aVsomething I call "terraculture," or farming for a whole planet.
p336
aa(lp337
VNow, having this conversation has been really hard,
p338
aVand we've been trying very hard to bring these key points
p339
aVto people to reduce the controversy,
p340
aVto increase the collaboration.
p341
aVI want to show you a short video that does kind of show
p342
aVour efforts right now to bring these sides together
p343
aVinto a single conversation. So let me show you that.
p344
aV(Music)
p345
aV("Institute on the Environment, University of Minnesota: Driven to Discover")
p346
aV(Music)
p347
aV("The world population is growing
p348
aVby 75 million people each year.
p349
aVThat's almost the size of Germany.
p350
aVToday, we're nearing 7 billion people.
p351
aVAt this rate, we'll reach 9 billion people by 2040.
p352
aVAnd we all need food.
p353
aVBut how?
p354
aVHow do we feed a growing world without destroying the planet?
p355
aVWe already know climate change is a big problem.
p356
aVBut it's not the only problem.
p357
aVWe need to face 'the other inconvenient truth.'
p358
aVA global crisis in agriculture.
p359
aVPopulation growth + meat consumption + dairy consumption + energy costs + bioenergy production = stress on natural resources.
p360
aVMore than 40% of Earth's land has been cleared for agriculture.
p361
aVGlobal croplands cover 16 million km².
p362
aVThat's almost the size of South America.
p363
aVGlobal pastures cover 30 million km².
p364
aVThat's the size of Africa.
p365
aVAgriculture uses 60 times more land than urban and suburban areas combined.
p366
aVIrrigation is the biggest use of water on the planet.
p367
aVWe use 2,800 cubic kilometers of water on crops every year.
p368
aVThat's enough to fill 7,305 Empire State Buildings every day.
p369
aVToday, many large rivers have reduced flows.
p370
aVSome dry up altogether.
p371
aVLook at the Aral Sea, now turned to desert.
p372
aVOr the Colorado River, which no longer flows to the ocean.
p373
aVFertilizers have more than doubled the phosphorus and nitrogen in the environment.
p374
aVThe consequence?
p375
aVWidespread water pollution
p376
aVand massive degradation of lakes and rivers.
p377
aVSurprisingly, agriculture is the biggest contributor to climate change.
p378
aVIt generates 30% of greenhouse gas emissions.
p379
aVThat's more than the emissions from all electricity and industry,
p380
aVor from all the world's planes, trains and automobiles.
p381
aVMost agricultural emissions come from tropical deforestation,
p382
aVmethane from animals and rice fields,
p383
aVand nitrous oxide from over-fertilizing.
p384
aVThere is nothing we do that transforms the world more than agriculture.
p385
aVAnd there's nothing we do that is more crucial to our survival.
p386
aVHere's the dilemma...
p387
aVAs the world grows by several billion more people,
p388
aVWe'll need to double, maybe even triple, global food production.
p389
aVSo where do we go from here?
p390
aVWe need a bigger conversation, an international dialogue.
p391
aVWe need to invest in real solutions:
p392
aVincentives for farmers, precision agriculture, new crop varieties, drip irrigation,
p393
aVgray water recycling, better tillage practices, smarter diets.
p394
aVWe need everyone at the table.
p395
aVAdvocates of commercial agriculture,
p396
aVenvironmental conservation,
p397
aVand organic farming...
p398
aVmust work together.
p399
aVThere is no single solution.
p400
aVWe need collaboration,
p401
aVimagination,
p402
aVdetermination,
p403
aVbecause failure is not an option.
p404
aVHow do we feed the world without destroying it?
p405
aVYeah, so we face one of the greatest grand challenges
p406
aVin all of human history today:
p407
aVthe need to feed nine billion people
p408
aVand do so sustainably and equitably and justly,
p409
aVat the same time protecting our planet
p410
aVfor this and future generations.
p411
aVThis is going to be one of the hardest things
p412
aVwe ever have done in human history,
p413
aVand we absolutely have to get it right,
p414
aVand we have to get it right on our first and only try.
p415
aVSo thanks very much. (Applause)

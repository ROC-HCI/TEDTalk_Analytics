VOne in four people suffer from some sort of mental illness,
p5
aVso if it was one, two, three, four, it's you, sir.
p6
aVYou. Yeah. (Laughter)
p7
aVWith the weird teeth. And you next to him. (Laughter)
p8
aVYou know who you are.
p9
aVActually, that whole row isn't right. (Laughter)
p10
aVThat's not good. Hi. Yeah. Real bad. Don't even look at me. (Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VI am one of the one in four. Thank you.
p13
aVI think I inherit it from my mother, who,
p14
aVused to crawl around the house on all fours.
p15
aVShe had two sponges in her hand, and then she had two
p16
aVtied to her knees. My mother was completely absorbent. (Laughter)
p17
aVAnd she would crawl around behind me going,
p18
aV"Who brings footprints into a building?!"
p19
aVSo that was kind of a clue that things weren't right.
p20
aVSo before I start, I would like to thank
p21
aVthe makers of Lamotrigine, Sertraline, and Reboxetine,
p22
aVbecause without those few simple chemicals, I would not be vertical today.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo how did it start?
p25
aVMy mental illness \u2014 well, I'm not even going to talk about my mental illness.
p26
aVWhat am I going to talk about? Okay.
p27
aVI always dreamt that, when I had my final breakdown,
p28
aVit would be because I had a deep Kafkaesque
p29
aVexistentialist revelation,
p30
aVor that maybe Cate Blanchett would play me and she would win an Oscar for it. (Laughter)
p31
aVBut that's not what happened. I had my breakdown
p32
aVduring my daughter's sports day.
p33
aVThere were all the parents sitting in a parking lot
p34
aVeating food out of the back of their car \u2014 only the English \u2014
p35
aVeating their sausages. They loved their sausages. (Laughter)
p36
aVLord and Lady Rigor Mortis were nibbling on the tarmac,
p37
aVand then the gun went off and all the girlies started running,
p38
aVand all the mummies went, "Run! Run Chlamydia! Run!" (Laughter)
p39
aV"Run like the wind, Veruca! Run!"
p40
aVAnd all the girlies, girlies running, running, running,
p41
aVeverybody except for my daughter, who was just standing
p42
aVat the starting line, just waving,
p43
aVbecause she didn't know she was supposed to run.
p44
aVSo I took to my bed for about a month, and when I woke up
p45
aVI found I was institutionalized, and when I saw the other inmates,
p46
aVI realized that I had found my people, my tribe. (Laughter)
p47
aVBecause they became my only friends, they became my friends,
p48
aVbecause very few people that I knew \u2014 Well, I wasn't
p49
aVsent a lot of cards or flowers. I mean, if I had had a broken leg
p50
aVor I was with child I would have been inundated,
p51
aVbut all I got was a couple phone calls telling me to perk up.
p52
aVPerk up.
p53
aVBecause I didn't think of that. (Laughter)
p54
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p55
aa(lp56
VBecause, you know, the one thing, one thing that you get with this disease,
p57
aVthis one comes with a package, is you get a real sense of shame,
p58
aVbecause your friends go, "Oh come on, show me the lump,
p59
aVshow me the x-rays," and of course you've got nothing to show,
p60
aVso you're, like, really disgusted with yourself because you're thinking,
p61
aV"I'm not being carpet-bombed. I don't live in a township."
p62
aVSo you start to hear these abusive voices, but you don't hear one abusive voice,
p63
aVyou hear about a thousand \u2014 100,000 abusive voices,
p64
aVlike if the Devil had Tourette's, that's what it would sound like.
p65
aVBut we all know in here, you know, there is no Devil,
p66
aVthere are no voices in your head.
p67
aVYou know that when you have those abusive voices,
p68
aVall those little neurons get together and in that little gap
p69
aVyou get a real toxic "I want to kill myself" kind of chemical,
p70
aVand if you have that over and over again on a loop tape,
p71
aVyou might have yourself depression.
p72
aVOh, and that's not even the tip of the iceberg.
p73
aVIf you get a little baby, and you abuse it verbally,
p74
aVits little brain sends out chemicals that are so destructive
p75
aVthat the little part of its brain that can tell good from bad just doesn't grow,
p76
aVso you might have yourself a homegrown psychotic.
p77
aVIf a soldier sees his friend blown up, his brain goes into
p78
aVsuch high alarm that he can't actually put the experience into words,
p79
aVso he just feels the horror over and over again.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo here's my question. My question is, how come
p82
aVwhen people have mental damage, it's always an active imagination?
p83
aVHow come every other organ in your body can get sick
p84
aVand you get sympathy, except the brain?
p85
aa(lp86
VI'd like to talk a little bit more about the brain,
p87
aVbecause I know you like that here at TED,
p88
aVso if you just give me a minute here, okay.
p89
aVOkay, let me just say, there's some good news.
p90
aVThere is some good news. First of all, let me say,
p91
aVwe've come a long, long way.
p92
aVWe started off as a teeny, teeny little one-celled amoeba,
p93
aVtiny, just sticking onto a rock, and now, voila, the brain.
p94
aVHere we go. (Laughter)
p95
aVThis little baby has a lot of horsepower.
p96
aVIt comes completely conscious. It's got state-of-the-art lobes.
p97
aVWe've got the occipital lobe so we can actually see the world.
p98
aVWe got the temporal lobe so we can actually hear the world.
p99
aVHere we've got a little bit of long-term memory,
p100
aVso, you know that night you want to forget, when you got really drunk? Bye-bye! Gone. (Laughter)
p101
aVSo actually, it's filled with 100 billion neurons
p102
aVjust zizzing away, electrically transmitting information,
p103
aVzizzing, zizzing. I'm going to give you a little side view here.
p104
aVI don't know if you can get that here. (Laughter)
p105
aVSo, zizzing away, and so \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p106
aVAnd for every one \u2014 I know, I drew this myself. Thank you.
p107
aVFor every one single neuron, you can actually have
p108
aVfrom 10,000 to 100,000 different connections
p109
aVor dendrites or whatever you want to call it, and every time
p110
aVyou learn something, or you have an experience,
p111
aVthat bush grows, you know, that bush of information.
p112
aVCan you imagine, every human being is carrying
p113
aVthat equipment, even Paris Hilton? (Laughter)
p114
aVGo figure.
p115
aa(lp116
VBut I got a little bad news for you folks. I got some bad news.
p117
aVThis isn't for the one in four. This is for the four in four.
p118
aVWe are not equipped for the 21st century.
p119
aVEvolution did not prepare us for this. We just don't have the bandwidth,
p120
aVand for people who say, oh, they're having a nice day,
p121
aVthey're perfectly fine, they're more insane than the rest of us.
p122
aVBecause I'll show you where there might be a few glitches
p123
aVin evolution. Okay, let me just explain this to you.
p124
aVWhen we were ancient man \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p125
aVmillions of years ago, and we suddenly felt threatened
p126
aVby a predator, okay? \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p127
aVwe would \u2014 Thank you. I drew these myself. (Laughter)
p128
aVThank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
p129
aVThank you. Anyway, we would fill up with our own adrenaline
p130
aVand our own cortisol, and then we'd kill or be killed,
p131
aVwe'd eat or we'd be eaten, and then suddenly we'd de-fuel,
p132
aVand we'd go back to normal. Okay.
p133
aVSo the problem is, nowadays, with modern man\u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p134
aVwhen we feel in danger, we still fill up with our own chemical
p135
aVbut because we can't kill traffic wardens \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p136
aVor eat estate agents, the fuel just stays in our body
p137
aVover and over, so we're in a constant state of alarm,
p138
aVa constant state. And here's another thing that happened.
p139
aVAbout 150,000 years ago, when language came online,
p140
aVwe started to put words to this constant emergency,
p141
aVso it wasn't just, "Oh my God, there's a saber-toothed tiger,"
p142
aVwhich could be, it was suddenly, "Oh my God, I didn't send the email. Oh my God, my thighs are too fat.
p143
aVOh my God, everybody can see I'm stupid. I didn't get invited to the Christmas party!"
p144
aVSo you've got this nagging loop tape that goes
p145
aVover and over again that drives you insane, so,
p146
aVyou see what the problem is? What once made you safe
p147
aVnow drives you insane.
p148
aVI'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but somebody has to be.
p149
aVYour pets are happier than you are. (Laughter)
p150
aV(Applause)
p151
aVSo kitty cat, meow, happy happy happy, human beings, screwed. (Laughter)
p152
aVCompletely and utterly \u2014 so, screwed.
p153
aa(lp154
VBut my point is, if we don't talk about this stuff,
p155
aVand we don't learn how to deal with our lives, it's not going
p156
aVto be one in four. It's going to be four in four
p157
aVwho are really, really going to get ill in the upstairs department.
p158
aVAnd while we're at it, can we please stop the stigma?
p159
aVThank you. (Applause)
p160
aV(Applause) Thank you.

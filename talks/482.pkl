VI was speaking to a group of about 300 kids,
p5
aVages six to eight, at a children's museum,
p6
aVand I brought with me a bag full of legs,
p7
aVsimilar to the kinds of things you see up here,
p8
aVand had them laid out on a table for the kids.
p9
aVAnd, from my experience, you know, kids are naturally curious
p10
aVabout what they don't know, or don't understand,
p11
aVor is foreign to them.
p12
aVThey only learn to be frightened of those differences
p13
aVwhen an adult influences them to behave that way,
p14
aVand maybe censors that natural curiosity,
p15
aVor you know, reins in the question-asking
p16
aVin the hopes of them being polite little kids.
p17
aVSo I just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby
p18
aVwith these unruly kids, saying, "Now, whatever you do,
p19
aVdon't stare at her legs."
p20
aa(lp21
VBut, of course, that's the point.
p22
aVThat's why I was there, I wanted to invite them to look and explore.
p23
aVSo I made a deal with the adults
p24
aVthat the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes
p25
aVon their own.
p26
aVThe doors open, the kids descend on this table of legs,
p27
aVand they are poking and prodding, and they're wiggling toes,
p28
aVand they're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg
p29
aVto see what happens with that.
p30
aVAnd I said, "Kids, really quickly \u2014
p31
aVI woke up this morning, I decided I wanted to be able to jump over a house \u2014
p32
aVnothing too big, two or three stories \u2014
p33
aVbut, if you could think of any animal, any superhero, any cartoon character,
p34
aVanything you can dream up right now,
p35
aVwhat kind of legs would you build me?"
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd immediately a voice shouted, "Kangaroo!"
p38
aV"No, no, no! Should be a frog!"
p39
aV"No. It should be Go Go Gadget!"
p40
aV"No, no, no! It should be the Incredibles."
p41
aVAnd other things that I don't \u2014 aren't familiar with.
p42
aVAnd then, one eight-year-old said,
p43
aV"Hey, why wouldn't you want to fly too?"
p44
aVAnd the whole room, including me, was like, "Yeah."
p45
aV(Laughter)
p46
aVAnd just like that, I went from being a woman
p47
aVthat these kids would have been trained to see as "disabled"
p48
aVto somebody that had potential that their bodies didn't have yet.
p49
aVSomebody that might even be super-abled.
p50
aVInteresting.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo some of you actually saw me at TED, 11 years ago.
p53
aVAnd there's been a lot of talk about how life-changing this conference is
p54
aVfor both speakers and attendees, and I am no exception.
p55
aVTED literally was the launch pad to the next decade of my life's exploration.
p56
aVAt the time, the legs I presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics.
p57
aVI had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs
p58
aVmodeled after the hind leg of a cheetah,
p59
aVwhich you may have seen on stage yesterday.
p60
aVAnd also these very life-like, intrinsically painted silicone legs.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo at the time, it was my opportunity to put a call out
p63
aVto innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community
p64
aVto come bring their talent to the science and to the art
p65
aVof building legs.
p66
aVSo that we can stop compartmentalizing form, function and aesthetic,
p67
aVand assigning them different values.
p68
aVWell, lucky for me, a lot of people answered that call.
p69
aVAnd the journey started, funny enough, with a TED conference attendee \u2014
p70
aVChee Pearlman, who hopefully is in the audience somewhere today.
p71
aVShe was the editor then of a magazine called ID,
p72
aVand she gave me a cover story.
p73
aa(lp74
VThis started an incredible journey.
p75
aVCurious encounters were happening to me at the time;
p76
aVI'd been accepting numerous invitations to speak
p77
aVon the design of the cheetah legs around the world.
p78
aVAnd people would come up to me after the conference, after my talk,
p79
aVmen and women.
p80
aVAnd the conversation would go something like this,
p81
aV"You know Aimee, you're very attractive.
p82
aVYou don't look disabled."
p83
aV(Laughter)
p84
aVI thought, "Well, that's amazing,
p85
aVbecause I don't feel disabled."
p86
aVAnd it really opened my eyes to this conversation
p87
aVthat could be explored, about beauty.
p88
aVWhat does a beautiful woman have to look like?
p89
aVWhat is a sexy body?
p90
aVAnd interestingly, from an identity standpoint,
p91
aVwhat does it mean to have a disability?
p92
aVI mean, people \u2014 Pamela Anderson has more prosthetic in her body than I do.
p93
aVNobody calls her disabled.
p94
aV(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VSo this magazine, through the hands of graphic designer Peter Saville,
p97
aVwent to fashion designer Alexander McQueen, and photographer Nick Knight,
p98
aVwho were also interested in exploring that conversation.
p99
aVSo, three months after TED I found myself on a plane
p100
aVto London, doing my first fashion shoot,
p101
aVwhich resulted in this cover \u2014
p102
aV"Fashion-able"?
p103
aVThree months after that, I did my first runway show for Alexander McQueen
p104
aVon a pair of hand-carved wooden legs made from solid ash.
p105
aVNobody knew \u2014 everyone thought they were wooden boots.
p106
aVActually, I have them on stage with me:
p107
aVgrapevines, magnolias \u2014 truly stunning.
p108
aVPoetry matters.
p109
aVPoetry is what elevates the banal and neglected object
p110
aVto a realm of art.
p111
aVIt can transform the thing that might have made people fearful
p112
aVinto something that invites them to look,
p113
aVand look a little longer,
p114
aVand maybe even understand.
p115
aa(lp116
VI learned this firsthand with my next adventure.
p117
aVThe artist Matthew Barney, in his film opus called the "The Cremaster Cycle."
p118
aVThis is where it really hit home for me \u2014
p119
aVthat my legs could be wearable sculpture.
p120
aVAnd even at this point, I started to move away from the need to replicate human-ness
p121
aVas the only aesthetic ideal.
p122
aVSo we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legs
p123
aVeven though they're actually optically clear polyurethane,
p124
aVa.k.a. bowling ball material.
p125
aVHeavy!
p126
aVThen we made these legs that are cast in soil
p127
aVwith a potato root system growing in them, and beetroots out the top,
p128
aVand a very lovely brass toe.
p129
aVThat's a good close-up of that one.
p130
aVThen another character was a half-woman, half-cheetah \u2014
p131
aVa little homage to my life as an athlete.
p132
aV14 hours of prosthetic make-up
p133
aVto get into a creature that had articulated paws,
p134
aVclaws and a tail that whipped around,
p135
aVlike a gecko.
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aVAnd then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these \u2014
p138
aVlook like jellyfish legs,
p139
aValso polyurethane.
p140
aVAnd the only purpose that these legs can serve,
p141
aVoutside the context of the film,
p142
aVis to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination.
p143
aVSo whimsy matters.
p144
aa(lp145
VToday, I have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs
p146
aVthat various people have made for me,
p147
aVand with them I have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet,
p148
aVand I can change my height \u2014
p149
aVI have a variable of five different heights.
p150
aV(Laughter)
p151
aVToday, I'm 6'1".
p152
aVAnd I had these legs made a little over a year ago
p153
aVat Dorset Orthopedic in England
p154
aVand when I brought them home to Manhattan,
p155
aVmy first night out on the town, I went to a very fancy party.
p156
aVAnd a girl was there who has known me for years
p157
aVat my normal 5'8".
p158
aVHer mouth dropped open when she saw me,
p159
aVand she went, "But you're so tall!"
p160
aVAnd I said, "I know. Isn't it fun?"
p161
aVI mean, it's a little bit like wearing stilts on stilts,
p162
aVbut I have an entirely new relationship to door jams
p163
aVthat I never expected I would ever have.
p164
aVAnd I was having fun with it.
p165
aVAnd she looked at me,
p166
aVand she said, "But, Aimee, that's not fair."
p167
aV(Laughter)
p168
aV(Applause)
p169
aVAnd the incredible thing was she really meant it.
p170
aVIt's not fair that you can change your height,
p171
aVas you want it.
p172
aa(lp173
VAnd that's when I knew \u2014
p174
aVthat's when I knew that the conversation with society
p175
aVhas changed profoundly
p176
aVin this last decade.
p177
aVIt is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency.
p178
aVIt's a conversation about augmentation.
p179
aVIt's a conversation about potential.
p180
aVA prosthetic limb doesn't represent the need to replace loss anymore.
p181
aVIt can stand as a symbol that the wearer
p182
aVhas the power to create whatever it is that they want to create
p183
aVin that space.
p184
aVSo people that society once considered to be disabled
p185
aVcan now become the architects of their own identities
p186
aVand indeed continue to change those identities
p187
aVby designing their bodies
p188
aVfrom a place of empowerment.
p189
aVAnd what is exciting to me so much right now
p190
aVis that by combining cutting-edge technology \u2014
p191
aVrobotics, bionics \u2014
p192
aVwith the age-old poetry,
p193
aVwe are moving closer to understanding our collective humanity.
p194
aVI think that if we want to discover the full potential
p195
aVin our humanity,
p196
aVwe need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths
p197
aVand those glorious disabilities that we all have.
p198
aVI think of Shakespeare's Shylock:
p199
aV"If you prick us, do we not bleed,
p200
aVand if you tickle us, do we not laugh?"
p201
aVIt is our humanity,
p202
aVand all the potential within it,
p203
aVthat makes us beautiful.
p204
aVThank you.
p205
aV(Applause)

(lp4
VI am going to talk about myself,
p5
aVwhich I rarely do, because I \u2014
p6
aVwell for one thing, I prefer to talk about things I know nothing about.
p7
aVAnd secondly, I'm a recovering narcissist.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aVI didn't know I was a narcissist actually.
p10
aVI thought narcissism meant you loved yourself.
p11
aVAnd then someone told me there is a flip side to it.
p12
aVSo it's actually drearier than self-love;
p13
aVit's unrequited self-love.
p14
aV(Laughter)
p15
aVI don't feel I can afford a relapse.
p16
aa(lp17
VBut I want to, though, explain
p18
aVhow I came to design my own particular brand of comedy
p19
aVbecause I've been through so many different forms of it.
p20
aVI started with improvisation,
p21
aVin a particular form of improvisation called theater games,
p22
aVwhich had one rule,
p23
aVwhich I always thought was a great rule for an ethic for a society.
p24
aVAnd the rule was, you couldn't deny the other person's reality,
p25
aVyou could only build on it.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd of course we live in a society that's all about
p28
aVcontradicting other peoples' reality.
p29
aVIt's all about contradiction,
p30
aVwhich I think is why I'm so sensitive to contradiction in general.
p31
aVI see it everywhere.
p32
aVLike polls. You know, it's always curious to me
p33
aVthat in public opinion polls
p34
aVthe percentage of Americans who don't know the answer to any given question
p35
aVis always two percent.
p36
aV75 percent of Americans
p37
aVthink Alaska is part of Canada.
p38
aVBut only two percent don't know the effect
p39
aVthat the debacle in Argentina will have on the IMF's monetary policy \u2014
p40
aV(Laughter)
p41
aVseems a contradiction.
p42
aVOr this ad that I read in the New York Times:
p43
aV"Wearing a fine watch speaks loudly of your rank in society.
p44
aVBuying it from us screams good taste."
p45
aV(Laughter)
p46
aVOr this that I found in a magazine called California Lawyer,
p47
aVin an article that is surely meant for the lawyers at Enron.
p48
aV"Surviving the Slammer: Do's and Don'ts."
p49
aV(Laughter)
p50
aV"Don't use big words."
p51
aV(Laughter)
p52
aV"Learn the lingua franca."
p53
aV(Laughter)
p54
aVYeah. "Lingua this, Frankie."
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd I suppose it's a contradiction that I
p59
aVtalk about science when I don't know math.
p60
aVYou know, because \u2014 and by the way to I was so grateful to Dean Kamen
p61
aVfor pointing out that one of the reasons,
p62
aVthat there are cultural reasons
p63
aVthat women and minorities don't enter the fields of science and technology \u2014
p64
aVbecause for instance, the reason I don't do math is,
p65
aVI was taught to do math and read at the same time.
p66
aVSo you're six years old, you're reading Snow White and the Seven Dwarves,
p67
aVand it becomes rapidly obvious
p68
aVthat there are only two kinds of men in the world:
p69
aVdwarves and Prince Charmings.
p70
aVAnd the odds are seven to one against your finding the prince.
p71
aV(Laughter)
p72
aVThat's why little girls don't do math. It's too depressing.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VOf course, by talking about science
p77
aVI also may, as I did the other night,
p78
aVincur the violent wrath of some scientists
p79
aVwho were very upset with me.
p80
aVI used the word postmodern as if it were OK.
p81
aVAnd they got very upset.
p82
aVOne of them, to his credit, I think really just wanted to engage me
p83
aVin a serious argument.
p84
aVBut I don't engage in serious arguments.
p85
aVI don't approve of them
p86
aVbecause arguments, of course, are all about contradiction,
p87
aVand they're shaped by the values that I have questions with.
p88
aa(lp89
VI have questions with the values of Newtonian science,
p90
aVlike rationality. You're supposed to be rational in an argument.
p91
aVWell rationality is constructed
p92
aVby what Christie Hefner was talking about today,
p93
aVthat mind-body split, you know?
p94
aVThe head is good, body bad.
p95
aVHead is ego, body id.
p96
aVWhen we say "I," \u2014 as when Rene Descartes said,
p97
aV"I think therefore I am," \u2014
p98
aVwe mean the head.
p99
aVAnd as David Lee Roth sang in "Just a Gigolo,"
p100
aV"I ain't got no body."
p101
aVThat's how you get rationality.
p102
aVAnd that's why so much of humor
p103
aVis the body asserting itself against the head.
p104
aVThat's why you have toilet humor and sexual humor.
p105
aVThat's why you have the Raspyni Brothers
p106
aVwhacking Richard in the genital area.
p107
aVAnd we're laughing doubly then
p108
aVbecause he's the body, but it's also \u2014
p109
aa(lp110
VVoice offstage: Richard.
p111
aa(lp112
VEmily Levine: Richard. What did I say?
p113
aV(Laughter)
p114
aVRichard. Yes but it's also the head,
p115
aVthe head of the conference.
p116
aa(lp117
VThat's the other way that humor \u2014
p118
aVlike Art Buchwald takes shots at the heads of state.
p119
aVIt doesn't make quite as much money as body humor I'm sure \u2014
p120
aV(Laughter)
p121
aVbut nevertheless, what makes us treasure you and adore you.
p122
aa(lp123
VThere's also a contradiction in rationality in this country though,
p124
aVwhich is, as much as we revere the head,
p125
aVwe are very anti-intellectual.
p126
aVI know this because I read in the New York Times,
p127
aVthe Ayn Rand foundation took out a full-page ad
p128
aVafter September 11,
p129
aVin which they said, "The problem is not Iraq or Iran,
p130
aVthe problem in this country, facing this country
p131
aVis the university professors and their spawn."
p132
aV(Laughter)
p133
aVSo I went back and re-read "The Fountainhead."
p134
aV(Laughter)
p135
aVI don't know how many of you have read it.
p136
aVAnd I'm not an expert on sadomasochism.
p137
aV(Laughter)
p138
aVBut let me just read you a couple of random passages from page 217.
p139
aa(lp140
V"The act of a master
p141
aVtaking painful contemptuous possession of her,
p142
aVwas the kind of rapture she wanted.
p143
aVWhen they lay together in bed it was,
p144
aVas it had to be, as the nature of the act demanded,
p145
aVan act of violence.
p146
aVIt was an act of clenched teeth and hatred. It was the unendurable.
p147
aVNot a caress, but a wave of pain.
p148
aVThe agony as an act of passion."
p149
aa(lp150
VSo you can imagine my surprise
p151
aVon reading in The New Yorker
p152
aVthat Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve,
p153
aVclaims Ayn Rand as his intellectual mentor.
p154
aV(Laughter)
p155
aVIt's like finding out your nanny is a dominatrix.
p156
aV(Laughter)
p157
aVBad enough we had to see J. Edgar Hoover in a dress.
p158
aVNow we have to picture Alan Greenspan
p159
aVin a black leather corset, with a butt tattoo that says,
p160
aV"Whip inflation now."
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd Ayn Rand of course, Ayn Rand
p165
aVis famous for a philosophy called Objectivism,
p166
aVwhich reflects another value of Newtonian physics,
p167
aVwhich is objectivity.
p168
aVObjectivity basically is constructed
p169
aVin that same S&M way.
p170
aVIt's the subject subjugating the object.
p171
aVThat's how you assert yourself.
p172
aVYou make yourself the active voice.
p173
aVAnd the object is the passive no-voice.
p174
aa(lp175
VI was so fascinated by that Oxygen commercial.
p176
aVI don't know if you know this but \u2014
p177
aVmaybe it's different now, or maybe you were making a statement \u2014
p178
aVbut in many hospital nurseries across the country,
p179
aVuntil very recently anyway, according to a book by Jessica Benjamin,
p180
aVthe signs over the little boys cribs read,
p181
aV"I'm a boy,"
p182
aVand the signs over the little girls cribs read,
p183
aV"It's a girl." Yeah.
p184
aVSo the passivity was culturally
p185
aVprojected onto the little girls.
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd this still goes on as I think I told you last year.
p188
aVThere's a poll that proves \u2014
p189
aVthere was a poll that was given by Time magazine,
p190
aVin which only men were asked, "Have you ever had sex
p191
aVwith a woman you actively disliked?"
p192
aVAnd well, yeah.
p193
aVWell, 58 percent said yes,
p194
aVwhich I think is overinflated though
p195
aVbecause so many men if you just say,
p196
aV"Have you ever had sex ... " "Yes!"
p197
aVThey don't even wait for the rest of it.
p198
aV(Laughter)
p199
aVAnd of course two percent did not know whether they'd had \u2014
p200
aV(Laughter)
p201
aVThat's the first callback,
p202
aVof my attempted quadruple.
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VSo this subject-object thing,
p207
aVis part of something I'm very interested in
p208
aVbecause this is why, frankly, I believe in political correctness.
p209
aVI do. I think it can go too far.
p210
aVI think Ringling Brothers may have gone too far
p211
aVwith an ad they took out in the New York Times Magazine.
p212
aV"We have a lifelong emotional and financial
p213
aVcommitment to our Asian Elephant partners."
p214
aV(Laughter)
p215
aVMaybe too far. But you know \u2014
p216
aVI don't think that
p217
aVa person of color making fun of white people
p218
aVis the same thing as a white person making fun of people of color.
p219
aVOr women making fun of men is the same as men making fun of women.
p220
aVOr poor people making fun of rich people, the same as rich people.
p221
aa(lp222
VI think you can make fun of the have but not the have-nots,
p223
aVwhich is why you don't see me making fun of
p224
aVKenneth Lay and his charming wife.
p225
aV(Laughter)
p226
aVWhat's funny about being down to four houses?
p227
aV(Laughter)
p228
aVAnd I really learned this lesson
p229
aVduring the sex scandals of the Clinton administration or,
p230
aVOr as I call them, the good ol' days.
p231
aV(Laughter)
p232
aVWhen people I knew, you know, people who considered themselves liberal,
p233
aVand everything else,
p234
aVwere making fun of Jennifer Flowers and Paula Jones.
p235
aVBasically, they were making fun of them for being
p236
aVtrailer trash or white trash.
p237
aVIt seems, I suppose, a harmless prejudice
p238
aVand that you're not really hurting anybody.
p239
aVUntil you read, as I did, an ad in the Los Angeles Times.
p240
aV"For sale: White trash compactor."
p241
aV(Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
VSo this whole subject-object thing
p244
aVhas relevance to humor in this way.
p245
aVI read a book by a woman named Amy Richlin,
p246
aVwho is the chair of the Classics department at USC.
p247
aVAnd the book is called "The Garden of Priapus."
p248
aVAnd she says that Roman humor
p249
aVmirrors the construction of Roman society.
p250
aVSo that Roman society was very top/bottom,
p251
aVas ours is to some degree.
p252
aVAnd so was humor.
p253
aVThere always had to be the butt of a joke.
p254
aVSo it was always the satirist,
p255
aVlike Juvenal or Martial,
p256
aVrepresented the audience,
p257
aVand he was going to make fun of the outsider,
p258
aVthe person who didn't share that subject status.
p259
aa(lp260
VAnd in stand-up of course,
p261
aVthe stand-up comedian is supposed to dominate the audience.
p262
aVA lot of heckling is the tension
p263
aVof trying to make sure that the
p264
aVcomedian is going to be able to dominate,
p265
aVand overcome the heckler.
p266
aVAnd I got good at that when I was in stand up.
p267
aVBut I always hated it because they were
p268
aVdictating the terms of the interaction,
p269
aVin the same way that engaging in a serious argument
p270
aVdetermines the content, to some degree,
p271
aVof what you're talking about.
p272
aVAnd I was looking for a form
p273
aVthat didn't have that.
p274
aVAnd so I wanted something that was more interactive.
p275
aVI know that word is so debased now
p276
aVby the use of it by Internet marketers.
p277
aa(lp278
VI really miss the old telemarketers now, I'll tell you that.
p279
aV(Laughter)
p280
aVI do, because at least there you stood a chance. You know?
p281
aVI used to actually hang up on them.
p282
aVBut then I read in "Dear Abby" that that was rude.
p283
aVSo the next time that one called
p284
aVI let him get halfway through his spiel and then I said,
p285
aV"You sound sexy."
p286
aV(Laughter)
p287
aVHe hung up on me!
p288
aa(lp289
V(Laughter)
p290
aa(lp291
VBut the interactivity allows the audience
p292
aVto shape what you're going to do as much as
p293
aVyou shape their experience of the world.
p294
aVAnd that's really what I'm looking for.
p295
aVAnd I was sort of, as I was starting to analyze
p296
aVwhat exactly it is that I do,
p297
aVI read a book called "Trickster Makes This World," by Lewis Hyde.
p298
aVAnd it was like being psychoanalyzed.
p299
aVI mean he had laid it all out.
p300
aVAnd then coming to this conference,
p301
aVI realized that most everybody here
p302
aVshared those same qualities
p303
aVbecause really what trickster is
p304
aVis an agent of change.
p305
aVTrickster is a change agent.
p306
aVAnd the qualities that I'm about to describe
p307
aVare the qualities that make it possible
p308
aVto make change happen.
p309
aVAnd one of these is boundary crossing.
p310
aVI think this is what so, in fact, infuriated the scientists.
p311
aVBut I like to cross boundaries.
p312
aVI like to, as I said, talk about things I know nothing about.
p313
aa(lp314
V(Phone Ringing)
p315
aa(lp316
VI hope that's my agent,
p317
aVbecause you aren't paying me anything.
p318
aa(lp319
V(Laughter)
p320
aa(lp321
VAnd I think it's good to talk about things I know nothing about
p322
aVbecause I bring a fresh viewpoint to it, you know?
p323
aVI'm able to see the contradiction
p324
aVthat you may not be able to see.
p325
aVLike for instance a mime once \u2014
p326
aVor a meme as he called himself.
p327
aVHe was a very selfish meme.
p328
aVAnd he said that I had to show more respect
p329
aVbecause it took up to 18 years
p330
aVto learn how to do mime properly.
p331
aVAnd I said, "Well, that's how you know only stupid people go into it."
p332
aV(Laughter)
p333
aVIt only takes two years to learn how to talk.
p334
aa(lp335
V(Laughter)
p336
aa(lp337
V(Applause)
p338
aa(lp339
VAnd you know people, this is the problem with
p340
aVquote, objectivity, unquote.
p341
aVWhen you're only surrounded by people
p342
aVwho speak the same vocabulary as you,
p343
aVor share the same set of assumptions as you,
p344
aVyou start to think that that's reality.
p345
aVLike economists, you know, their definition of rational,
p346
aVthat we all act out of our own economic self-interest.
p347
aVWell, look at Michael Hawley,
p348
aVor look at Dean Kamen,
p349
aVor look at my grandmother.
p350
aa(lp351
VMy grandmother always acted in other people's interests,
p352
aVwhether they wanted her to or not.
p353
aV(Laughter)
p354
aVIf they had had an Olympics in martyrdom,
p355
aVmy grandmother would have lost on purpose.
p356
aV(Laughter)
p357
aV"No, you take the prize.
p358
aVYou're young. I'm old. Who's going to see it?
p359
aVWhere am I going? I'm going to die soon."
p360
aa(lp361
V(Laughter)
p362
aa(lp363
VSo that's one \u2014 this boundary crossing,
p364
aVthis go-between which \u2014
p365
aVFritz Lanting, is that his name,
p366
aVactually said that he was a go-between.
p367
aVThat's an actual quality of the trickster.
p368
aVAnd another is, non-oppositional strategies.
p369
aVAnd this is instead of contradiction.
p370
aVWhere you deny the other person's reality,
p371
aVyou have paradox
p372
aVwhere you allow more than one reality to coexist,
p373
aa(lp374
VI think there's another philosophical construction.
p375
aVI'm not sure what it's called.
p376
aVBut my example of it is a sign that I saw in a jewelry store.
p377
aVIt said, "Ears pierced while you wait."
p378
aV(Laughter)
p379
aVThere the alternative just boggles the imagination.
p380
aV(Laughter)
p381
aV"Oh no. Thanks though, I'll leave them here. Thanks very much.
p382
aVI have some errands to run. So I'll be back to pick them up
p383
aVaround five, if that's OK with you.
p384
aVHuh? Huh? What? Can't hear you."
p385
aa(lp386
V(Laughter)
p387
aa(lp388
VAnd another attribute of the trickster
p389
aVis smart luck.
p390
aVThat accidents, that Louis Kahn, who talked about accidents,
p391
aVthis is another quality of the trickster.
p392
aVThe trickster has a mind that is prepared for the unprepared.
p393
aVThat, and I will say this to the scientists,
p394
aVthat the trickster has the ability to hold
p395
aVhis ideas lightly
p396
aVso that he can let room in for new ideas
p397
aVor to see the contradictions or the hidden problems
p398
aVwith his ideas.
p399
aVI had no joke for that.
p400
aVI just wanted to put the scientists in their place.
p401
aV(Laughter)
p402
aa(lp403
VBut here's how I think I like to make change,
p404
aVand that is in making connections.
p405
aVThis is what I tend to see
p406
aValmost more than contradictions.
p407
aVLike the, what do you call those toes of the gecko?
p408
aVYou know, the toes of the gecko,
p409
aVcurling and uncurling like the fingers of Michael Moschen.
p410
aVI love connections.
p411
aa(lp412
VLike I'll read that one of the two attributes
p413
aVof matter in the Newtonian universe \u2014
p414
aVthere are two attributes of matter in the Newtonian universe \u2014
p415
aVone is space occupancy. Matter takes up space.
p416
aVI guess the more you matter the more space you take up,
p417
aVwhich explains the whole SUV phenomenon.
p418
aV(Laughter)
p419
aVAnd the other one though is impenetrability.
p420
aa(lp421
VWell, in ancient Rome, impenetrability
p422
aVwas the criterion of masculinity.
p423
aVMasculinity depended on you
p424
aVbeing the active penetrator.
p425
aVAnd then, in economics, there's an active producer
p426
aVand a passive consumer,
p427
aVwhich explains why business always has to
p428
aVpenetrate new markets.
p429
aVWell yeah, I mean why we forced China
p430
aVto open her markets.
p431
aVAnd didn't that feel good?
p432
aV(Laughter)
p433
aVAnd now we're being penetrated.
p434
aVYou know the biotech companies are actually going inside us
p435
aVand planting their little flags on our genes.
p436
aVYou know we're being penetrated.
p437
aVAnd I suspect, by someone who actively dislikes us.
p438
aV(Laughter)
p439
aVThat's the second of the quadruple.
p440
aVYes of course you got that. Thank you very much.
p441
aVI still have a way to go.
p442
aa(lp443
V(Laughter)
p444
aa(lp445
VAnd what I hope to do, when I make these connections,
p446
aVis short circuit people's thinking.
p447
aVYou know, make you not follow your usual
p448
aVtrain of association,
p449
aVbut make you rewire.
p450
aVIt literally \u2014 when people say about the shock of recognition,
p451
aVit's literally re-cognition, rewiring how you think \u2014
p452
aVI had a joke to go with this and I forgot it.
p453
aVI'm so sorry. I'm getting like
p454
aVthe woman in that joke about \u2014
p455
aa(lp456
Vhave you heard this joke about the woman driving with her mother?
p457
aVAnd the mother is elderly.
p458
aVAnd the mother goes right through a red light.
p459
aVAnd the daughter doesn't want to say anything.
p460
aVShe doesn't want to be like, "You're too old to drive."
p461
aVAnd the mother goes through a second red light.
p462
aVAnd the daughter says, as tactfully as possible,
p463
aV"Mom, are you aware that you just went through two red lights?"
p464
aVAnd the mother says, "Oh! Am I driving?"

VAnd that's the shock of recognition
p469
aVat the shock of recognition.
p470
aVThat completes the quadruple.
p471
aa(lp472
V(Laughter)
p473
aa(lp474
VI just want to say two more things.
p475
aVOne is, another characteristic of trickster
p476
aVis that the trickster has to
p477
aVwalk this fine line.
p478
aVHe has to have poise.
p479
aVAnd you know the biggest hurdle for me,
p480
aVin doing what I do,
p481
aVis constructing my performance
p482
aVso that it's prepared and unprepared.
p483
aVFinding the balance between those things
p484
aVis always dangerous
p485
aVbecause you might tip off too much in the direction of unprepared.
p486
aVBut being too prepared doesn't leave room
p487
aVfor the accidents to happen.
p488
aa(lp489
VI was thinking about what Moshe Safdie
p490
aVsaid yesterday about beauty
p491
aVbecause in his book, Hyde says that
p492
aVsometimes trickster can tip over into beauty.
p493
aVBut to do that you have to
p494
aVlose all the other qualities
p495
aVbecause once you're into beauty
p496
aVyou're into a finished thing.
p497
aVYou're into something that
p498
aVoccupies space and inhabits time.
p499
aVIt's an actual thing.
p500
aVAnd it is always extraordinary to see a thing of beauty.
p501
aVBut if you don't do that,
p502
aVif you allow for the accident to keep on happening,
p503
aVyou have the possibility of getting on a wavelength.
p504
aVI like to think of what I do as a probability wave.
p505
aVWhen you go into beauty the probability wave
p506
aVcollapses into one possibility.
p507
aVAnd I like to explore all the possibilities
p508
aVin the hope that you'll be on the wavelength of your audience.
p509
aa(lp510
VAnd the one final quality I want to say about trickster is
p511
aVthat he doesn't have a home.
p512
aVHe's always on the road.
p513
aVI want to say to you Richard, in closing,
p514
aVthat in TED you've created a home.
p515
aVAnd thank you for inviting me into it.
p516
aVThank you very much.

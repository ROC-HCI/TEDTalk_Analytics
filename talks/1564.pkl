VIt's time to start designing for our ears.
p5
aVArchitects and designers tend to focus
p6
aVexclusively on these.
p7
aVThey use these to design with and they design for them,
p8
aVwhich is why we end up sitting in restaurants that look
p9
aVlike this \u2014 (loud crowd noise) \u2014 and sound like this,
p10
aVshouting from a foot away to try and be heard
p11
aVby our dinner companion,
p12
aVor why we get on airplanes \u2014 (flight attendant announcements) \u2014 which cost 200 million pounds,
p13
aVwith somebody talking through an old-fashioned telephone handset
p14
aVon a cheap stereo system,
p15
aVmaking us jump out of our skins.
p16
aa(lp17
VWe're designing environments that make us crazy. (Laughter)
p18
aVAnd it's not just our quality of life which suffers.
p19
aVIt's our health,
p20
aVour social behavior, and our productivity as well.
p21
aa(lp22
VHow does this work? Well, two ways.
p23
aVFirst of all, ambience. I have a whole TEDTalk about this.
p24
aVSound affects us physiologically, psychologically,
p25
aVcognitively and behaviorally all the time.
p26
aVThe sound around us is affecting us
p27
aVeven though we're not conscious of it.
p28
aVThere's a second way though, as well.
p29
aVThat's interference. Communication requires sending
p30
aVand receiving, and I have another whole TEDTalk
p31
aVabout the importance of conscious listening,
p32
aVbut I can send as well as I like,
p33
aVand you can be brilliant conscious listeners.
p34
aVIf the space I'm sending it in is not effective,
p35
aVthat communication can't happen.
p36
aa(lp37
VSpaces tend to include noise and acoustics.
p38
aVA room like this has acoustics, this one very good acoustics.
p39
aVMany rooms are not so good.
p40
aVLet me give you some examples from a couple of areas
p41
aVwhich I think we all care about: health and education.
p42
aV(Hospital noises) When I was visiting my terminally ill father
p43
aVin a hospital, I was asking myself,
p44
aVhow does anybody get well in a place that sounds like this?
p45
aVHospital sound is getting worse all the time.
p46
aVNoise levels in hospitals have doubled
p47
aVin the last few years, and it affects not just the patients
p48
aVbut also the people working there.
p49
aVI think we would like for dispensing errors to be zero,
p50
aVwouldn't we? And yet, as noise levels go up, so do
p51
aVthe errors in dispensing made by the staff in hospitals.
p52
aVMost of all, though, it affects the patients,
p53
aVand that could be you, it could be me.
p54
aVSleep is absolutely crucial for recovery.
p55
aVIt's when we regenerate, when we rebuild ourselves,
p56
aVand with threatening noise like this going on,
p57
aVyour body, even if you are able to sleep, your body
p58
aVis telling you, "I'm under threat. This is dangerous."
p59
aVAnd the quality of sleep is degraded, and so is our recovery.
p60
aVThere are just huge benefits to come
p61
aVfrom designing for the ears in our health care.
p62
aVThis is an area I intend to take on this year.
p63
aa(lp64
VEducation.
p65
aVWhen I see a classroom that looks like this,
p66
aVcan you imagine how this sounds?
p67
aVI am forced to ask myself a question.
p68
aV("Do architects have ears?") (Laughter)
p69
aVNow, that's a little unfair. Some of my best friends
p70
aVare architects. (Laughter) And they definitely do have ears.
p71
aVBut I think sometimes they don't use them
p72
aVwhen they're designing buildings. Here's a case in point.
p73
aVThis is a 32-million-pound flagship academy school
p74
aVwhich was built quite recently in the U.K. and designed
p75
aVby one of Britain's top architects.
p76
aVUnfortunately, it was designed like a corporate
p77
aVheadquarters, with a vast central atrium
p78
aVand classrooms leading off it with no back walls at all.
p79
aVThe children couldn't hear their teachers.
p80
aVThey had to go back in and spend 600,000 pounds
p81
aVputting the walls in. Let's stop this madness
p82
aVof open plan classrooms right now, please.
p83
aa(lp84
VIt's not just these modern buildings which suffer.
p85
aVOld-fashioned classrooms suffer too.
p86
aVA study in Florida just a few years ago found
p87
aVthat if you're sitting where this photograph was taken
p88
aVin the classroom, row four, speech intelligibility
p89
aVis just 50 percent.
p90
aVChildren are losing one word in two.
p91
aVNow that doesn't mean they only get half their education,
p92
aVbut it does mean they have to work very hard
p93
aVto join the dots and understand what's going on.
p94
aa(lp95
VThis is affected massively by reverberation time,
p96
aVhow reverberant a room is.
p97
aVIn a classroom with a reverberation time of 1.2 seconds,
p98
aVwhich is pretty common, this is what it sounds like.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Inaudible echoing voice)
p101
aa(lp102
VNot so good, is it?
p103
aVIf you take that 1.2 seconds down to 0.4 seconds
p104
aVby installing acoustic treatments, sound absorbing materials
p105
aVand so forth, this is what you get.
p106
aa(lp107
VVoice: In language, infinitely many words can be written
p108
aVwith a small set of letters. In arithmetic,
p109
aVinfinitely many numbers can be composed
p110
aVfrom just a few digits with the help of the simple zero.
p111
aa(lp112
VJulian Treasure: What a difference.
p113
aVNow that education you would receive,
p114
aVand thanks to the British acoustician Adrian James
p115
aVfor those simulations. The signal was the same,
p116
aVthe background noise was the same.
p117
aVAll that changed was the acoustics of the classroom
p118
aVin those two examples.
p119
aa(lp120
VIf education can be likened to watering a garden,
p121
aVwhich is a fair metaphor, sadly, much of the water
p122
aVis evaporating before it reaches the flowers,
p123
aVespecially for some groups,
p124
aVfor example, those with hearing impairment.
p125
aVNow that's not just deaf children. That could be any child
p126
aVwho's got a cold, glue ear, an ear infection,
p127
aVeven hay fever. On a given day, one in eight children
p128
aVfall into that group, on any given day.
p129
aVThen you have children for whom English is a second language,
p130
aVor whatever they're being taught in is a second language.
p131
aVIn the U.K., that's more than 10 percent of the school population.
p132
aVAnd finally, after Susan Cain's wonderful TEDTalk in February,
p133
aVwe know that introverts find it very difficult to relate
p134
aVwhen they're in a noisy environment doing group work.
p135
aVAdd those up. That is a lot of children
p136
aVwho are not receiving their education properly.
p137
aa(lp138
VIt's not just the children who are affected, though.
p139
aV(Noisy conversation) This study in Germany found
p140
aVthe average noise level in classrooms is 65 decibels.
p141
aVI have to really raise my voice to talk over 65 decibels
p142
aVof sound, and teachers are not just raising their voices.
p143
aVThis chart maps the teacher's heart rate
p144
aVagainst the noise level.
p145
aVNoise goes up, heart rate goes up.
p146
aVThat is not good for you.
p147
aVIn fact, 65 decibels is the very level at which this big survey
p148
aVof all the evidence on noise and health found that, that is
p149
aVthe threshold for the danger of myocardial infarction.
p150
aVTo you and me, that's a heart attack.
p151
aVIt may not be pushing the boat out too far to suggest
p152
aVthat many teachers are losing significant life expectancy
p153
aVby teaching in environments like that day after day.
p154
aa(lp155
VWhat does it cost to treat a classroom
p156
aVdown to that 0.4-second reverberation time?
p157
aVTwo and a half thousand pounds.
p158
aVAnd the Essex study which has just been done in the U.K.,
p159
aVwhich incidentally showed that when you do this,
p160
aVyou do not just make a room that's suitable
p161
aVfor hearing-impaired children, you make a room
p162
aVwhere behavior improves, and results improve significantly,
p163
aVthis found that sending a child out of area to a school
p164
aVthat does have such a room, if you don't have one,
p165
aVcosts 90,000 pounds a year.
p166
aVI think the economics are pretty clear on this.
p167
aa(lp168
VI'm glad that debate is happening on this.
p169
aVI just moderated a major conference in London
p170
aVa few weeks ago called Sound Education,
p171
aVwhich brought together top acousticians,
p172
aVgovernment people, teachers, and so forth.
p173
aVWe're at last starting to debate this issue, and the benefits
p174
aVthat are available for designing for the ears in education,
p175
aVunbelievable.
p176
aVOut of that conference, incidentally, also came
p177
aVa free app which is designed to help children study
p178
aVif they're having to work at home, for example,
p179
aVin a noisy kitchen.
p180
aVAnd that's free out of that conference.
p181
aa(lp182
VLet's broaden the perspective a little bit
p183
aVand look at cities.
p184
aVWe have urban planners.
p185
aVWhere are the urban sound planners?
p186
aVI don't know of one in the world, and the opportunity is there
p187
aVto transform our experience in our cities.
p188
aVThe World Health Organization estimates
p189
aVthat a quarter of Europe's population is having its sleep
p190
aVdegraded by noise in cities. We can do better than that.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd in our offices, we spend a lot of time at work.
p193
aVWhere are the office sound planners?
p194
aVPeople who say, don't sit that team next to this team,
p195
aVbecause they like noise and they need quiet.
p196
aVOr who say, don't spend all your budget on a huge screen
p197
aVin the conference room,
p198
aVand then place one tiny microphone
p199
aVin the middle of a table for 30 people. (Laughter)
p200
aVIf you can hear me, you can understand me
p201
aVwithout seeing me. If you can see me without hearing me,
p202
aVthat does not work.
p203
aVSo office sound is a huge area, and incidentally,
p204
aVnoise in offices has been shown to make people
p205
aVless helpful, less enjoy their teamwork,
p206
aVand less productive at work.
p207
aa(lp208
VFinally, we have homes. We use interior designers.
p209
aVWhere are the interior sound designers?
p210
aVHey, let's all be interior sound designers,
p211
aVtake on listening to our rooms and designing sound
p212
aVthat's effective and appropriate.
p213
aa(lp214
VMy friend Richard Mazuch, an architect in London,
p215
aVcoined the phrase "invisible architecture."
p216
aVI love that phrase.
p217
aVIt's about designing, not appearance, but experience,
p218
aVso that we have spaces that sound as good as they look,
p219
aVthat are fit for purpose, that improve our quality of life,
p220
aVour health and well being, our social behavior
p221
aVand our productivity.
p222
aa(lp223
VIt's time to start designing for the ears.
p224
aVThank you. (Applause)
p225
aV(Applause)
p226
aVThank you. (Applause)

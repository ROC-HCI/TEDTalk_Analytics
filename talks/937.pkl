VIt feels like we're all suffering
p5
aVfrom information overload or data glut.
p6
aVAnd the good news is there might be an easy solution to that,
p7
aVand that's using our eyes more.
p8
aVSo, visualizing information, so that we can see
p9
aVthe patterns and connections that matter
p10
aVand then designing that information so it makes more sense,
p11
aVor it tells a story,
p12
aVor allows us to focus only on the information that's important.
p13
aVFailing that, visualized information can just look really cool.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo, let's see.
p16
aVThis is the $Billion Dollar o-Gram,
p17
aVand this image arose
p18
aVout of frustration I had
p19
aVwith the reporting of billion-dollar amounts in the press.
p20
aVThat is, they're meaningless without context:
p21
aV500 billion for this pipeline,
p22
aV20 billion for this war.
p23
aVIt doesn't make any sense, so the only way to understand it
p24
aVis visually and relatively.
p25
aVSo I scraped a load of reported figures
p26
aVfrom various news outlets
p27
aVand then scaled the boxes according to those amounts.
p28
aVAnd the colors here represent the motivation behind the money.
p29
aVSo purple is "fighting,"
p30
aVand red is "giving money away," and green is "profiteering."
p31
aVAnd what you can see straight away
p32
aVis you start to have a different relationship to the numbers.
p33
aVYou can literally see them.
p34
aVBut more importantly, you start to see
p35
aVpatterns and connections between numbers
p36
aVthat would otherwise be scattered across multiple news reports.
p37
aa(lp38
VLet me point out some that I really like.
p39
aVThis is OPEC's revenue, this green box here \u2014
p40
aV780 billion a year.
p41
aVAnd this little pixel in the corner \u2014 three billion \u2014
p42
aVthat's their climate change fund.
p43
aVAmericans, incredibly generous people \u2014
p44
aVover 300 billion a year, donated to charity every year,
p45
aVcompared with the amount of foreign aid
p46
aVgiven by the top 17 industrialized nations
p47
aVat 120 billion.
p48
aVThen of course,
p49
aVthe Iraq War, predicted to cost just 60 billion
p50
aVback in 2003.
p51
aVAnd it mushroomed slightly. Afghanistan and Iraq mushroomed now
p52
aVto 3,000 billion.
p53
aVSo now it's great
p54
aVbecause now we have this texture, and we can add numbers to it as well.
p55
aVSo we could say, well, a new figure comes out ... let's see African debt.
p56
aVHow much of this diagram do you think might be taken up
p57
aVby the debt that Africa owes to the West?
p58
aVLet's take a look.
p59
aVSo there it is:
p60
aV227 billion is what Africa owes.
p61
aVAnd the recent financial crisis,
p62
aVhow much of this diagram might that figure take up?
p63
aVWhat has that cost the world? Let's take a look at that.
p64
aVDooosh \u2014 Which I think is the appropriate sound effect
p65
aVfor that much money:
p66
aV11,900 billion.
p67
aVSo, by visualizing this information,
p68
aVwe turned it into a landscape
p69
aVthat you can explore with your eyes,
p70
aVa kind of map really, a sort of information map.
p71
aVAnd when you're lost in information,
p72
aVan information map is kind of useful.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo I want to show you another landscape now.
p75
aVWe need to imagine what a landscape
p76
aVof the world's fears might look like.
p77
aVLet's take a look.
p78
aVThis is Mountains Out of Molehills,
p79
aVa timeline of global media panic.
p80
aV(Laughter)
p81
aVSo, I'll label this for you in a second.
p82
aVBut the height here, I want to point out,
p83
aVis the intensity of certain fears
p84
aVas reported in the media.
p85
aVLet me point them out.
p86
aVSo this, swine flu \u2014 pink.
p87
aVBird flu.
p88
aVSARS \u2014 brownish here. Remember that one?
p89
aVThe millennium bug,
p90
aVterrible disaster.
p91
aVThese little green peaks
p92
aVare asteroid collisions.
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aVAnd in summer, here, killer wasps.
p95
aa(lp96
V(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
VSo these are what our fears look like
p99
aVover time in our media.
p100
aVBut what I love \u2014 and I'm a journalist \u2014
p101
aVand what I love is finding hidden patterns; I love being a data detective.
p102
aVAnd there's a very interesting and odd pattern hidden in this data
p103
aVthat you can only see when you visualize it.
p104
aVLet me highlight it for you.
p105
aVSee this line, this is a landscape for violent video games.
p106
aVAs you can see, there's a kind of odd, regular pattern in the data,
p107
aVtwin peaks every year.
p108
aVIf we look closer, we see those peaks occur
p109
aVat the same month every year.
p110
aVWhy?
p111
aVWell, November, Christmas video games come out,
p112
aVand there may well be an upsurge in the concern about their content.
p113
aVBut April isn't a particularly massive month
p114
aVfor video games.
p115
aVWhy April?
p116
aVWell, in April 1999 was the Columbine shooting,
p117
aVand since then, that fear
p118
aVhas been remembered by the media
p119
aVand echoes through the group mind gradually through the year.
p120
aVYou have retrospectives, anniversaries,
p121
aVcourt cases, even copy-cat shootings,
p122
aVall pushing that fear into the agenda.
p123
aVAnd there's another pattern here as well. Can you spot it?
p124
aVSee that gap there? There's a gap,
p125
aVand it affects all the other stories.
p126
aVWhy is there a gap there?
p127
aVYou see where it starts? September 2001,
p128
aVwhen we had something very real
p129
aVto be scared about.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo, I've been working as a data journalist for about a year,
p132
aVand I keep hearing a phrase
p133
aVall the time, which is this:
p134
aV"Data is the new oil."
p135
aVData is the kind of ubiquitous resource
p136
aVthat we can shape to provide new innovations and new insights,
p137
aVand it's all around us, and it can be mined very easily.
p138
aVIt's not a particularly great metaphor in these times,
p139
aVespecially if you live around the Gulf of Mexico,
p140
aVbut I would, perhaps, adapt this metaphor slightly,
p141
aVand I would say that data is the new soil.
p142
aVBecause for me, it feels like a fertile, creative medium.
p143
aVOver the years, online,
p144
aVwe've laid down
p145
aVa huge amount of information and data,
p146
aVand we irrigate it with networks and connectivity,
p147
aVand it's been worked and tilled by unpaid workers and governments.
p148
aVAnd, all right, I'm kind of milking the metaphor a little bit.
p149
aVBut it's a really fertile medium,
p150
aVand it feels like visualizations, infographics, data visualizations,
p151
aVthey feel like flowers blooming from this medium.
p152
aVBut if you look at it directly,
p153
aVit's just a lot of numbers and disconnected facts.
p154
aVBut if you start working with it and playing with it in a certain way,
p155
aVinteresting things can appear and different patterns can be revealed.
p156
aa(lp157
VLet me show you this.
p158
aVCan you guess what this data set is?
p159
aVWhat rises twice a year,
p160
aVonce in Easter
p161
aVand then two weeks before Christmas,
p162
aVhas a mini peak every Monday,
p163
aVand then flattens out over the summer?
p164
aVI'll take answers.
p165
aV(Audience: Chocolate.) David McCandless: Chocolate.
p166
aVYou might want to get some chocolate in.
p167
aVAny other guesses?
p168
aV(Audience: Shopping.) DM: Shopping.
p169
aVYeah, retail therapy might help.
p170
aV(Audience: Sick leave.)
p171
aVDM: Sick leave. Yeah, you'll definitely want to take some time off.
p172
aVShall we see?
p173
aa(lp174
V(Laughter)
p175
aa(lp176
V(Applause)
p177
aa(lp178
VSo, the information guru Lee Byron and myself,
p179
aVwe scraped 10,000 status Facebook updates
p180
aVfor the phrase "break-up" and "broken-up"
p181
aVand this is the pattern we found \u2014
p182
aVpeople clearing out for Spring Break,
p183
aV(Laughter)
p184
aVcoming out of very bad weekends on a Monday,
p185
aVbeing single over the summer,
p186
aVand then the lowest day of the year, of course: Christmas Day.
p187
aVWho would do that?
p188
aVSo there's a titanic amount of data out there now,
p189
aVunprecedented.
p190
aVBut if you ask the right kind of question,
p191
aVor you work it in the right kind of way,
p192
aVinteresting things can emerge.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo information is beautiful. Data is beautiful.
p195
aVI wonder if I could make my life beautiful.
p196
aVAnd here's my visual C.V.
p197
aVI'm not quite sure I've succeeded.
p198
aVPretty blocky, the colors aren't that great.
p199
aVBut I wanted to convey something to you.
p200
aVI started as a programmer,
p201
aVand then I worked as a writer for many years, about 20 years,
p202
aVin print, online and then in advertising,
p203
aVand only recently have I started designing.
p204
aVAnd I've never been to design school.
p205
aVI've never studied art or anything.
p206
aVI just kind of learned through doing.
p207
aVAnd when I started designing,
p208
aVI discovered an odd thing about myself.
p209
aVI already knew how to design,
p210
aVbut it wasn't like I was amazingly brilliant at it,
p211
aVbut more like I was sensitive
p212
aVto the ideas of grids and space
p213
aVand alignment and typography.
p214
aVIt's almost like being exposed
p215
aVto all this media over the years
p216
aVhad instilled a kind of dormant design literacy in me.
p217
aVAnd I don't feel like I'm unique.
p218
aa(lp219
VI feel that everyday, all of us now
p220
aVare being blasted by information design.
p221
aVIt's being poured into our eyes through the Web,
p222
aVand we're all visualizers now;
p223
aVwe're all demanding a visual aspect
p224
aVto our information.
p225
aVThere's something almost quite magical about visual information.
p226
aVIt's effortless, it literally pours in.
p227
aVAnd if you're navigating a dense information jungle,
p228
aVcoming across a beautiful graphic
p229
aVor a lovely data visualization,
p230
aVit's a relief, it's like coming across a clearing in the jungle.
p231
aVI was curious about this, so it led me
p232
aVto the work of a Danish physicist
p233
aVcalled Tor Norretranders,
p234
aVand he converted the bandwidth of the senses into computer terms.
p235
aa(lp236
VSo here we go. This is your senses,
p237
aVpouring into your senses every second.
p238
aVYour sense of sight is the fastest.
p239
aVIt has the same bandwidth as a computer network.
p240
aVThen you have touch, which is about the speed of a USB key.
p241
aVAnd then you have hearing and smell,
p242
aVwhich has the throughput of a hard disk.
p243
aVAnd then you have poor old taste,
p244
aVwhich is like barely the throughput of a pocket calculator.
p245
aVAnd that little square in the corner, a naught .7 percent,
p246
aVthat's the amount we're actually aware of.
p247
aVSo a lot of your vision \u2014
p248
aVthe bulk of it is visual, and it's pouring in.
p249
aVIt's unconscious.
p250
aVThe eye is exquisitely sensitive
p251
aVto patterns in variations in color, shape and pattern.
p252
aVIt loves them, and it calls them beautiful.
p253
aVIt's the language of the eye.
p254
aVIf you combine the language of the eye with the language of the mind,
p255
aVwhich is about words and numbers and concepts,
p256
aVyou start speaking two languages simultaneously,
p257
aVeach enhancing the other.
p258
aVSo, you have the eye, and then you drop in the concepts.
p259
aVAnd that whole thing \u2014 it's two languages
p260
aVboth working at the same time.
p261
aa(lp262
VSo we can use this new kind of language, if you like,
p263
aVto alter our perspective or change our views.
p264
aVLet me ask you a simple question
p265
aVwith a really simple answer:
p266
aVWho has the biggest military budget?
p267
aVIt's got to be America, right?
p268
aVMassive. 609 billion in 2008 \u2014
p269
aV607, rather.
p270
aVSo massive, in fact, that it can contain
p271
aVall the other military budgets in the world inside itself.
p272
aVGobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.
p273
aVNow, you can see Africa's total debt there
p274
aVand the U.K. budget deficit for reference.
p275
aVSo that might well chime
p276
aVwith your view that America
p277
aVis a sort of warmongering military machine,
p278
aVout to overpower the world
p279
aVwith its huge industrial-military complex.
p280
aVBut is it true that America has the biggest military budget?
p281
aVBecause America is an incredibly rich country.
p282
aVIn fact, it's so massively rich
p283
aVthat it can contain the four other
p284
aVtop industrialized nations' economies
p285
aVinside itself, it's so vastly rich.
p286
aVSo its military budget is bound to be enormous.
p287
aVSo, to be fair and to alter our perspective,
p288
aVwe have to bring in another data set,
p289
aVand that data set is GDP, or the country's earnings.
p290
aVWho has the biggest budget as a proportion of GDP?
p291
aVLet's have a look.
p292
aVThat changes the picture considerably.
p293
aVOther countries pop into view that you, perhaps, weren't considering,
p294
aVand American drops into eighth.
p295
aa(lp296
VNow you can also do this with soldiers.
p297
aVWho has the most soldiers? It's got to be China.
p298
aVOf course, 2.1 million.
p299
aVAgain, chiming with your view
p300
aVthat China has a militarized regime
p301
aVready to, you know, mobilize its enormous forces.
p302
aVBut of course, China has an enormous population.
p303
aVSo if we do the same,
p304
aVwe see a radically different picture.
p305
aVChina drops to 124th.
p306
aVIt actually has a tiny army
p307
aVwhen you take other data into consideration.
p308
aVSo, absolute figures, like the military budget,
p309
aVin a connected world,
p310
aVdon't give you the whole picture.
p311
aVThey're not as true as they could be.
p312
aa(lp313
VWe need relative figures that are connected to other data
p314
aVso that we can see a fuller picture,
p315
aVand then that can lead to us changing our perspective.
p316
aVAs Hans Rosling, the master,
p317
aVmy master, said,
p318
aV"Let the dataset change your mindset."
p319
aVAnd if it can do that, maybe it can also change your behavior.
p320
aa(lp321
VTake a look at this one.
p322
aVI'm a bit of a health nut.
p323
aVI love taking supplements and being fit,
p324
aVbut I can never understand what's going on in terms of evidence.
p325
aVThere's always conflicting evidence.
p326
aVShould I take vitamin C? Should I be taking wheatgrass?
p327
aVThis is a visualization of all the evidence
p328
aVfor nutritional supplements.
p329
aVThis kind of diagram is called a balloon race.
p330
aVSo the higher up the image,
p331
aVthe more evidence there is for each supplement.
p332
aVAnd the bubbles correspond to popularity as regards to Google hits.
p333
aVSo you can immediately apprehend
p334
aVthe relationship between efficacy and popularity,
p335
aVbut you can also, if you grade the evidence,
p336
aVdo a "worth it" line.
p337
aVSo supplements above this line are worth investigating,
p338
aVbut only for the conditions listed below,
p339
aVand then the supplements below the line
p340
aVare perhaps not worth investigating.
p341
aa(lp342
VNow this image constitutes a huge amount of work.
p343
aVWe scraped like 1,000 studies from PubMed,
p344
aVthe biomedical database,
p345
aVand we compiled them and graded them all.
p346
aVAnd it was incredibly frustrating for me
p347
aVbecause I had a book of 250 visualizations to do for my book,
p348
aVand I spent a month doing this,
p349
aVand I only filled two pages.
p350
aVBut what it points to
p351
aVis that visualizing information like this
p352
aVis a form of knowledge compression.
p353
aVIt's a way of squeezing an enormous amount
p354
aVof information and understanding
p355
aVinto a small space.
p356
aVAnd once you've curated that data, and once you've cleaned that data,
p357
aVand once it's there,
p358
aVyou can do cool stuff like this.
p359
aa(lp360
VSo I converted this into an interactive app,
p361
aVso I can now generate this application online \u2014
p362
aVthis is the visualization online \u2014
p363
aVand I can say, "Yeah, brilliant."
p364
aVSo it spawns itself.
p365
aVAnd then I can say, "Well, just show me the stuff
p366
aVthat affects heart health."
p367
aVSo let's filter that out.
p368
aVSo heart is filtered out, so I can see if I'm curious about that.
p369
aVI think, "No, no. I don't want to take any synthetics,
p370
aVI just want to see plants and \u2014
p371
aVjust show me herbs and plants. I've got all the natural ingredients."
p372
aVNow this app is spawning itself
p373
aVfrom the data.
p374
aVThe data is all stored in a Google Doc,
p375
aVand it's literally generating itself from that data.
p376
aVSo the data is now alive; this is a living image,
p377
aVand I can update it in a second.
p378
aVNew evidence comes out. I just change a row on a spreadsheet.
p379
aVDoosh! Again, the image recreates itself.
p380
aVSo it's cool.
p381
aVIt's kind of living.
p382
aa(lp383
VBut it can go beyond data,
p384
aVand it can go beyond numbers.
p385
aVI like to apply information visualization
p386
aVto ideas and concepts.
p387
aVThis is a visualization
p388
aVof the political spectrum,
p389
aVan attempt for me to try
p390
aVand understand how it works
p391
aVand how the ideas percolate down
p392
aVfrom government into society and culture,
p393
aVinto families, into individuals, into their beliefs
p394
aVand back around again in a cycle.
p395
aVWhat I love about this image
p396
aVis it's made up of concepts,
p397
aVit explores our worldviews
p398
aVand it helps us \u2014 it helps me anyway \u2014
p399
aVto see what others think,
p400
aVto see where they're coming from.
p401
aVAnd it feels just incredibly cool to do that.
p402
aa(lp403
VWhat was most exciting for me
p404
aVdesigning this
p405
aVwas that, when I was designing this image,
p406
aVI desperately wanted this side, the left side,
p407
aVto be better than the right side \u2014
p408
aVbeing a journalist, a Left-leaning person \u2014
p409
aVbut I couldn't, because I would have created
p410
aVa lopsided, biased diagram.
p411
aVSo, in order to really create a full image,
p412
aVI had to honor the perspectives on the right-hand side
p413
aVand at the same time, uncomfortably recognize
p414
aVhow many of those qualities were actually in me,
p415
aVwhich was very, very annoying and uncomfortable.
p416
aV(Laughter)
p417
aVBut not too uncomfortable,
p418
aVbecause there's something unthreatening
p419
aVabout seeing a political perspective,
p420
aVversus being told or forced to listen to one.
p421
aVYou're capable of holding conflicting viewpoints
p422
aVjoyously when you can see them.
p423
aVIt's even fun to engage with them
p424
aVbecause it's visual.
p425
aVSo that's what's exciting to me,
p426
aVseeing how data can change my perspective
p427
aVand change my mind midstream \u2014
p428
aVbeautiful, lovely data.
p429
aa(lp430
VSo, just to wrap up,
p431
aVI wanted to say
p432
aVthat it feels to me that design is about solving problems
p433
aVand providing elegant solutions,
p434
aVand information design is about
p435
aVsolving information problems.
p436
aVIt feels like we have a lot of information problems
p437
aVin our society at the moment,
p438
aVfrom the overload and the saturation
p439
aVto the breakdown of trust and reliability
p440
aVand runaway skepticism and lack of transparency,
p441
aVor even just interestingness.
p442
aVI mean, I find information just too interesting.
p443
aVIt has a magnetic quality that draws me in.
p444
aa(lp445
VSo, visualizing information
p446
aVcan give us a very quick solution to those kinds of problems.
p447
aVEven when the information is terrible,
p448
aVthe visual can be quite beautiful.
p449
aVOften we can get clarity
p450
aVor the answer to a simple question very quickly,
p451
aVlike this one,
p452
aVthe recent Icelandic volcano.
p453
aVWhich was emitting the most CO2?
p454
aVWas it the planes or the volcano,
p455
aVthe grounded planes or the volcano?
p456
aVSo we can have a look.
p457
aVWe look at the data and we see:

VAnyone in the room thought about sex today?
p5
aV(Laughter)
p6
aVYeah, you did.
p7
aVThank you for putting your hand up over there.
p8
aVWell, I'm here to provide you with
p9
aVsome biological validation
p10
aVfor your sordid daydreams.
p11
aVI'm here to tell you a few things
p12
aVthat you might not have known about wild sex.
p13
aa(lp14
VNow, when humans think about sex,
p15
aVmale and female forms
p16
aVare generally what come to mind,
p17
aVbut for many millions of years,
p18
aVsuch specific categories didn't even exist.
p19
aVSex was a mere fusion of bodies
p20
aVor a trickle of DNA
p21
aVshared between two or more beings.
p22
aVIt wasn't until about 500 million years ago
p23
aVthat we start to see structures akin to a penis
p24
aVor a thing that gives DNA out,
p25
aVand a vagina, something that receives it.
p26
aVNow invariably, you're probably thinking about
p27
aVwhat belongs to our own species,
p28
aVthese very familiar structures,
p29
aVbut the diversity that we see in sexual structures
p30
aVin the animal kingdom that has evolved
p31
aVin response to the multitude of factors
p32
aVsurrounding reproduction
p33
aVis pretty mind-blowing.
p34
aa(lp35
VPenile diversity is especially profuse.
p36
aVSo this is a paper nautilus.
p37
aVIt's a close relative of squid and octopus,
p38
aVand males have a hectocotylus.
p39
aVJust what is a hectocotylus?
p40
aVA detachable, swimming penis.
p41
aVIt leaves the [body of the male],
p42
aVfinds the female through pheromonal cues in the water,
p43
aVattaches itself to her body
p44
aVand deposits the sperm.
p45
aVFor many decades, biologists actually felt
p46
aVthat the hectocotylus was a separate organism altogether.
p47
aVNow, the tapir is a mammal from South America.
p48
aVAnd the tapir has a prehensile penis.
p49
aVIt actually has a level of dexterity in its penis
p50
aVmuch akin to what we have with our hands.
p51
aVAnd it uses this dexterity
p52
aVto bypass the vagina altogether
p53
aVand deposit sperm directly into the female's uterus,
p54
aVnot to mention it's a pretty good size.
p55
aVThe biggest penis in the animal kingdom,
p56
aVhowever, is not that of the tapir.
p57
aVThe biggest penis-to-body-size ratio
p58
aVin the animal kingdom actually belongs
p59
aVto the meager beach barnacle,
p60
aVand this video is actually showing you
p61
aVwhat the human penis would look like
p62
aVif it were the same size as that of a barnacle.
p63
aV(Laughter)
p64
aVMm-hm. (Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VSo with all of this diversity in structure,
p67
aVone might think, then, that penises
p68
aVare fitting neatly into vaginas all over the place
p69
aVfor the purposes of successful reproduction.
p70
aVSimply insert part A into slot B,
p71
aVand we should all be good to go.
p72
aVBut of course, that doesn't exactly happen,
p73
aVand that's because we can't just take form into account.
p74
aVWe have to think about function as well,
p75
aVand when it comes to sex,
p76
aVfunction relates to the contributions made
p77
aVby the gametes, or the sperm and the eggs.
p78
aVAnd these contributions are far from equal.
p79
aVEggs are very expensive to make,
p80
aVso it makes sense for females to be very choosy
p81
aVabout who she shares them with.
p82
aVSperm, on the other hand, is abundant and cheap,
p83
aVso it makes more sense for males
p84
aVto have a more-sex-is-better strategy
p85
aVwhen it comes to siring members
p86
aVof future generations.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo how do animals cope
p89
aVwith these very incongruent needs between the sexes?
p90
aVI mean, if a female doesn't choose a particular male,
p91
aVor if she has the ability to store sperm
p92
aVand she simply has enough,
p93
aVthen it makes more sense for her to spend her time
p94
aVdoing other biologically relevant things:
p95
aVavoiding predators, taking care of offspring,
p96
aVgathering and ingesting food.
p97
aVThis is, of course, bad news for any male
p98
aVwho has yet to make a deposit in her sperm bank,
p99
aVand this sets the scene for some pretty drastic strategies
p100
aVfor successful fertilization.
p101
aVThis is bedbug sex,
p102
aVand it's aptly termed traumatic insemination.
p103
aVMales have a spiked, barbed penis
p104
aVthat they literally stab into the female,
p105
aVand they don't stab it anywhere near her vagina.
p106
aVThey stab it anywhere in her body,
p107
aVand the sperm simply migrates
p108
aVthrough her hemolymph to her ovaries.
p109
aVIf a female gets too many stab wounds,
p110
aVor if a stab wound happens to become infected,
p111
aVshe can actually die from it.
p112
aa(lp113
VNow if you've ever been out for a nice,
p114
aVpeaceful walk by the lake
p115
aVand happened to see some ducks having sex,
p116
aVyou've undoubtedly been alarmed,
p117
aVbecause it looks like gang rape.
p118
aVAnd quite frankly, that's exactly what it is.
p119
aVA group of males will grab a female,
p120
aVhold her down,
p121
aVand ballistically ejaculate their spiral-shaped penis
p122
aVinto her corkscrew-shaped vagina
p123
aVover and over and over again.
p124
aVFrom flaccid to ejaculation in less than a second.
p125
aVNow the female actually gets the last laugh, though,
p126
aVbecause she can actually manipulate her posture
p127
aVso as to allow the sperm of certain suitors
p128
aVbetter access to her ovaries.
p129
aa(lp130
VNow, I like to share stories like this with my audiences
p131
aVbecause, yeah, we humans,
p132
aVwe tend to think sex, sex is fun, sex is good,
p133
aVthere's romance, and there's orgasm.
p134
aVBut orgasm didn't actually evolve
p135
aVuntil about 65 million years ago
p136
aVwith the advent of mammals.
p137
aVBut some animals had it going on quite a bit before that.
p138
aVThere are some more primitive ways
p139
aVof pleasing one's partner.
p140
aa(lp141
VEarwig males have either
p142
aVreally large penile appendages
p143
aVor really small ones.
p144
aVIt's a very simple genetically inherited trait
p145
aVand the males are not otherwise any different.
p146
aVThose that have long penile appendages
p147
aVare not bigger or stronger
p148
aVor otherwise any different at all.
p149
aVSo going back to our biological minds, then,
p150
aVwe might think that females should choose
p151
aVto have sex with the guys that have the shorter appendages,
p152
aVbecause she can use her time for other things:
p153
aVavoiding predators, taking care of young,
p154
aVfinding and ingesting food.
p155
aVBut biologists have repeatedly observed
p156
aVthat females choose to have sex
p157
aVwith the males that have the long appendages.
p158
aVWhy do they do this?
p159
aVWell, according to the biological literature,
p160
aV"During copulation, the genitalia of certain males
p161
aVmay elicit more favorable female responses
p162
aVthrough superior mechanical or stimulatory interaction
p163
aVwith the female reproductive tract."
p164
aVMm-hm.
p165
aa(lp166
VThese are Mexican guppies,
p167
aVand what you see on their upper maxilla
p168
aVis an outgrowth of epidermal filaments,
p169
aVand these filaments basically form
p170
aVa fish mustache, if you will.
p171
aVNow males have been observed to prod
p172
aVthe female's genital opening
p173
aVprior to copulating with her,
p174
aVand in what I have lovingly termed the Magnum, P.I. hypothesis,
p175
aVfemales are overwhelmingly more likely to be found
p176
aVwith males that have these fish mustaches.
p177
aVA little guppy porn for you right there.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo we've seen very different strategies
p180
aVthat males are using when it comes to
p181
aVwinning a female partner.
p182
aVWe've seen a coercion strategy in which sexual structures are used in a forceful way
p183
aVto basically make a female have sex.
p184
aVWe've also seen a titillation strategy
p185
aVwhere males are actually
p186
aVpleasing their female partners into choosing them
p187
aVas a sex partner.
p188
aVNow unfortunately, in the animal kingdom,
p189
aVit's the coercion strategy that we see
p190
aVtime and time again.
p191
aVIt's very common in many phyla,
p192
aVfrom invertebrates to avian species,
p193
aVmammals, and, of course, even in primates.
p194
aa(lp195
VNow interestingly, there  are a few mammalian species
p196
aVin which females have evolved specialized genitalia
p197
aVthat doesn't allow for sexual coercion to take place.
p198
aVFemale elephants and female hyenas
p199
aVhave a penile clitoris,
p200
aVor an enlarged clitoral tissue that hangs externally,
p201
aVmuch like a penis,
p202
aVand in fact it's very difficult to sex these animals
p203
aVby merely looking at their external morphology.
p204
aVSo before a male can insert his penis into a female's vagina,
p205
aVshe has to take this penile clitoris
p206
aVand basically inside-out it in her own body.
p207
aVI mean, imagine putting a penis into another penis.
p208
aVIt's simply not going to happen
p209
aVunless the female is on board with the action.
p210
aVNow, even more interesting is the fact
p211
aVthat elephant and hyena societies
p212
aVare entirely matriarchal:
p213
aVthey're run by females, groups of females,
p214
aVsisters, aunts and offspring,
p215
aVand when young males attain sexual maturity,
p216
aVthey're turfed out of the group.
p217
aVIn hyena societies, adult males
p218
aVare actually the lowest on the social scale.
p219
aVThey can take part in a kill only after
p220
aVeverybody else, including the offspring.
p221
aVSo it seems that when you take the penis power
p222
aVaway from a male,
p223
aVyou take away all the social power he has.
p224
aa(lp225
VSo what are my take-home messages from my talk today?
p226
aVWell, sex is just so much more
p227
aVthan insert part A into slot B
p228
aVand hope that the offspring run around everywhere.
p229
aVThe sexual strategies and reproductive structures
p230
aVthat we see in the animal kingdom basically
p231
aVdictate how males and females will react to each other,
p232
aVwhich then dictates how populations and societies
p233
aVform and evolve.
p234
aa(lp235
VSo it may not be surprising to any of you
p236
aVthat animals, including ourselves,
p237
aVspend a good amount of time thinking about sex,
p238
aVbut what might surprise you is the extent to which
p239
aVso many other aspects of their lives and our lives
p240
aVare influenced by it.
p241
aa(lp242
VSo thank you, and happy daydreaming.

VHave you ever experienced a moment in your life
p5
aVthat was so painful and confusing,
p6
aVthat all you wanted to do
p7
aVwas learn as much as you could to make sense of it all?
p8
aVWhen I was 13, a close family friend who was like an uncle to me
p9
aVpassed away from pancreatic cancer.
p10
aVWhen the disease hit so close to home,
p11
aVI knew I needed to learn more.
p12
aVSo I went online to find answers.
p13
aVUsing the Internet, I found a variety of statistics on pancreatic cancer,
p14
aVand what I had found shocked me.
p15
aVOver 85 percent of all pancreatic cancers are diagnosed late,
p16
aVwhen someone has less than a two percent chance of survival.
p17
aVWhy are we so bad at detecting pancreatic cancer?
p18
aVThe reason?
p19
aVToday's current "modern" medicine is a 60-year-old technique.
p20
aVThat's older than my dad.
p21
aV(Laughter)
p22
aVBut also, it's extremely expensive, costing 800 dollars per test,
p23
aVand it's grossly inaccurate, missing 30 percent of all pancreatic cancers.
p24
aVYour doctor would have to be ridiculously suspicious that you have the cancer
p25
aVin order to give you this test.
p26
aVLearning this, I knew there had to be a better way.
p27
aVSo, I set up scientific criteria
p28
aVas to what a sensor would have to look like
p29
aVin order to effectively diagnose pancreatic cancer.
p30
aVThe sensor would have to be:
p31
aVinexpensive, rapid, simple, sensitive,
p32
aVselective, and minimally invasive.
p33
aVNow, there's a reason why this test hasn't been updated in over six decades.
p34
aVAnd that's because when we're looking for pancreatic cancer,
p35
aVwe're looking at your bloodstream,
p36
aVwhich is already abundant in all these tons and tons of protein,
p37
aVand you're looking for this miniscule difference in this tiny amount of protein.
p38
aVJust this one protein.
p39
aVThat's next to impossible.
p40
aVHowever, undeterred due to my teenage optimism \u2014
p41
aV(Laughter)
p42
aV(Applause)
p43
aVI went online to a teenager's two best friends, Google and Wikipedia.
p44
aVI got everything for my homework from those two sources.
p45
aV(Laughter)
p46
aVAnd what I had found was an article
p47
aVthat listed a database of over 8,000 different proteins
p48
aVthat are found when you have pancreatic cancer.
p49
aVSo, I decided to go and make it my new mission
p50
aVto go through all these proteins,
p51
aVand see which ones could serve as a bio-marker for pancreatic cancer.
p52
aVAnd to make it a bit simpler for myself,
p53
aVI decided to map out scientific criteria, and here it is.
p54
aVEssentially, first, the protein would have to be found in all pancreatic cancers,
p55
aVat high levels in the bloodstream,
p56
aVin the earliest stages, but also only in cancer.
p57
aVAnd so I'm just plugging and chugging through this gargantuan task,
p58
aVand finally, on the 4,000th try,
p59
aVwhen I'm close to losing my sanity,
p60
aVI find the protein.
p61
aVAnd the name of the protein I'd located was called mesothelin,
p62
aVand it's just your ordinary, run-of-the-mill type protein,
p63
aVunless, of course, you have pancreatic, ovarian or lung cancer,
p64
aVin which case it's found at these very high levels in your bloodstream.
p65
aVBut also, the key is that it's found in the earliest stages of the disease,
p66
aVwhen someone has close to 100 percent chance of survival.
p67
aVSo now that I'd found a reliable protein I could detect,
p68
aVI then shifted my focus to actually detecting that protein,
p69
aVand thus, pancreatic cancer.
p70
aVNow, my breakthrough came in a very unlikely place,
p71
aVpossibly the most unlikely place for innovation \u2014
p72
aVmy high school biology class, the absolute stifler of innovation.
p73
aV(Laughter)
p74
aV(Applause)
p75
aVAnd I had snuck in this article on these things called carbon nanotubes,
p76
aVand that's just a long, thin pipe of carbon
p77
aVthat's an atom thick, and one 50,000th the diameter of your hair.
p78
aVAnd despite their extremely small sizes,
p79
aVthey have these incredible properties.
p80
aVThey're kind of like the superheroes of material science.
p81
aVAnd while I was sneakily reading this article under my desk in my biology class,
p82
aVwe were supposed to be paying attention to these other kind of cool molecules,
p83
aVcalled antibodies.
p84
aVAnd these are pretty cool because they only react
p85
aVwith one specific protein,
p86
aVbut they're not nearly as interesting as carbon nanotubes.
p87
aVAnd so then, I was sitting in class, and suddenly it hit me:
p88
aVI could combine what I was reading about, carbon nanotubes,
p89
aVwith what I was supposed to be thinking about, antibodies.
p90
aVEssentially, I could weave a bunch of these antibodies
p91
aVinto a network of carbon nanotubes,
p92
aVsuch that you have a network that only reacts with one protein,
p93
aVbut also, due to the properties of these nanotubes,
p94
aVit will change its electrical properties,
p95
aVbased on the amount of protein present.
p96
aVHowever, there's a catch.
p97
aVThese networks of carbon nanotubes are extremely flimsy.
p98
aVAnd since they're so delicate, they need to be supported.
p99
aVSo that's why I chose to use paper.
p100
aVMaking a cancer sensor out of paper is about as simple
p101
aVas making chocolate chip cookies, which I love.
p102
aV(Laughs)
p103
aVYou start with some water, pour in some nanotubes,
p104
aVadd antibodies, mix it up, take some paper, dip it, dry it,
p105
aVand you can detect cancer.
p106
aV(Applause)
p107
aVThen, suddenly, a thought occurred
p108
aVthat kind of put a blemish on my amazing plan here.
p109
aVI can't really do cancer research on my kitchen countertop.
p110
aVMy mom wouldn't really like that.
p111
aVSo instead, I decided to go for a lab.
p112
aVSo I typed up a budget, a materials list, a timeline, and a procedure,
p113
aVand I emailed it to 200 different professors
p114
aVat Johns Hopkins University and the National Institutes of Health \u2014
p115
aVessentially, anyone that had anything to do with pancreatic cancer.
p116
aVI sat back waiting for these positive emails to be pouring in,
p117
aVsaying, "You're a genius! You're going to save us all!"
p118
aVAnd \u2014
p119
aV(Laughter)
p120
aVThen reality took hold, and over the course of a month,
p121
aVI got 199 rejections out of those 200 emails.
p122
aVOne professor even went through my entire procedure,
p123
aVpainstakingly \u2014 I'm not really sure where he got all this time \u2014
p124
aVand he went through and said why each and every step
p125
aVwas like the worst mistake I could ever make.
p126
aVClearly, the professors did not have as high of an opinion of my work as I did.
p127
aVHowever, there is a silver lining.
p128
aVOne professor said, "Maybe I might be able to help you, kid."
p129
aVSo, I went in that direction.
p130
aV(Laughter)
p131
aVAs you can never say no to a kid.
p132
aVAnd so then, three months later,
p133
aVI finally nailed down a harsh deadline with this guy,
p134
aVand I get into his lab, I get all excited, and then I sit down,
p135
aVI start opening my mouth and talking,
p136
aVand five seconds later, he calls in another Ph.D.
p137
aVPh.D.s just flock into this little room,
p138
aVand they're just firing these questions at me,
p139
aVand by the end, I kind of felt like I was in a clown car.
p140
aVThere were 20 Ph.D.s, plus me and the professor
p141
aVcrammed into this tiny office space,
p142
aVwith them firing these rapid-fire questions at me,
p143
aVtrying to sink my procedure.
p144
aVHow unlikely is that? I mean, pshhh.
p145
aV(Laughter)
p146
aVHowever, subjecting myself to that interrogation \u2014
p147
aVI answered all their questions, and I guessed on quite a few
p148
aVbut I got them right \u2014
p149
aVand I finally landed the lab space I needed.
p150
aVBut it was shortly afterwards that I discovered my once brilliant procedure
p151
aVhad something like a million holes in it,
p152
aVand over the course of seven months,
p153
aVI painstakingly filled each and every one of those holes.
p154
aVThe result?
p155
aVOne small paper sensor that costs three cents and takes five minutes to run.
p156
aVThis makes it 168 times faster,
p157
aVover 26,000 times less expensive,
p158
aVand over 400 times more sensitive than our current standard
p159
aVfor pancreatic cancer detection.
p160
aV(Applause)
p161
aVOne of the best parts of the sensor, though,
p162
aVis that it has close to 100 percent accuracy,
p163
aVand can detect the cancer in the earliest stages,
p164
aVwhen someone has close to 100 percent chance of survival.
p165
aVAnd so in the next two to five years,
p166
aVthis sensor could potentially lift the pancreatic cancer survival rates
p167
aVfrom a dismal 5.5 percent to close to 100 percent,
p168
aVand it would do similar for ovarian and lung cancer.
p169
aVBut it wouldn't stop there.
p170
aVBy switching out that antibody,
p171
aVyou can look at a different protein, thus, a different disease \u2014
p172
aVpotentially any disease in the entire world.
p173
aVSo that ranges from heart disease, to malaria, HIV, AIDS,
p174
aVas well as other forms of cancer \u2014 anything.
p175
aVAnd so, hopefully one day,
p176
aVwe can all have that one extra uncle,
p177
aVthat one mother, that one brother, sister,
p178
aVwe can have that one more family member to love.
p179
aVAnd that our hearts will be rid of that one disease burden
p180
aVthat comes from pancreatic, ovarian and lung cancer,
p181
aVand potentially any disease.
p182
aVBut through the Internet, anything is possible.
p183
aVTheories can be shared,
p184
aVand you don't have to be a professor with multiple degrees
p185
aVto have your ideas valued.
p186
aVIt's a neutral space, where what you look like, age or gender \u2014
p187
aVit doesn't matter.
p188
aVIt's just your ideas that count.
p189
aVFor me, it's all about looking at the Internet in an entirely new way,
p190
aVto realize that there's so much more to it
p191
aVthan just posting duck-face pictures of yourself online.
p192
aV(Laughter)
p193
aVYou could be changing the world.
p194
aVSo if a 15 year-old who didn't even know what a pancreas was
p195
aVcould find a new way to detect pancreatic cancer \u2014
p196
aVjust imagine what you could do.
p197
aVThank you.
p198
aV(Applause)

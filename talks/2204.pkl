VTwenty-five years ago, scientists at CERN created the World Wide Web.
p5
aVSince then, the Internet has transformed  the way we communicate,
p6
aVthe way we do business, and even the way we live.
p7
aVIn many ways,
p8
aVthe ideas that gave birth to Google, Facebook, Twitter, and so many others,
p9
aVhave now really transformed our lives,
p10
aVand this has brought us many real benefits such as a more connected society.
p11
aVHowever, there are also some downsides to this.
p12
aVToday, the average person has an astounding amount
p13
aVof personal information online,
p14
aVand we add to this online information every single time we post on Facebook,
p15
aVeach time we search on Google,
p16
aVand each time we send an email.
p17
aa(lp18
VNow, many of us probably think,
p19
aVwell, one email, there's nothing in there, right?
p20
aVBut if you consider a year's worth of emails,
p21
aVor maybe even a lifetime of email,
p22
aVcollectively, this tells a lot.
p23
aVIt tells where we have been, who we have met,
p24
aVand in many ways, even what we're thinking about.
p25
aVAnd the more scary part about this is our data now lasts forever,
p26
aVso your data can and will outlive you.
p27
aVWhat has happened is that we've largely lost control over our data
p28
aVand also our privacy.
p29
aa(lp30
VSo this year, as the web turns 25,
p31
aVit's very important for us to take a moment
p32
aVand think about the implications of this.
p33
aVWe have to really think.
p34
aVWe've lost privacy, yes,
p35
aVbut actually what we've also lost is the idea of privacy itself.
p36
aVIf you think about it,
p37
aVmost of us here today probably remember  what life was like before the Internet,
p38
aVbut today, there's a new generation
p39
aVthat is being taught from a very young age to share everything online,
p40
aVand this is a generation that is not  going to remember when data was private.
p41
aVSo we keep going down this road, 20 years from now,
p42
aVthe word 'privacy' is going to have a completely different meaning
p43
aVfrom what it means to you and I.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo, it's time for us  to take a moment and think,
p46
aVis there anything we can do about this?
p47
aVAnd I believe there is.
p48
aa(lp49
VLet's take a look at one of the most widely used forms of communication
p50
aVin the world today: email.
p51
aVBefore the invention of email, we largely communicated using letters,
p52
aVand the process was quite simple.
p53
aVYou would first start by writing your message on a piece of paper,
p54
aVthen you would place it into a sealed envelope,
p55
aVand from there, you would go ahead and send it
p56
aVafter you put a stamp and address on it.
p57
aVUnfortunately, today,
p58
aVwhen we actually send an email, we're not sending a letter.
p59
aVWhat you are sending, in many ways, is actually a postcard,
p60
aVand it's a postcard in the sense that everybody that sees it
p61
aVfrom the time it leaves your computer to when it gets to the recipient
p62
aVcan actually read the entire contents.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo, the solution to this has been known for some time,
p65
aVand there's many attempts to do it.
p66
aVThe most basic solution is to use encryption,
p67
aVand the idea is quite simple.
p68
aVFirst, you encrypt the connection
p69
aVbetween your computer and the email server.
p70
aVThen, you also encrypt the data as it sits on the server itself.
p71
aVBut there's a problem with this,
p72
aVand that is, the email servers also hold the encryption keys,
p73
aVso now you have a really big lock with a key placed right next to it.
p74
aVBut not only that, any government could lawfully ask for
p75
aVand get the key to your data,
p76
aVand this is all without you being aware of it.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo the way we fix this problem is actually relatively easy, in principle:
p79
aVYou give everybody their own keys,
p80
aVand then you make sure the server doesn't actually have the keys.
p81
aVThis seems like common sense, right?
p82
aVSo the question that comes up is, why hasn't this been done yet?
p83
aa(lp84
VWell, if we really think about it,
p85
aVwe see that the business model of the Internet today
p86
aVreally isn't compatible with privacy.
p87
aVJust take a look at some of the biggest names on the web,
p88
aVand you see that advertising plays a huge role.
p89
aVIn fact, this year alone, advertising is 137 billion dollars,
p90
aVand to optimize the ads that are shown to us,
p91
aVcompanies have to know everything about us.
p92
aVThey need to know where we live,
p93
aVhow old we are, what we like, what we don't like,
p94
aVand anything else they can get their hands on.
p95
aVAnd if you think about it,
p96
aVthe best way to get this information is really just to invade our privacy.
p97
aVSo these companies aren't going to give us our privacy.
p98
aVIf we want to have privacy online,
p99
aVwhat we have to do is we've got to go out and get it ourselves.
p100
aa(lp101
VFor many years, when it came to email,
p102
aVthe only solution was something known as PGP,
p103
aVwhich was quite complicated and only accessible to the tech-savvy.
p104
aVHere's a diagram that basically shows
p105
aVthe process for encrypting and decrypting messages.
p106
aVSo needless to say, this is not a solution for everybody,
p107
aVand this actually is part of the problem,
p108
aVbecause if you think about communication,
p109
aVby definition, it involves having someone to communicate with.
p110
aVSo while PGP does a great job of what it's designed to do,
p111
aVfor the people out there who can't understand how to use it,
p112
aVthe option to communicate privately simply does not exist.
p113
aVAnd this is a problem that we need to solve.
p114
aVSo if we want to have privacy online,
p115
aVthe only way we can succeed is if we get the whole world on board,
p116
aVand this is only possible if we bring down the barrier to entry.
p117
aVI think this is actually the key challenge that lies in the tech community.
p118
aVWhat we really have to do is work and make privacy more accessible.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo last summer, when the Edward Snowden story came out,
p121
aVseveral colleagues and I decided to see if we could make this happen.
p122
aVAt that time, we were working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research
p123
aVat the world's largest particle collider, which collides protons, by the way.
p124
aVWe were all scientists, so we used our scientific creativity
p125
aVand came up with a very creative name for our project:
p126
aVProtonMail. (Laughter)
p127
aVMany startups these days actually begin in people's garages
p128
aVor people's basements.
p129
aVWe were a bit different.
p130
aVWe started out at the CERN cafeteria,
p131
aVwhich actually is great, because look,
p132
aVyou have all the food and water you could ever want.
p133
aVBut even better than this is that every day
p134
aVbetween 12 p.m. and 2 p.m., free of charge,
p135
aVthe CERN cafeteria comes with several thousand scientists and engineers,
p136
aVand these guys basically know the answers to everything.
p137
aVSo it was in this environment that we began working.
p138
aVWhat we actually want to do is we want to take your email
p139
aVand turn it into something that looks more like this,
p140
aVbut more importantly, we want to do it in a way
p141
aVthat you can't even tell that it's happened.
p142
aVSo to do this, we actually need a combination of technology
p143
aVand also design.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo how do we go about doing something like this?
p146
aVWell, it's probably a good idea not to put the keys on the server.
p147
aVSo what we do is we generate encryption keys on your computer,
p148
aVand we don't generate a single key, but actually a pair of keys,
p149
aVso there's an RSA private key and an RSA public key,
p150
aVand these keys are mathematically connected.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo let's have a look and see how this works
p153
aVwhen multiple people communicate.
p154
aVSo here we have Bob and Alice, who want to communicate privately.
p155
aVSo the key challenge is to take Bob's message
p156
aVand to get it to Alice in such a way that the server cannot read that message.
p157
aVSo what we have to do is we have to encrypt it
p158
aVbefore it even leaves Bob's computer,
p159
aVand one of the tricks is, we encrypt it using the public key from Alice.
p160
aVNow this encrypted data is sent through the server to Alice,
p161
aVand because the message was encrypted using Alice's public key,
p162
aVthe only key that can now decrypt it is a private key that belongs to Alice,
p163
aVand it turns out Alice is the only person that actually has this key.
p164
aVSo we've now accomplished the objective,
p165
aVwhich is to get the message from Bob to Alice
p166
aVwithout the server being able to read what's going on.
p167
aa(lp168
VActually, what I've shown here is a highly simplified picture.
p169
aVThe reality is much more complex
p170
aVand it requires a lot of software that looks a bit like this.
p171
aVAnd that's actually the key design challenge:
p172
aVHow do we take all this complexity, all this software,
p173
aVand implement it in a way that the user cannot see it.
p174
aVI think with ProtonMail, we have gotten pretty close to doing this.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo let's see how it works in practice.
p177
aVHere, we've got Bob and Alice again,
p178
aVwho also want to communicate securely.
p179
aVThey simply create accounts on ProtonMail,
p180
aVwhich is quite simple and takes a few moments,
p181
aVand all the key encryption and generation
p182
aVis happening automatically in the background
p183
aVas Bob is creating his account.
p184
aVOnce his account is created, he just clicks "compose,"
p185
aVand now he can write his email like he does today.
p186
aVSo he fills in his information,
p187
aVand then after that,  all he has to do is click "send,"
p188
aVand just like that, without understanding cryptography,
p189
aVand without doing anything different from how he writes email today,
p190
aVBob has just sent an encrypted message.
p191
aa(lp192
VWhat we have here is really just the first step,
p193
aVbut it shows that with improving technology,
p194
aVprivacy doesn't have to be difficult, it doesn't have to be disruptive.
p195
aVIf we change the goal from maximizing  ad revenue to protecting data,
p196
aVwe can actually make it accessible.
p197
aVNow, I know a question on everybody's minds is,
p198
aVokay, protecting privacy, this is a great goal,
p199
aVbut can you actually do this
p200
aVwithout the tons of money that advertisements give you?
p201
aVAnd I think the answer is actually yes,
p202
aVbecause today, we've reached a point
p203
aVwhere people around the world really understand how important privacy is,
p204
aVand when you have that, anything is possible.
p205
aVEarlier this year,
p206
aVProtonMail actually had so many users  that we ran out of resources,
p207
aVand when this happened, our community of users got together
p208
aVand donated half a million dollars.
p209
aVSo this is just an example of what can happen
p210
aVwhen you bring the community together towards a common goal.
p211
aVWe can also leverage the world.
p212
aVRight now,
p213
aVwe have a quarter of a million people that have signed up for ProtonMail,
p214
aVand these people come from everywhere,
p215
aVand this really shows that privacy
p216
aVis not just an American or a European issue,
p217
aVit's a global issue that impacts all of us.
p218
aVIt's something that we really have to pay attention to going forward.
p219
aa(lp220
VSo what do we have to do to solve this problem?
p221
aVWell, first of all,
p222
aVwe need to support a different business model for the Internet,
p223
aVone that does not rely entirely on advertisements
p224
aVfor revenue and for growth.
p225
aVWe actually need to build a new Internet
p226
aVwhere our privacy and our ability  to control our data is first and foremost.
p227
aVBut even more importantly,
p228
aVwe have to build an Internet  where privacy is no longer just an option
p229
aVbut is also the default.
p230
aa(lp231
VWe have done the first step with ProtonMail,
p232
aVbut this is really just the first step in a very, very long journey.
p233
aVThe good news I can share with you guys today,
p234
aVthe exciting news, is that we're not traveling alone.
p235
aVThe movement to protect people's privacy and freedom online
p236
aVis really gaining momentum,
p237
aVand today, there are dozens of projects from all around the world
p238
aVwho are working together to improve our privacy.
p239
aVThese projects protect things from our chat to voice communications,
p240
aValso our file storage, our online search,
p241
aVour online browsing, and many other things.
p242
aVAnd these projects are not backed by billions of dollars in advertising,
p243
aVbut they've found support really from the people,
p244
aVfrom private individuals like you and I from all over the world.
p245
aa(lp246
VThis really matters, because ultimately,
p247
aVprivacy depends on each and every one of us,
p248
aVand we have to protect it now because our online data
p249
aVis more than just a collection of ones and zeros.
p250
aVIt's actually a lot more than that.
p251
aVIt's our lives, our personal stories,
p252
aVour friends, our families,
p253
aVand in many ways, also our hopes and our aspirations.
p254
aVWe need to spend time now to really protect our right
p255
aVto share this only with people that we want to share this with,
p256
aVbecause without this, we simply can't have a free society.
p257
aVSo now's the time for us to collectively stand up and say,
p258
aVyes, we do want to live in a world with online privacy,
p259
aVand yes, we can work together to turn this vision into a reality.
p260
aa(lp261
VThank you.

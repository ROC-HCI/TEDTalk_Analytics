VWe live in difficult and challenging
p5
aVeconomic times, of course.
p6
aVAnd one of the first victims
p7
aVof difficult economic times,
p8
aVI think, is public spending of any kind,
p9
aVbut certainly in the firing line at the moment
p10
aVis public spending for science,
p11
aVand particularly curiosity-led science
p12
aVand exploration.
p13
aVSo I want to try and convince you in about 15 minutes
p14
aVthat that's a ridiculous
p15
aVand ludicrous thing to do.
p16
aa(lp17
VBut I think to set the scene,
p18
aVI want to show \u2014 the next slide is not my attempt
p19
aVto show the worst TED slide in the history of TED,
p20
aVbut it is a bit of a mess.
p21
aV(Laughter)
p22
aVBut actually, it's not my fault; it's from the Guardian newspaper.
p23
aVAnd it's actually a beautiful demonstration
p24
aVof how much science costs.
p25
aVBecause, if I'm going to make the case
p26
aVfor continuing to spend on curiosity-driven science and exploration,
p27
aVI should tell you how much it costs.
p28
aVSo this is a game called "spot the science budgets."
p29
aVThis is the U.K. government spend.
p30
aVYou see there, it's about 620 billion a year.
p31
aa(lp32
VThe science budget is actually \u2014
p33
aVif you look to your left, there's a purple set of blobs
p34
aVand then yellow set of blobs.
p35
aVAnd it's one of the yellow set of blobs
p36
aVaround the big yellow blob.
p37
aVIt's about 3.3 billion pounds per year
p38
aVout of 620 billion.
p39
aVThat funds everything in the U.K.
p40
aVfrom medical research, space exploration,
p41
aVwhere I work, at CERN in Geneva, particle physics,
p42
aVengineering, even arts and humanities,
p43
aVfunded from the science budget,
p44
aVwhich is that 3.3 billion, that little, tiny yellow blob
p45
aVaround the orange blob at the top left of the screen.
p46
aVSo that's what we're arguing about.
p47
aVThat percentage, by the way, is about the same
p48
aVin the U.S. and Germany and France.
p49
aVR&D in total in the economy,
p50
aVpublicly funded, is about
p51
aV0.6 percent of GDP.
p52
aVSo that's what we're arguing about.
p53
aa(lp54
VThe first thing I want to say,
p55
aVand this is straight from "Wonders of the Solar System,"
p56
aVis that our exploration of the solar system and the universe
p57
aVhas shown us that it is indescribably beautiful.
p58
aVThis is a picture that actually was sent back
p59
aVby the Cassini space probe around Saturn,
p60
aVafter we'd finished filming "Wonders of the Solar System."
p61
aVSo it isn't in the series.
p62
aVIt's of the moon Enceladus.
p63
aVSo that big sweeping, white
p64
aVsphere in the corner is Saturn,
p65
aVwhich is actually in the background of the picture.
p66
aVAnd that crescent there is the moon Enceladus,
p67
aVwhich is about as big as the British Isles.
p68
aVIt's about 500 kilometers in diameter.
p69
aVSo, tiny moon.
p70
aVWhat's fascinating and beautiful ...
p71
aVthis an unprocessed picture, by the way, I should say,
p72
aVit's black and white, straight from Saturnian orbit.
p73
aa(lp74
VWhat's beautiful is, you can probably see on the limb there
p75
aVsome faint, sort of,
p76
aVwisps of almost smoke
p77
aVrising up from the limb.
p78
aVThis is how we visualize that in "Wonders of the Solar System."
p79
aVIt's a beautiful graphic.
p80
aVWhat we found out were that those faint wisps
p81
aVare actually fountains of ice
p82
aVrising up from the surface of this tiny moon.
p83
aVThat's fascinating and beautiful in itself,
p84
aVbut we think that the mechanism
p85
aVfor powering those fountains
p86
aVrequires there to be lakes of liquid water
p87
aVbeneath the surface of this moon.
p88
aVAnd what's important about that
p89
aVis that, on our planet, on Earth,
p90
aVwherever we find liquid water,
p91
aVwe find life.
p92
aVSo, to find strong evidence
p93
aVof liquid, pools of liquid, beneath the surface of a moon
p94
aV750 million miles away from the Earth
p95
aVis really quite astounding.
p96
aVSo what we're saying, essentially,
p97
aVis maybe that's a habitat for life in the solar system.
p98
aVWell, let me just say, that was a graphic. I just want to show this picture.
p99
aVThat's one more picture of Enceladus.
p100
aVThis is when Cassini flew beneath Enceladus.
p101
aVSo it made a very low pass,
p102
aVjust a few hundred kilometers above the surface.
p103
aVAnd so this, again, a real picture of the ice fountains rising up into space,
p104
aVabsolutely beautiful.
p105
aa(lp106
VBut that's not the prime candidate for life in the solar system.
p107
aVThat's probably this place,
p108
aVwhich is a moon of Jupiter, Europa.
p109
aVAnd again, we had to fly to the Jovian system
p110
aVto get any sense that this moon, as most moons,
p111
aVwas anything other than a dead ball of rock.
p112
aVIt's actually an ice moon.
p113
aVSo what you're looking at is the surface of the moon Europa,
p114
aVwhich is a thick sheet of ice, probably a hundred kilometers thick.
p115
aVBut by measuring the way that
p116
aVEuropa interacts
p117
aVwith the magnetic field of Jupiter,
p118
aVand looking at how those cracks in the ice
p119
aVthat you can see there on that graphic move around,
p120
aVwe've inferred very strongly
p121
aVthat there's an ocean of liquid surrounding
p122
aVthe entire surface of Europa.
p123
aVSo below the ice, there's an ocean of liquid around the whole moon.
p124
aVIt could be hundreds of kilometers deep, we think.
p125
aVWe think it's saltwater, and that would mean that
p126
aVthere's more water on that moon of Jupiter
p127
aVthan there is in all the oceans of the Earth combined.
p128
aVSo that place, a little moon around Jupiter,
p129
aVis probably the prime candidate
p130
aVfor finding life on a moon
p131
aVor a body outside the Earth, that we know of.
p132
aVTremendous and beautiful discovery.
p133
aa(lp134
VOur exploration of the solar system
p135
aVhas taught us that the solar system is beautiful.
p136
aVIt may also have pointed the way to answering
p137
aVone of the most profound questions that you can possibly ask,
p138
aVwhich is: "Are we alone in the universe?"
p139
aVIs there any other use to exploration and science,
p140
aVother than just a sense of wonder?
p141
aVWell, there is.
p142
aVThis is a very famous picture
p143
aVtaken, actually, on my first Christmas Eve,
p144
aVDecember 24th, 1968,
p145
aVwhen I was about eight months old.
p146
aVIt was taken by Apollo 8
p147
aVas it went around the back of the moon.
p148
aVEarthrise from Apollo 8.
p149
aVA famous picture; many people have said that it's the picture
p150
aVthat saved 1968,
p151
aVwhich was a turbulent year \u2014
p152
aVthe student riots in Paris,
p153
aVthe height of the Vietnam War.
p154
aVThe reason many people think that about this picture,
p155
aVand Al Gore has said it many times, actually, on the stage at TED,
p156
aVis that this picture, arguably, was
p157
aVthe beginning of the environmental movement.
p158
aVBecause, for the first time,
p159
aVwe saw our world,
p160
aVnot as a solid, immovable,
p161
aVkind of indestructible place,
p162
aVbut as a very small, fragile-looking world
p163
aVjust hanging against the blackness of space.
p164
aa(lp165
VWhat's also not often said
p166
aVabout the space exploration, about the Apollo program,
p167
aVis the economic contribution it made.
p168
aVI mean while you can make arguments that it was wonderful
p169
aVand a tremendous achievement
p170
aVand delivered pictures like this,
p171
aVit cost a lot, didn't it?
p172
aVWell, actually, many studies have been done
p173
aVabout the economic effectiveness,
p174
aVthe economic impact of Apollo.
p175
aVThe biggest one was in 1975 by Chase Econometrics.
p176
aVAnd it showed that for every $1 spent on Apollo,
p177
aV14 came back into the U.S. economy.
p178
aVSo the Apollo program paid for itself
p179
aVin inspiration,
p180
aVin engineering, achievement
p181
aVand, I think, in inspiring young scientists and engineers
p182
aV14 times over.
p183
aVSo exploration can pay for itself.
p184
aa(lp185
VWhat about scientific discovery?
p186
aVWhat about driving innovation?
p187
aVWell, this looks like a picture of virtually nothing.
p188
aVWhat it is, is a picture of the spectrum
p189
aVof hydrogen.
p190
aVSee, back in the 1880s, 1890s,
p191
aVmany scientists, many observers,
p192
aVlooked at the light given off from atoms.
p193
aVAnd they saw strange pictures like this.
p194
aVWhat you're seeing when you put it through a prism
p195
aVis that you heat hydrogen up and it doesn't just glow
p196
aVlike a white light,
p197
aVit just emits light at particular colors,
p198
aVa red one, a light blue one, some dark blue ones.
p199
aVNow that led to an understanding of atomic structure
p200
aVbecause the way that's explained
p201
aVis atoms are a single nucleus
p202
aVwith electrons going around them.
p203
aVAnd the electrons can only be in particular places.
p204
aVAnd when they jump up to the next place they can be,
p205
aVand fall back down again,
p206
aVthey emit light at particular colors.
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd so the fact that atoms, when you heat them up,
p209
aVonly emit light at very specific colors,
p210
aVwas one of the key drivers
p211
aVthat led to the development of the quantum theory,
p212
aVthe theory of the structure of atoms.
p213
aVI just wanted to show this picture because this is remarkable.
p214
aVThis is actually a picture of the spectrum of the Sun.
p215
aVAnd now, this is a picture of atoms in the Sun's atmosphere
p216
aVabsorbing light.
p217
aVAnd again, they only absorb light at particular colors
p218
aVwhen electrons jump up and fall down,
p219
aVjump up and fall down.
p220
aVBut look at the number of black lines in that spectrum.
p221
aVAnd the element helium
p222
aVwas discovered just by staring at the light from the Sun
p223
aVbecause some of those black lines were found
p224
aVthat corresponded to no known element.
p225
aVAnd that's why helium's called helium.
p226
aVIt's called "helios" \u2014 helios from the Sun.
p227
aa(lp228
VNow, that sounds esoteric,
p229
aVand indeed it was an esoteric pursuit,
p230
aVbut the quantum theory quickly led
p231
aVto an understanding of the behaviors of electrons in materials
p232
aVlike silicon, for example.
p233
aVThe way that silicon behaves,
p234
aVthe fact that you can build transistors,
p235
aVis a purely quantum phenomenon.
p236
aVSo without that curiosity-driven
p237
aVunderstanding of the structure of atoms,
p238
aVwhich led to this rather esoteric theory, quantum mechanics,
p239
aVthen we wouldn't have transistors, we wouldn't have silicon chips,
p240
aVwe wouldn't have pretty much the basis
p241
aVof our modern economy.
p242
aa(lp243
VThere's one more, I think, wonderful twist to that tale.
p244
aVIn "Wonders of the Solar System,"
p245
aVwe kept emphasizing the laws of physics are universal.
p246
aVIt's one of the most incredible things about the physics
p247
aVand the understanding of nature that you get on Earth,
p248
aVis you can transport it, not only to the planets,
p249
aVbut to the most distant stars and galaxies.
p250
aVAnd one of the astonishing predictions
p251
aVof quantum mechanics,
p252
aVjust by looking at the structure of atoms \u2014
p253
aVthe same theory that describes transistors \u2014
p254
aVis that there can be no stars in the universe
p255
aVthat have reached the end of their life
p256
aVthat are bigger than, quite specifically, 1.4 times the mass of the Sun.
p257
aVThat's a limit imposed on the mass of stars.
p258
aVYou can work it out on a piece of paper in a laboratory,
p259
aVget a telescope, swing it to the sky,
p260
aVand you find that there are no dead stars
p261
aVbigger than 1.4 times the mass of the Sun.
p262
aVThat's quite an incredible prediction.
p263
aa(lp264
VWhat happens when you have a star that's right on the edge of that mass?
p265
aVWell, this is a picture of it.
p266
aVThis is the picture of a galaxy, a common "our garden" galaxy
p267
aVwith, what, 100 billion
p268
aVstars like our Sun in it.
p269
aVIt's just one of billions of galaxies in the universe.
p270
aVThere are a billion stars in the galactic core,
p271
aVwhich is why it's shining out so brightly.
p272
aVThis is about 50 million light years away,
p273
aVso one of our neighboring galaxies.
p274
aVBut that bright star there
p275
aVis actually one of the stars in the galaxy.
p276
aVSo that star is also
p277
aV50 million light years away.
p278
aVIt's part of that galaxy, and it's shining as brightly
p279
aVas the center of the galaxy
p280
aVwith a billion suns in it.
p281
aVThat's a Type Ia supernova explosion.
p282
aVNow that's an incredible phenomena,
p283
aVbecause it's a star that sits there.
p284
aVIt's called a carbon-oxygen dwarf.
p285
aVIt sits there about, say, 1.3 times the mass of the Sun.
p286
aVAnd it has a binary companion that goes around it,
p287
aVso a big star, a big ball of gas.
p288
aVAnd what it does is it sucks gas
p289
aVoff its companion star,
p290
aVuntil it gets to this limit called the Chandrasekhar limit,
p291
aVand then it explodes.
p292
aVAnd it explodes, and it shines as brightly
p293
aVas a billion suns for about two weeks,
p294
aVand releases, not only energy,
p295
aVbut a huge amount of chemical elements into the universe.
p296
aVIn fact, that one is a carbon-oxygen dwarf.
p297
aa(lp298
VNow, there was no carbon and oxygen
p299
aVin the universe at the Big Bang.
p300
aVAnd there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe
p301
aVthroughout the first generation of stars.
p302
aVIt was made in stars like that,
p303
aVlocked away and then returned to the universe
p304
aVin explosions like that
p305
aVin order to recondense into planets,
p306
aVstars, new solar systems
p307
aVand, indeed, people like us.
p308
aVI think that's a remarkable demonstration of the power
p309
aVand beauty and universality of the laws of physics,
p310
aVbecause we understand that process,
p311
aVbecause we understand
p312
aVthe structure of atoms here on Earth.
p313
aa(lp314
VThis is a beautiful quote that I found \u2014
p315
aVwe're talking about serendipity there \u2014 from Alexander Fleming:
p316
aV"When I woke up just after dawn
p317
aVon September 28, 1928,
p318
aVI certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine
p319
aVby discovering the world's first antibiotic."
p320
aVNow, the explorers of the world of the atom
p321
aVdid not intend to invent the transistor.
p322
aVAnd they certainly didn't intend to
p323
aVdescribe the mechanics of supernova explosions,
p324
aVwhich eventually told us where
p325
aVthe building blocks of life
p326
aVwere synthesized in the universe.
p327
aVSo, I think science can be \u2014
p328
aVserendipity is important.
p329
aVIt can be beautiful. It can reveal quite astonishing things.
p330
aVIt can also, I think, finally
p331
aVreveal the most profound
p332
aVideas to us
p333
aVabout our place in the universe
p334
aVand really the value of our home planet.
p335
aa(lp336
VThis is a spectacular picture of our home planet.
p337
aVNow, it doesn't look like our home planet.
p338
aVIt looks like Saturn because, of course, it is.
p339
aVIt was taken by the Cassini space probe.
p340
aVBut it's a famous picture, not because of
p341
aVthe beauty and majesty of Saturn's rings,
p342
aVbut actually because of a tiny, faint blob
p343
aVjust hanging underneath one of the rings.
p344
aVAnd if I blow it up there, you see it.
p345
aVIt looks like a moon,
p346
aVbut in fact, it's a picture of Earth.
p347
aVIt was a picture of Earth captured in that frame of Saturn.
p348
aVThat's our planet from 750 million miles away.
p349
aVI think the Earth has got a strange property
p350
aVthat the farther away you get from it,
p351
aVthe more beautiful it seems.
p352
aa(lp353
VBut that is not the most distant or most famous picture of our planet.
p354
aVIt was taken by this thing, which is called the Voyager spacecraft.
p355
aVAnd that's a picture of me in front of it for scale.
p356
aVThe Voyager is a tiny machine.
p357
aVIt's currently 10 billion miles away from Earth,
p358
aVtransmitting with that dish, with the power of 20 watts,
p359
aVand we're still in contact with it.
p360
aVBut it visited Jupiter, Saturn,
p361
aVUranus and Neptune.
p362
aVAnd after it visited all four of those planets,
p363
aVCarl Sagan, who's one of my great heroes,
p364
aVhad the wonderful idea
p365
aVof turning Voyager around
p366
aVand taking a picture of every planet it had visited.
p367
aVAnd it took this picture of Earth.
p368
aVNow it's very hard to see the Earth there, it's called the "Pale Blue Dot" picture,
p369
aVbut Earth is suspended in that red shaft of light.
p370
aVThat's Earth from four billion miles away.
p371
aa(lp372
VAnd I'd like to read you what
p373
aVSagan wrote about it, just to finish,
p374
aVbecause I cannot say words as beautiful as this
p375
aVto describe what he saw
p376
aVin that picture that he had taken.
p377
aVHe said, "Consider again that dot.
p378
aVThat's here. That's home. That's us.
p379
aVOn it, everyone you love,
p380
aVeveryone you know, everyone you've ever heard of,
p381
aVevery human being who ever was
p382
aVlived out their lives.
p383
aVThe aggregates of joy and suffering
p384
aVthousands of confident religions,
p385
aVideologies and economic doctrines,
p386
aVevery hunter and forager, every hero and coward,
p387
aVevery creator and destroyer of civilization,
p388
aVevery king and peasant, every young couple in love,
p389
aVevery mother and father, hopeful child,
p390
aVinventor and explorer,
p391
aVevery teacher of morals, every corrupt politician,
p392
aVevery superstar, every supreme leader,
p393
aVevery saint and sinner in the history of our species,
p394
aVlived there, on a mote of dust,
p395
aVsuspended in a sunbeam.
p396
aVIt's been said that astronomy's a humbling
p397
aVand character-building experience.
p398
aVThere is perhaps no better demonstration
p399
aVof the folly of human conceits
p400
aVthan this distant image of our tiny world.
p401
aVTo me, it underscores our responsibility
p402
aVto deal more kindly with one another
p403
aVand to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot,
p404
aVthe only home we've ever known."
p405
aa(lp406
VBeautiful words about
p407
aVthe power of science and exploration.
p408
aVThe argument has always been made, and it will always be made,
p409
aVthat we know enough about the universe.
p410
aVYou could have made it in the 1920s; you wouldn't have had penicillin.
p411
aVYou could have made it in the 1890s; you wouldn't have the transistor.
p412
aVAnd it's made today in these difficult economic times.
p413
aVSurely, we know enough.
p414
aVWe don't need to discover anything else about our universe.
p415
aa(lp416
VLet me leave the last words to someone
p417
aVwho's rapidly becoming a hero of mine,
p418
aVHumphrey Davy, who did his science at the turn of the 19th century.
p419
aVHe was clearly under assault all the time.
p420
aV"We know enough at the turn of the 19th century.
p421
aVJust exploit it; just build things."
p422
aVHe said this, he said, "Nothing is more fatal
p423
aVto the progress of the human mind
p424
aVthan to presume that our views of science
p425
aVare ultimate,
p426
aVthat our triumphs are complete,
p427
aVthat there are no mysteries in nature,
p428
aVand that there are no new worlds to conquer."
p429
aa(lp430
VThank you.

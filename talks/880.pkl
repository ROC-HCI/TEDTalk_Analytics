VThose of you who may remember me from TEDGlobal
p5
aVremember me asking a few questions
p6
aVwhich still preoccupy me.
p7
aVOne of them was: Why is it necessary to spend
p8
aVsix billion pounds
p9
aVspeeding up the Eurostar train
p10
aVwhen, for about 10 percent of that money,
p11
aVyou could have top supermodels, male and female,
p12
aVserving free Chateau Petrus to all the passengers
p13
aVfor the entire duration of the journey?
p14
aVYou'd still have five billion left in change,
p15
aVand people would ask for the trains to be slowed down.
p16
aVNow, you may remember me asking the question as well,
p17
aVa very interesting observation,
p18
aVthat actually those strange little signs
p19
aVthat actually flash "35" at you,
p20
aVoccasionally accompanying a little smiley face
p21
aVor a frown,
p22
aVaccording to whether you're within or outside the speed limit \u2014
p23
aVthose are actually more effective
p24
aVat preventing road accidents than speed cameras,
p25
aVwhich come with the actual threat
p26
aVof real punishment.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo there seems to be a strange disproportionality at work,
p29
aVI think, in many areas of human problem solving,
p30
aVparticularly those which involve human psychology,
p31
aVwhich is: The tendency
p32
aVof the organization or the institution
p33
aVis to deploy as much force as possible,
p34
aVas much compulsion as possible,
p35
aVwhereas actually, the tendency of the person
p36
aVis to be almost influenced
p37
aVin absolute reverse proportion
p38
aVto the amount of force being applied.
p39
aVSo there seems to be a complete disconnect here.
p40
aVSo what I'm asking for is the creation of a new job title \u2014
p41
aVI'll come to this a little later \u2014
p42
aVand perhaps the addition of a new word
p43
aVinto the English language.
p44
aVBecause it does seem to me that large organizations
p45
aVincluding government, which is, of course, the largest organization of all,
p46
aVhave actually become
p47
aVcompletely disconnected
p48
aVwith what actually matters to people.
p49
aa(lp50
VLet me give you one example of this.
p51
aVYou may remember this as the AOL-Time Warner merger, okay,
p52
aVheralded at the time as the largest
p53
aVsingle deal of all time.
p54
aVIt may still be, for all I know.
p55
aVNow, all of you in this room, in one form or other,
p56
aVare probably customers of one or both
p57
aVof those organizations that merged.
p58
aVJust interested, did anybody notice anything different
p59
aVas a result of this at all?
p60
aVSo unless you happened to be a shareholder
p61
aVof one or the other organizations
p62
aVor one of the dealmakers or lawyers involved in the no-doubt lucrative activity,
p63
aVyou're actually engaging in a huge piece of activity
p64
aVthat meant absolutely bugger-all to anybody, okay?
p65
aVBy contrast, years of marketing have taught me
p66
aVthat if you actually want people to remember you
p67
aVand to appreciate what you do,
p68
aVthe most potent things are actually very, very small.
p69
aVThis is from Virgin Atlantic upper-class,
p70
aVit's the cruet salt and pepper set.
p71
aVQuite nice in itself, they're little, sort of, airplane things.
p72
aVWhat's really, really sweet is every single person looking at these things
p73
aVhas exactly the same mischievous thought,
p74
aVwhich is, "I reckon I can heist these."
p75
aVHowever, you pick them up and underneath,
p76
aVactually engraved in the metal, are the words,
p77
aV"Stolen from Virgin Atlantic Airways upper-class."
p78
aV(Laughter)
p79
aVNow, years after
p80
aVyou remember the strategic question
p81
aVof whether you're flying in a 777 or an Airbus,
p82
aVyou remember those words and that experience.
p83
aa(lp84
VSimilarly, this is from a hotel in Stockholm, the Lydmar.
p85
aVHas anybody stayed there?
p86
aVIt's the lift, it's a series of buttons in the lift.
p87
aVNothing unusual about that at all,
p88
aVexcept that these are actually not the buttons that take you to an individual floor.
p89
aVIt starts with garage at the bottom, I suppose, appropriately,
p90
aVbut it doesn't go up garage, grand floor, mezzanine, one, two, three, four.
p91
aVIt actually says garage, funk, rhythm and blues.
p92
aVYou have a series of buttons. You actually choose your lift music.
p93
aVMy guess is that the cost of installing this in the lift
p94
aVin the Lydmar Hotel in Stockholm
p95
aVis probably 500 to 1,000 pounds max.
p96
aVIt's frankly more memorable
p97
aVthan all those millions of hotels we've all stayed at
p98
aVthat tell you that your room has actually been recently renovated
p99
aVat a cost of 500,000 dollars,
p100
aVin order to make it resemble every other hotel room you've ever stayed in
p101
aVin the entire course of your life.
p102
aa(lp103
VNow, these are trivial marketing examples, I accept.
p104
aVBut I was at a TED event recently and Esther Duflo,
p105
aVprobably one of the leading experts in,
p106
aVeffectively, the eradication of poverty in the developing world,
p107
aVactually spoke.
p108
aVAnd she came across a similar example
p109
aVof something that fascinated me
p110
aVas being something which, in a business context or a government context,
p111
aVwould simply be so trivial a solution
p112
aVas to seem embarrassing.
p113
aVIt was simply to encourage the inoculation of children
p114
aVby, not only making it a social event \u2014
p115
aVI think good use of behavioral economics in that,
p116
aVif you turn up with several other mothers
p117
aVto have your child inoculated,
p118
aVyour sense of confidence is much greater than if you turn up alone.
p119
aVBut secondly, to incentivize that inoculation
p120
aVby giving a kilo of lentils to everybody who participated.
p121
aVIt's a tiny, tiny thing.
p122
aVIf you're a senior person at UNESCO
p123
aVand someone says, "So what are you doing
p124
aVto eradicate world poverty?"
p125
aVyou're not really confident standing up there
p126
aVsaying, "I've got it cracked; it's the lentils," are you?
p127
aa(lp128
VOur own sense of self-aggrandizement
p129
aVfeels that big important problems
p130
aVneed to have big important, and most of all, expensive
p131
aVsolutions attached to them.
p132
aVAnd yet, what behavioral economics shows time after time after time
p133
aVis in human behavioral and behavioral change
p134
aVthere's a very, very strong disproportionality at work,
p135
aVthat actually what changes our behavior
p136
aVand what changes our attitude to things
p137
aVis not actually proportionate to the degree
p138
aVof expense entailed,
p139
aVor the degree of force that's applied.
p140
aVBut everything about institutions
p141
aVmakes them uncomfortable
p142
aVwith that disproportionality.
p143
aVSo what happens in an institution
p144
aVis the very person who has the power to solve the problem
p145
aValso has a very, very large budget.
p146
aVAnd once you have a very, very large budget,
p147
aVyou actually look for expensive things to spend it on.
p148
aVWhat is completely lacking is a class of people
p149
aVwho have immense amounts of power, but no money at all.
p150
aV(Laughter)
p151
aVIt's those people I'd quite like to create
p152
aVin the world going forward.
p153
aa(lp154
VNow, here's another thing that happens,
p155
aVwhich is what I call sometimes "Terminal 5 syndrome,"
p156
aVwhich is that big, expensive things
p157
aVget big, highly-intelligent attention,
p158
aVand they're great, and Terminal 5 is absolutely magnificent,
p159
aVuntil you get down to the small detail, the usability,
p160
aVwhich is the signage,
p161
aVwhich is catastrophic.
p162
aVYou come out of "Arrive" at the airport, and you follow
p163
aVa big yellow sign that says "Trains" and it's in front of you.
p164
aVSo you walk for another hundred yards,
p165
aVexpecting perhaps another sign,
p166
aVthat might courteously be yellow, in front of you and saying "Trains."
p167
aVNo, no, no, the next one is actually blue, to your left,
p168
aVand says "Heathrow Express."
p169
aVI mean, it could almost be rather like that scene from the film "Airplane."
p170
aVA yellow sign? That's exactly what they'll be expecting.
p171
aa(lp172
VActually, what happens in the world increasingly \u2014
p173
aVnow, all credit to the British Airport Authority.
p174
aVI spoke about this before,
p175
aVand a brilliant person got in touch with me and said, "Okay, what can you do?"
p176
aVSo I did come up with five suggestions, which they are actually actioning.
p177
aVOne of them also being,
p178
aValthough logically it's quite a good idea
p179
aVto have a lift with no up and down button in it,
p180
aVif it only serves two floors,
p181
aVit's actually bloody terrifying, okay?
p182
aVBecause when the door closes
p183
aVand there's nothing for you to do,
p184
aVyou've actually just stepped into a Hammer film.
p185
aa(lp186
V(Laughter)
p187
aa(lp188
VSo these questions ... what is happening in the world
p189
aVis the big stuff, actually,
p190
aVis done magnificently well.
p191
aVBut the small stuff, what you might call the user interface,
p192
aVis done spectacularly badly.
p193
aVBut also, there seems to be a complete sort of gridlock
p194
aVin terms of solving these small solutions.
p195
aVBecause the people who can actually solve them
p196
aVactually are too powerful and too preoccupied
p197
aVwith something they think of as "strategy" to actually solve them.
p198
aVI tried this exercise recently, talking about banking.
p199
aVThey said, "Can we do an advertising campaign?
p200
aVWhat can we do and encourage more online banking?"
p201
aVI said, "It's really, really easy."
p202
aVI said, "When people login to their online bank
p203
aVthere are lots and lots of things they'd probably quite like to look at.
p204
aVThe last thing in the world you ever want to see is your balance."
p205
aVI've got friends who actually
p206
aVnever use their own bank cash machines
p207
aVbecause there's the risk that it might display
p208
aVtheir balance on the screen.
p209
aa(lp210
VWhy would you willingly expose yourself to bad news?
p211
aVOkay, you simply wouldn't.
p212
aVI said, "If you make, actually, 'Tell me my balance.'
p213
aVIf you make that an option rather than the default,
p214
aVyou'll find twice as many people log on to online banking,
p215
aVand they do it three times as often."
p216
aVLet's face it, most of us \u2014 how many of you
p217
aVactually check your balance before you remove cash from a cash machine?
p218
aVAnd you're pretty rich by the standards of the world at large.
p219
aVNow, interesting that no single person does that,
p220
aVor at least can admit to being so anal as to do it.
p221
aVBut what's interesting about that suggestion
p222
aVwas that, to implement that suggestion wouldn't cost 10 million pounds;
p223
aVit wouldn't involve large amounts of expenditure;
p224
aVit would actually cost about 50 quid.
p225
aVAnd yet, it never happens.
p226
aa(lp227
VBecause there's a fundamental disconnect, as I said,
p228
aVthat actually, the people with the power
p229
aVwant to do big expensive things.
p230
aVAnd there's to some extent a big strategy myth
p231
aVthat's prevalent in business now.
p232
aVAnd if you think about it, it's very, very important
p233
aVthat the strategy myth is maintained.
p234
aVBecause, if the board of directors convince everybody
p235
aVthat the success of any organization
p236
aVis almost entirely dependent on the decisions made by the board of directors,
p237
aVit makes the disparity in salaries
p238
aVslightly more justifiable
p239
aVthan if you actually acknowledge that quite a lot of the credit for a company's success
p240
aVmight actually lie somewhere else,
p241
aVin small pieces of tactical activity.
p242
aa(lp243
VBut what is happening is that effectively \u2014
p244
aVand the invention of the spreadsheet hasn't helped this;
p245
aVlots of things haven't helped this \u2014
p246
aVbusiness and government suffers from a kind of physics envy.
p247
aVIt wants the world to be the kind of place where
p248
aVthe input and the change are proportionate.
p249
aVIt's a kind of mechanistic world
p250
aVthat we'd all love to live in
p251
aVwhere, effectively, it sits very nicely on spreadsheets,
p252
aVeverything is numerically expressible,
p253
aVand the amount you spend on something is proportionate
p254
aVto the scale of your success.
p255
aVThat's the world people actually want.
p256
aVIn truth, we do live in a world that science can understand.
p257
aVUnfortunately, the science is probably closer to being climatology
p258
aVin that in many cases,
p259
aVvery, very small changes
p260
aVcan have disproportionately huge effects,
p261
aVand equally, vast areas of activity, enormous mergers,
p262
aVcan actually accomplish absolutely bugger-all.
p263
aVBut it's very, very uncomfortable for us
p264
aVto actually acknowledge that we're living in such a world.
p265
aa(lp266
VBut what I'm saying is we could just make things
p267
aVa little bit better for ourselves
p268
aVif we looked at it in this very simple four-way approach.
p269
aVThat is actually strategy, and I'm not denying that strategy has a role.
p270
aVYou know, there are cases where you spend quite a lot of money
p271
aVand you accomplish quite a lot.
p272
aVAnd I'd be wrong to dis that completely.
p273
aVMoving over, we come, of course, to consultancy.
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
VI thought it was very indecent of Accenture
p278
aVto ditch Tiger Woods in such
p279
aVa sort of hurried and hasty way.
p280
aVI mean, Tiger surely was actually obeying the Accenture model.
p281
aVHe developed an interesting outsourcing model for sexual services,
p282
aV(Laughter)
p283
aVno longer tied to a single monopoly provider,
p284
aVin many cases, sourcing things locally,
p285
aVand of course, the ability to have between one and three girls delivered at any time
p286
aVled for better load-balancing.
p287
aVSo what Accenture suddenly found so unattractive about that, I'm not sure.
p288
aa(lp289
VThen there are other things that don't cost much and achieve absolutely nothing.
p290
aVThat's called trivia.
p291
aVBut there's a fourth thing.
p292
aVAnd the fundamental problem is we don't actually have a word for this stuff.
p293
aVWe don't know what to call it.
p294
aVAnd actually we don't spend nearly enough money
p295
aVlooking for those things,
p296
aVlooking for those tiny things that may or may not work,
p297
aVbut which, if they do work,
p298
aVcan have a success absolutely out of proportion
p299
aVto their expense, their efforts
p300
aVand the disruption they cause.
p301
aa(lp302
VSo the first thing I'd like
p303
aVis a competition \u2014 to anybody watching this as a film \u2014
p304
aVis to come up with a name for that stuff on the bottom right.
p305
aVAnd the second thing, I think,
p306
aVis that the world needs to have people in charge of that.
p307
aVThat's why I call for the "Chief Detail Officer."
p308
aVEvery corporation should have one,
p309
aVand every government should have a Ministry of Detail.
p310
aVThe people who actually have no money,
p311
aVwho have no extravagant budget,
p312
aVbut who realize that actually
p313
aVyou might achieve greater success in uptake
p314
aVof a government program
p315
aVby actually doubling the level of benefits you pay,
p316
aVbut you'll probably achieve exactly that same effect
p317
aVsimply by redesigning the form
p318
aVand writing it in comprehensible English.
p319
aVAnd if actually we created a Ministry of Detail
p320
aVand business actually had Chief Detail Officers,
p321
aVthen that fourth quadrant,
p322
aVwhich is so woefully neglected at the moment,
p323
aVmight finally get the attention it deserves.
p324
aa(lp325
VThank you very much.

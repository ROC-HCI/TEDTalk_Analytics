VLauren Hodge: If you were going to a restaurant and wanted a healthier option,
p5
aVwhich would you choose, grilled or fried chicken?
p6
aVNow most people would answer grilled,
p7
aVand it's true that grilled chicken does contain less fat and fewer calories.
p8
aVHowever, grilled chicken poses a hidden danger.
p9
aVThe hidden danger is heterocyclic amines \u2014
p10
aVspecifically phenomethylimidazopyridine,
p11
aVor PhIP \u2014
p12
aV(laughter)
p13
aVwhich is the immunogenic or carcinogenic compound.
p14
aa(lp15
VA carcinogen is any substance or agent
p16
aVthat causes abnormal growth of cells,
p17
aVwhich can also cause them to metastasize or spread.
p18
aVThey are also organic compounds
p19
aVin which one or more of the hydrogens in ammonia
p20
aVis replaced with a more complex group.
p21
aVStudies show that antioxidants
p22
aVare known to decrease these heterocyclic amines.
p23
aVHowever, no studies exist yet
p24
aVthat show how or why.
p25
aVThese here are five different organizations that classify carcinogens.
p26
aVAnd as you can see, none of the organizations consider the compounds to be safe,
p27
aVwhich justifies the need to decrease them in our diet.
p28
aa(lp29
VNow you might wonder how a 13 year-old girl could come up with this idea.
p30
aVAnd I was led to it through a series of events.
p31
aVI first learned about it through a lawsuit I read about in my doctor's office \u2014
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aVwhich was between the Physician's Committee for Responsible Medicine
p34
aVand seven different fast food restaurants.
p35
aVThey weren't sued because there was carcinogens in the chicken,
p36
aVbut they were sued because of California's Proposition 65,
p37
aVwhich stated that if there's anything dangerous in the products
p38
aVthen the companies had to give a clear warning.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo I was very surprised about this.
p41
aVAnd I was wondering why nobody knew more
p42
aVabout this dangerous grilled chicken,
p43
aVwhich doesn't seem very harmful.
p44
aVBut then one night, my mom was cooking grilled chicken for dinner,
p45
aVand I noticed that the edges of the chicken,
p46
aVwhich had been marinated in lemon juice, turned white.
p47
aVAnd later in biology class, I learned that it's due to a process called denaturing,
p48
aVwhich is where the proteins will change shape
p49
aVand lose their ability to chemically function.
p50
aVSo I combined these two ideas and I formulated a hypothesis,
p51
aVsaying that, could possibly
p52
aVthe carcinogens be decreased due to a marinade
p53
aVand could it be due to the differences in PH?
p54
aa(lp55
VSo my idea was born,
p56
aVand I had the project set up and a hypothesis,
p57
aVso what was my next step?
p58
aVWell obviously I had to find a lab to work at
p59
aVbecause I didn't have the equipment in my school.
p60
aVI thought this would be easy,
p61
aVbut I emailed about 200 different people
p62
aVwithin a five-hour radius of where I lived,
p63
aVand I got one positive response that said that they could work with me.
p64
aVMost of the others either never responded back,
p65
aVsaid they didn't have the time
p66
aVor didn't have the equipment and couldn't help me.
p67
aVSo it was a big commitment
p68
aVto drive to the lab to work multiple times.
p69
aVHowever, it was a great opportunity to work in a real lab \u2014
p70
aVso I could finally start my project.
p71
aa(lp72
VThe first stage was completed at home,
p73
aVwhich consisted of marinating the chicken,
p74
aVgrilling the chicken, amassing it
p75
aVand preparing it to be transported to the lab.
p76
aVThe second stage was completed
p77
aVat the Penn State University main campus lab,
p78
aVwhich is where I extracted the chemicals,
p79
aVchanged the PH so I could run it through the equipment
p80
aVand separated the compounds I needed
p81
aVfrom the rest of the chicken.
p82
aVThe final stages, when I ran the samples
p83
aVthrough a high-pressure
p84
aVliquid chromatography mass spectrometer,
p85
aVwhich separated the compounds and analyzed the chemicals
p86
aVand told me exactly how much carcinogens I had
p87
aVin my chicken.
p88
aa(lp89
VSo when I went through the data, I had very surprising results,
p90
aVbecause I found that four out of the five marinating ingredients
p91
aVactually inhibited the carcinogen formation.
p92
aVWhen compared with the unmarinated chicken,
p93
aVwhich is what I used as my control,
p94
aVI found that lemon juice worked by far the best,
p95
aVwhich decreased the carcinogens
p96
aVby about 98 percent.
p97
aVThe saltwater marinade and the brown sugar marinade
p98
aValso worked very well,
p99
aVdecreasing the carcinogens by about 60 percent.
p100
aVOlive oil slightly decreased the PhIP formation,
p101
aVbut it was nearly negligible.
p102
aVAnd the soy sauce results were inconclusive
p103
aVbecause of the large data range,
p104
aVbut it seems like soy sauce
p105
aVactually increased the potential carcinogens.
p106
aa(lp107
VAnother important factor that I didn't take into account initially
p108
aVwas the time cooked.
p109
aVAnd I found that if you increase the time cooked,
p110
aVthe amount of carcinogens rapidly increases.
p111
aVSo the best way to marinate chicken, based on this,
p112
aVis to, not under-cook,
p113
aVbut definitely don't over-cook and char the chicken,
p114
aVand marinate in either lemon juice, brown sugar or saltwater.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Applause)
p117
aa(lp118
VBased on these findings, I have a question for you.
p119
aVWould you be willing to make a simple change in your diet
p120
aVthat could potentially save your life?
p121
aVNow I'm not saying that if you eat grilled chicken that's not marinated,
p122
aVyou're definitely going to catch cancer and die.
p123
aVHowever, anything you can do
p124
aVto decrease the risk of potential carcinogens
p125
aVcan definitely increase the quality of lifestyle.
p126
aa(lp127
VIs it worth it to you?
p128
aVHow will you cook your chicken now?
p129
aa(lp130
V(Applause)
p131
aa(lp132
VShree Bose: Hi everyone. I'm Shree Bose.
p133
aVI was the 17-18 year-old age category winner
p134
aVand then the grand prize winner.
p135
aVAnd I want all of you
p136
aVto imagine a little girl
p137
aVholding a dead blue spinach plant.
p138
aVAnd she's standing in front of you and she's explaining to you
p139
aVthat little kids will eat their vegetables
p140
aVif they're different colors.
p141
aVSounds ridiculous, right.
p142
aVBut that was me years ago.
p143
aVAnd that was my first science fair project.
p144
aVIt got a bit more complicated from there.
p145
aVMy older brother Panaki Bose
p146
aVspent hours of his time explaining atoms to me
p147
aVwhen I barely understood basic algebra.
p148
aVMy parents suffered through many more of my science fair projects,
p149
aVincluding a remote controlled garbage can.
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd then came the summer after my freshman year,
p154
aVwhen my grandfather passed away due to cancer.
p155
aVAnd I remember watching my family go through that
p156
aVand thinking that I never wanted another family
p157
aVto feel that kind of loss.
p158
aVSo, armed with all the wisdom
p159
aVof freshman year biology,
p160
aVI decided I wanted to do cancer research
p161
aVat 15.
p162
aVGood plan.
p163
aVSo I started emailing all of these professors in my area
p164
aVasking to work under their supervision in a lab.
p165
aVGot rejected by all except one.
p166
aVAnd then went on, my next summer,
p167
aVto work under Dr. Basu
p168
aVat the UNT Health Center at Fort Worth, Texas.
p169
aVAnd that is where the research began.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo ovarian cancer
p172
aVis one of those cancers that most people don't know about,
p173
aVor at least don't pay that much attention to.
p174
aVBut yet, it's the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths
p175
aVamong women in the United States.
p176
aVIn fact, one in 70 women
p177
aVwill be diagnosed with ovarian cancer.
p178
aVOne in 100
p179
aVwill die from it.
p180
aVChemotherapy, one of the most effective ways
p181
aVused to treat cancer today,
p182
aVinvolves giving patients really high doses of chemicals
p183
aVto try and kill off cancer cells.
p184
aa(lp185
VCisplatin is a relatively common
p186
aVovarian cancer chemotherapy drug \u2014
p187
aVa relatively simple molecule made in the lab
p188
aVthat messes with the DNA of cancer cells
p189
aVand causes them to kill themselves.
p190
aVSounds great, right?
p191
aVBut here's the problem:
p192
aVsometimes patients become resistant to the drug,
p193
aVand then years after they've been declared to be cancer free,
p194
aVthey come back.
p195
aVAnd this time, they no longer respond to the drug.
p196
aVIt's a huge problem.
p197
aVIn fact, it's one of the biggest problems
p198
aVwith chemotherapy today.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo we wanted to figure out
p201
aVhow these ovarian cancer cells are becoming resistant
p202
aVto this drug called Cisplatin.
p203
aVAnd we wanted to figure this out,
p204
aVbecause if we could figure that out,
p205
aVthen we might be able to prevent that resistance from ever happening.
p206
aVSo that's what we set out to do.
p207
aVAnd we thought it had something to do with this protein called AMP kinase,
p208
aVan energy protein.
p209
aVSo we ran all of these tests blocking the protein,
p210
aVand we saw this huge shift.
p211
aVI mean, on the slide, you can see
p212
aVthat on our sensitive side,
p213
aVthese cells that are responding to the drug,
p214
aVwhen we start blocking the protein,
p215
aVthe number of dying cells \u2014 those colored dots \u2014
p216
aVthey're going down.
p217
aVBut then on this side, with the same treatment,
p218
aVthey're going up \u2014 interesting.
p219
aa(lp220
VBut those are dots on a screen for you;
p221
aVwhat exactly does that mean?
p222
aVWell basically that means
p223
aVthat this protein is changing
p224
aVfrom the sensitive cell to the resistant cell.
p225
aVAnd in fact, it might be changing the cells themselves
p226
aVto make the cells resistant.
p227
aVAnd that's huge.
p228
aVIn fact, it means that if a patient comes in
p229
aVand they're resistant to this drug,
p230
aVthen if we give them a chemical to block this protein,
p231
aVthen we can treat them again
p232
aVwith the same drug.
p233
aVAnd that's huge for chemotherapy effectiveness \u2014
p234
aVpossibly for many different types of cancer.
p235
aVSo that was my work,
p236
aVand it was my way of reimagining the future
p237
aVfor future research, with figuring out exactly what this protein does,
p238
aVbut also for the future of chemotherapy effectiveness \u2014
p239
aVso maybe all grandfathers with cancer
p240
aVhave a little bit more time to spend with their grandchildren.
p241
aa(lp242
VBut my work wasn't just about the research.
p243
aVIt was about finding my passion.
p244
aVThat's why being the grand prize winner
p245
aVof the Google Global Science Fair \u2014
p246
aVcute picture, right \u2014
p247
aVit was so exciting to me and it was such an amazing honor.
p248
aVAnd ever since then,
p249
aVI've gotten to do some pretty cool stuff \u2014
p250
aVfrom getting to meet the president
p251
aVto getting to be on this stage
p252
aVto talk to all of you guys.
p253
aa(lp254
VBut like I said, my journey wasn't just about the research,
p255
aVit was about finding my passion,
p256
aVand it was about making my own opportunities
p257
aVwhen I didn't even know what I was doing.
p258
aVIt was about inspiration
p259
aVand determination
p260
aVand never giving up on my interest
p261
aVfor science and learning and growing.
p262
aVAfter all, my story begins
p263
aVwith a dried, withered spinach plant
p264
aVand it's only getting better from there.
p265
aa(lp266
VThank you.
p267
aa(lp268
V(Applause)
p269
aa(lp270
VNaomi Shah: Hi everyone. I'm Naomi Shah,
p271
aVand today I'll be talking to you about my research
p272
aVinvolving indoor air quality
p273
aVand asthmatic patients.
p274
aV1.6 million deaths worldwide.
p275
aVOne death every 20 seconds.
p276
aVPeople spend over 90 percent of their lives indoors.
p277
aVAnd the economic burden of asthma
p278
aVexceeds that of HIV and tuberculosis combined.
p279
aVNow these statistics had a huge impact on me,
p280
aVbut what really sparked my interest in my research
p281
aVwas watching both my dad and my brother
p282
aVsuffer from chronic allergies year-round.
p283
aVIt confused me;
p284
aVwhy did these allergy symptoms persist
p285
aVwell past the pollen season?
p286
aa(lp287
VWith this question in mind, I started researching,
p288
aVand I soon found that indoor air pollutants were the culprit.
p289
aVAs soon as I realized this,
p290
aVI investigated the underlying relationship
p291
aVbetween four prevalent air pollutants
p292
aVand their affect on the lung health of asthmatic patients.
p293
aVAt first, I just wanted to figure out
p294
aVwhich of these four pollutants have the largest negative health impact
p295
aVon the lung health of asthmatic patients.
p296
aVBut soon after, I developed a novel mathematical model
p297
aVthat essentially quantifies the effect
p298
aVof these environmental pollutants
p299
aVon the lung health of asthmatic patients.
p300
aVAnd it surprises me
p301
aVthat no model currently exists
p302
aVthat quantifies the effect of environmental factors
p303
aVon human lung health,
p304
aVbecause that relationship seems so important.
p305
aa(lp306
VSo with that in mind,
p307
aVI started researching more, I started investigating more,
p308
aVand I became very passionate.
p309
aVBecause I realized
p310
aVthat if we could find a way to target remediation,
p311
aVwe could also find a way
p312
aVto treat asthmatic patients more effectively.
p313
aVFor example, volatile organic compounds
p314
aVare chemical pollutants
p315
aVthat are found in our schools, homes and workplaces.
p316
aVThey're everywhere.
p317
aVThese chemical pollutants
p318
aVare currently not a criteria air pollutant,
p319
aVas defined by the U.S. Clean Air Act.
p320
aVWhich is surprising to me,
p321
aVbecause these chemical pollutants, through my research,
p322
aVI show that they had a very large negative impact
p323
aVon the lung health of asthmatic patients
p324
aVand thus should be regulated.
p325
aa(lp326
VSo today I want to show you
p327
aVmy interactive software model that I created.
p328
aVI'm going to show it to you on my laptop.
p329
aVAnd I have a volunteer subject in the audience today,
p330
aVJulie.
p331
aVAnd all of Julie's data has been pre-entered
p332
aVinto my interactive software model.
p333
aVAnd this can be used by anyone.
p334
aVSo I want you to imagine that you're in Julie's shoes,
p335
aVor someone who's really close to you
p336
aVwho suffers from asthma or another lung disorder.
p337
aVSo Julie's going to her doctor's office
p338
aVto get treated for her asthma.
p339
aVAnd the doctor has her sit down,
p340
aVand he takes her peak expiratory flow rate \u2014
p341
aVwhich is essentially her exhalation rate,
p342
aVor the amount of air that she can breathe out in one breath.
p343
aa(lp344
VSo that peak expiratory flow rate,
p345
aVI've entered it up into the interactive software model.
p346
aVI've also entered in her age, her gender and her height.
p347
aVI've assumed that she lives in an average household
p348
aVwith average air pollutant levels.
p349
aVSo any user can come in here
p350
aVand click on "lung function report"
p351
aVand it'll take them to this report that I created.
p352
aVAnd this report really drives home the crux of my research.
p353
aa(lp354
VSo what it shows \u2014 if you want to focus on that top graph in the right-hand corner \u2014
p355
aVit shows Julie's actual peak expiratory flow rate
p356
aVin the yellow bar.
p357
aVThis is the measurement that she took in her doctor's office.
p358
aVIn the blue bar at the bottom of the graph,
p359
aVit shows what her peak expiratory flow rate,
p360
aVwhat her exhalation rate or lung health, should be
p361
aVbased on her age, gender and height.
p362
aVSo the doctor sees this difference between the yellow bar and the blue bar,
p363
aVand he says, "Wow, we need to give her steroids,
p364
aVmedication and inhalers."
p365
aa(lp366
VBut I want everyone here to reimagine a world
p367
aVwhere instead of prescribing steroids,
p368
aVinhalers and medication,
p369
aVthe doctor turns to Julie and says,
p370
aV"Why don't you go home and clean out your air filters.
p371
aVClean out the air ducts in your home,
p372
aVin your workplace, in your school.
p373
aVStop the use of incense and candles.
p374
aVAnd if you're remodeling your house,
p375
aVtake out all the carpeting and put in hardwood flooring."
p376
aVBecause these solutions are natural,
p377
aVthese solutions are sustainable,
p378
aVand these solutions are long-term investments \u2014
p379
aVlong-term investments that we're making
p380
aVfor our generation and for future generations.
p381
aVBecause these environmental solutions
p382
aVthat Julie can make in her home, her workplace and her school
p383
aVare impacting everyone that lives around her.
p384
aa(lp385
VSo I'm very passionate about this research
p386
aVand I really want to continue it
p387
aVand expand it to more disorders besides asthma,
p388
aVmore respiratory disorders, as well as more pollutants.
p389
aVBut before I end my talk today,
p390
aVI want to leave you with one saying.
p391
aVAnd that saying is that genetics loads the gun,
p392
aVbut the environment pulls the trigger.
p393
aVAnd that made a huge impact on me
p394
aVwhen I was doing this research.
p395
aVBecause what I feel, is a lot of us think
p396
aVthat the environment is at a macro level,
p397
aVthat we can't do anything to change our air quality
p398
aVor to change the climate or anything.
p399
aa(lp400
VBut if each one of us takes initiative in our own home,
p401
aVin our own school and in our own workplace,
p402
aVwe can make a huge difference in air quality.
p403
aVBecause remember, we spend 90 percent of our lives indoors.
p404
aVAnd air quality and air pollutants
p405
aVhave a huge impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients,
p406
aVanyone with a respiratory disorder
p407
aVand really all of us in general.
p408
aa(lp409
VSo I want you to reimagine a world
p410
aVwith better air quality,
p411
aVbetter quality of life
p412
aVand better quality of living for everyone
p413
aVincluding our future generations.
p414
aa(lp415
VThank you.
p416
aa(lp417
V(Applause)
p418
aa(lp419
VLisa Ling: Right.
p420

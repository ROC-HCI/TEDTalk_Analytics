V"Pheromone" is a very powerful word.
p5
aVIt conjures up sex, abandon, loss of control,
p6
aVand you can see, it's very important as a word.
p7
aVBut it's only 50 years old. It was invented in 1959.
p8
aVNow, if you put that word into the web,
p9
aVas you may have done,
p10
aVyou'll come up with millions of hits,
p11
aVand almost all of those sites are trying to sell you
p12
aVsomething to make you irresistible
p13
aVfor 10 dollars or more.
p14
aVNow, this is a very attractive idea,
p15
aVand the molecules they mention
p16
aVsound really science-y.
p17
aVThey've got lots of syllables.
p18
aVIt's things like androstenol, androstenone
p19
aVor androstadienone.
p20
aVIt gets better and better,
p21
aVand when you combine that with white lab coats,
p22
aVyou must imagine that there is
p23
aVfantastic science behind this.
p24
aVBut sadly, these are fraudulent claims
p25
aVsupported by dodgy science.
p26
aa(lp27
VThe problem is that, although there are many
p28
aVgood scientists working on what they think
p29
aVare human pheromones,
p30
aVand they're publishing in respectable journals,
p31
aVat the basis of this,
p32
aVdespite very sophisticated experiments,
p33
aVthere really is no good science behind it,
p34
aVbecause it's based on a problem,
p35
aVwhich is nobody has systematically gone through
p36
aVall the odors that humans produce \u2014
p37
aVand there are thousands of molecules that we give off.
p38
aVWe're mammals. We produce a lot of smell.
p39
aVNobody has gone through systematically
p40
aVto work out which molecules really are pheromones.
p41
aVThey've just plucked a few,
p42
aVand all these experiments are based on those,
p43
aVbut there's no good evidence at all.
p44
aa(lp45
VNow, that's not to say
p46
aVthat smell is not important to people.
p47
aVIt is, and some people are real enthusiasts,
p48
aVand one of these was Napoleon.
p49
aVAnd famously, you may remember
p50
aVthat out on the campaign trail for war,
p51
aVhe wrote to his lover, Empress Josephine,
p52
aVsaying, "Don't wash. I'm coming home."
p53
aV(Laughter)
p54
aVSo he didn't want to lose any of her richness
p55
aVin the days before he'd get home,
p56
aVand it is still, you'll find websites
p57
aVthat offer this as a major quirk.
p58
aVAt the same time, though,
p59
aVwe spend about as much money
p60
aVtaking the smells off us
p61
aVas putting them back on in perfumes,
p62
aVand perfumes are a multi-billion-dollar business.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo what I want to do in the rest of this talk
p65
aVis tell you about what pheromones really are,
p66
aVtell you why I think we would expect
p67
aVhumans to have pheromones,
p68
aVtell you about some of the confusions in pheromones,
p69
aVand then finally, I want to end with
p70
aVa promising avenue which shows us
p71
aVthe way we ought to be going.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo the ancient Greeks knew
p74
aVthat dogs sent invisible signals between each other.
p75
aVA female dog in heat
p76
aVsent an invisible signal to male dogs
p77
aVfor miles around,
p78
aVand it wasn't a sound, it was a smell.
p79
aVYou could take the smell from the female dog,
p80
aVand the dogs would chase the cloth.
p81
aVBut the problem for everybody
p82
aVwho could see this effect
p83
aVwas that you couldn't identify the molecules.
p84
aVYou couldn't demonstrate it was chemical.
p85
aVThe reason for that, of course,
p86
aVis that each of these animals
p87
aVproduces tiny quantities,
p88
aVand in the case of the dog,
p89
aVmales dogs can smell it, but we can't smell it.
p90
aVAnd it was only in 1959 that a German team,
p91
aVafter spending 20 years in search of these molecules,
p92
aVdiscovered, identified, the first pheromone,
p93
aVand this was the sex pheromone of a silk moth.
p94
aVNow, this was an inspired choice  by Adolf Butenandt and his team,
p95
aVbecause he needed half a million moths
p96
aVto get enough material to do the chemical analysis.
p97
aVBut he created the model
p98
aVfor how you should go about pheromone analysis.
p99
aVHe basically went through systematically,
p100
aVshowing that only the molecule in question
p101
aVwas the one that stimulated the males,
p102
aVnot all the others.
p103
aVHe analyzed it very carefully.
p104
aVHe synthesized the molecule,
p105
aVand then tried the synthesized molecule on the males
p106
aVand got them to respond and showed it was,
p107
aVindeed, that molecule.
p108
aVThat's closing the circle.
p109
aVThat's the thing which has never been done with humans:
p110
aVnothing systematic, no real demonstration.
p111
aa(lp112
VWith that new concept,
p113
aVwe needed a new word,
p114
aVand that was the word "pheromone,"
p115
aVand it's basically transferred excitement,
p116
aVtransferred between individuals,
p117
aVand since 1959, pheromones have been found
p118
aVright the way across the animal kingdom,
p119
aVin male animals, in female animals.
p120
aVIt works just as well underwater
p121
aVfor goldfish and lobsters.
p122
aVAnd almost every mammal you can think of
p123
aVhas had a pheromone identified,
p124
aVand of course, an enormous number of insects.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo we know that pheromones exist
p127
aVright the way across the animal kingdom.
p128
aVWhat about humans?
p129
aVWell, the first thing, of course,
p130
aVis that we're mammals,
p131
aVand mammals are smelly.
p132
aVAs any dog owner can tell you,
p133
aVwe smell, they smell.
p134
aa(lp135
VBut the real reason we might think
p136
aVthat humans have pheromones
p137
aVis the change that occurs as we grow up.
p138
aVThe smell of a room of teenagers
p139
aVis quite different
p140
aVfrom the smell of a room of small children.
p141
aVWhat's changed? And of course, it's puberty.
p142
aVAlong with the pubic hair
p143
aVand the hair in the armpits,
p144
aVnew glands start to secrete in those places,
p145
aVand that's what's making the change in smell.
p146
aVIf we were any other kind of mammal,
p147
aVor any other kind of animal,
p148
aVwe would say,
p149
aV"That must be something to do with pheromones,"
p150
aVand we'd start looking properly.
p151
aa(lp152
VBut there are some problems, and this is why,
p153
aVI think, people have not looked for
p154
aVpheromones so effectively in humans.
p155
aVThere are, indeed, problems.
p156
aVAnd the first of these
p157
aVis perhaps surprising.
p158
aVIt's all about culture.
p159
aVNow moths don't learn a lot
p160
aVabout what is good to smell, but humans do,
p161
aVand up to the age of about four,
p162
aVany smell, no matter how rancid,
p163
aVis simply interesting.
p164
aVAnd I understand that the major role of parents
p165
aVis to stop kids putting their fingers in poo,
p166
aVbecause it's always something nice to smell.
p167
aVBut gradually we learn what's not good,
p168
aVand one of the things we learn
p169
aVat the same time as what is not good
p170
aVis what is good.
p171
aa(lp172
VNow, the cheese behind me
p173
aVis a British, if not an English, delicacy.
p174
aVIt's ripe blue Stilton.
p175
aVLiking it is incomprehensible to people from other countries.
p176
aVEvery culture has its own special food
p177
aVand national delicacy.
p178
aVIf you were to come from Iceland,
p179
aVyour national dish
p180
aVis deep rotted shark.
p181
aVNow, all of these things are acquired tastes,
p182
aVbut they form almost a badge of identity.
p183
aVYou're part of the in-group.
p184
aa(lp185
VThe second thing is the sense of smell.
p186
aVEach of us has a unique odor world,
p187
aVin the sense that what we smell,
p188
aVwe each smell a completely different world.
p189
aVNow, smell was the hardest
p190
aVof the senses to crack,
p191
aVand the Nobel Prize awarded to
p192
aVRichard Axel and Linda Buck
p193
aVwas only awarded in 2004
p194
aVfor their discovery of how smell works.
p195
aVIt's really hard,
p196
aVbut in essence, nerves from the brain
p197
aVgo up into the nose
p198
aVand on these nerves exposed in the nose
p199
aVto the outside air are receptors,
p200
aVand odor molecules coming in on a sniff
p201
aVinteract with these receptors,
p202
aVand if they bond, they send the nerve a signal
p203
aVwhich goes back into the brain.
p204
aVWe don't just have one kind of receptor.
p205
aVIf you're a human, you have about 400
p206
aVdifferent kinds of receptors,
p207
aVand the brain knows what you're smelling
p208
aVbecause of the combination of receptors
p209
aVand nerve cells that they trigger,
p210
aVsending messages up to the brain
p211
aVin a combinatorial fashion.
p212
aVBut it's a bit more complicated,
p213
aVbecause each of those 400
p214
aVcomes in various variants,
p215
aVand depending which variant you have,
p216
aVyou might smell coriander, or cilantro, that herb,
p217
aVeither as something delicious and savory
p218
aVor something like soap.
p219
aVSo we each have an individual world of smell,
p220
aVand that complicates anything
p221
aVwhen we're studying smell.
p222
aa(lp223
VWell, we really ought to talk about armpits,
p224
aVand I have to say that I do have particularly good ones.
p225
aVNow, I'm not going to share them with you,
p226
aVbut this is the place that most people
p227
aVhave looked for pheromones.
p228
aVThere is one good reason,
p229
aVwhich is, the great apes have armpits
p230
aVas their unique characteristic.
p231
aVThe other primates have scent glands
p232
aVin other parts of the body.
p233
aVThe great apes have these armpits
p234
aVfull of secretory glands
p235
aVproducing smells all the time,
p236
aVenormous numbers of molecules.
p237
aVWhen they're secreted from the glands,
p238
aVthe molecules are odorless.
p239
aVThey have no smell at all,
p240
aVand it's only the wonderful bacteria
p241
aVgrowing on the rainforest of hair
p242
aVthat actually produces the smells
p243
aVthat we know and love.
p244
aVAnd so incidentally, if you want to reduce
p245
aVthe amount of smell,
p246
aVclear-cutting your armpits
p247
aVis a very effective way of reducing
p248
aVthe habitat for bacteria,
p249
aVand you'll find they remain less smelly
p250
aVfor much longer.
p251
aVBut although we've focused on armpits,
p252
aVI think it's partly because they're the least
p253
aVembarrassing place to go and ask people for samples.
p254
aVThere is actually another reason why we might not
p255
aVbe looking for a universal sex pheromone there,
p256
aVand that's because 20 percent of the world's population
p257
aVdoesn't have smelly armpits like me.
p258
aVAnd these are people from China, Japan,
p259
aVKorea, and other parts of northeast Asia.
p260
aVThey simply don't secrete those odorless precursors
p261
aVthat the bacteria love to use to produce the smells
p262
aVthat in an ethnocentric way we always thought of
p263
aVas characteristic of armpits.
p264
aVSo it doesn't apply to 20 percent of the world.
p265
aa(lp266
VSo what should we be doing
p267
aVin our search for human pheromones?
p268
aVI'm fairly convinced that we do have them.
p269
aVWe're mammals, like everybody else
p270
aVwho's a mammal, and we probably do have them.
p271
aVBut what I think we should do
p272
aVis go right back to the beginning,
p273
aVand basically look all over the body.
p274
aVNo matter how embarrassing,
p275
aVwe need to search and go for the first time
p276
aVwhere no one else has dared tread.
p277
aVIt's going to be difficult,
p278
aVit's going to be embarrassing, but we need to look.
p279
aVWe also need to go back to the ideas
p280
aVthat Butenandt used when he was studying the silk moth.
p281
aVWe need to go back and look systematically
p282
aVat all the molecules that are being produced,
p283
aVand work out which ones are really involved.
p284
aVIt isn't good enough simply to pluck a couple
p285
aVand say, "They'll do."
p286
aVWe have to actually demonstrate
p287
aVthat they really have the effects we claim.
p288
aa(lp289
VThere is one team that I'm actually very impressed by.
p290
aVThey're in France, and their previous success
p291
aVwas identifying the rabbit mammary pheromone.
p292
aVThey've turned their attention now
p293
aVto human babies and mothers.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo this is a baby having a drink of milk
p296
aVfrom its mother's breast.
p297
aVHer nipple is completely hidden
p298
aVby the baby's head,
p299
aVbut what you'll notice is a white droplet
p300
aVwith an arrow pointing to it,
p301
aVand that's the secretion from the areolar glands.
p302
aVNow, we all have them, men and women,
p303
aVand these are the little bumps around the nipple,
p304
aVand if you're a lactating woman,
p305
aVthese start to secrete.
p306
aVIt's a very interesting secretion.
p307
aVWhat Benoist Schaal and his team developed
p308
aVwas a simple test to investigate
p309
aVwhat the effect of this secretion might be,
p310
aVin effect, a simple bioassay.
p311
aVSo this is a sleeping baby,
p312
aVand under its nose, we've put a clean glass rod.
p313
aVThe baby remains sleeping,
p314
aVshowing no interest at all.
p315
aVBut if we go to any mother
p316
aVwho is secreting from the areolar glands,
p317
aVso it's not about recognition,
p318
aVit can be from any mother,
p319
aVif we take the secretion
p320
aVand now put it under the baby's nose,
p321
aVwe get a very different reaction.
p322
aVIt's a connoisseur's reaction of delight,
p323
aVand it opens its mouth
p324
aVand sticks out its tongue
p325
aVand starts to suck.
p326
aVNow, since this is from any mother,
p327
aVit could really be a pheromone.
p328
aVIt's not about individual recognition.
p329
aVAny mother will do.
p330
aa(lp331
VNow, why is this important,
p332
aVapart from being simply very interesting?
p333
aVIt's because women vary
p334
aVin the number of areolar glands that they have,
p335
aVand there is a correlation between the ease
p336
aVwith which babies start to suckle
p337
aVand the number of areolar glands she has.
p338
aVIt appears that the more secretions she's got,
p339
aVthe more likely the baby is to suckle quickly.
p340
aVIf you're a mammal,
p341
aVthe most dangerous time in life
p342
aVis the first few hours after birth.
p343
aVYou have to get that first drink of milk,
p344
aVand if you don't get it, you won't survive.
p345
aVYou'll be dead.
p346
aVSince many babies actually find it difficult
p347
aVto take that first meal,
p348
aVbecause they're not getting the right stimulus,
p349
aVif we could identify what that molecule was,
p350
aVand the French team are being very cautious,
p351
aVbut if we could identify the molecule,
p352
aVsynthesize it, it would then mean
p353
aVpremature babies would be more likely to suckle,
p354
aVand every baby would have a better chance
p355
aVof survival.
p356
aVSo what I want to argue is this is one example
p357
aVof where a systematic, really scientific approach
p358
aVcan actually bring you a real understanding
p359
aVof pheromones.
p360
aVThere could be all sorts of medical interventions.
p361
aVThere could be all sorts of things
p362
aVthat humans are doing with pheromones
p363
aVthat we simply don't know at the moment.
p364
aVWhat we need to remember is pheromones
p365
aVare not just about sex.
p366
aVThey're about all sorts of things to do
p367
aVwith a mammal's life.
p368
aVSo do go forward and do search for more.
p369
aVThere's lots to find.
p370
aa(lp371
VThank you very much.

VI'm going to speak
p5
aVabout a tiny, little idea.
p6
aVAnd this is about shifting baseline.
p7
aVAnd because the idea can be explained in one minute,
p8
aVI will tell you three stories before
p9
aVto fill in the time.
p10
aVAnd the first story
p11
aVis about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
p12
aVAnd he was here, as you well know, in '35.
p13
aVAnd you'd think he was chasing finches,
p14
aVbut he wasn't.
p15
aVHe was actually collecting fish.
p16
aVAnd he described one of them
p17
aVas very "common."
p18
aVThis was the sailfin grouper.
p19
aVA big fishery was run on it
p20
aVuntil the '80s.
p21
aVNow the fish is on the IUCN Red List.
p22
aVNow this story,
p23
aVwe have heard it lots of times
p24
aVon Galapagos and other places,
p25
aVso there is nothing particular about it.
p26
aVBut the point is, we still come to Galapagos.
p27
aVWe still think it is pristine.
p28
aVThe brochures still say
p29
aVit is untouched.
p30
aVSo what happens here?
p31
aa(lp32
VThe second story, also to illustrate another concept,
p33
aVis called shifting waistline.
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aVBecause I was there in '71,
p36
aVstudying a lagoon in West Africa.
p37
aVI was there because I grew up in Europe
p38
aVand I wanted later to work in Africa.
p39
aVAnd I thought I could blend in.
p40
aVAnd I got a big sunburn,
p41
aVand I was convinced that I was really not from there.
p42
aVThis was my first sunburn.
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd the lagoon
p45
aVwas surrounded by palm trees,
p46
aVas you can see, and a few mangrove.
p47
aVAnd it had tilapia
p48
aVabout 20 centimeters,
p49
aVa species of tilapia called blackchin tilapia.
p50
aVAnd the fisheries for this tilapia
p51
aVsustained lots of fish and they had a good time
p52
aVand they earned more than average
p53
aVin Ghana.
p54
aVWhen I went there 27 years later,
p55
aVthe fish had shrunk to half of their size.
p56
aVThey were maturing at five centimeters.
p57
aVThey had been pushed genetically.
p58
aVThere were still fishes.
p59
aVThey were still kind of happy.
p60
aVAnd the fish also were happy to be there.
p61
aVSo nothing has changed,
p62
aVbut everything has changed.
p63
aa(lp64
VMy third little story
p65
aVis that I was an accomplice
p66
aVin the introduction of trawling
p67
aVin Southeast Asia.
p68
aVIn the '70s \u2014 well, beginning in the '60s \u2014
p69
aVEurope did lots of development projects.
p70
aVFish development
p71
aVmeant imposing on countries
p72
aVthat had already 100,000 fishers
p73
aVto impose on them industrial fishing.
p74
aVAnd this boat, quite ugly,
p75
aVis called the Mutiara 4.
p76
aVAnd I went sailing on it,
p77
aVand we did surveys
p78
aVthroughout the southern South China sea
p79
aVand especially the Java Sea.
p80
aVAnd what we caught,
p81
aVwe didn't have words for it.
p82
aVWhat we caught, I know now,
p83
aVis the bottom of the sea.
p84
aVAnd 90 percent of our catch
p85
aVwere sponges,
p86
aVother animals that are fixed on the bottom.
p87
aVAnd actually most of the fish,
p88
aVthey are a little spot on the debris,
p89
aVthe piles of debris, were coral reef fish.
p90
aVEssentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck
p91
aVand then was thrown down.
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd these pictures are extraordinary
p94
aVbecause this transition is very rapid.
p95
aVWithin a year, you do a survey
p96
aVand then commercial fishing begins.
p97
aVThe bottom is transformed
p98
aVfrom, in this case, a hard bottom or soft coral
p99
aVinto a muddy mess.
p100
aVThis is a dead turtle.
p101
aVThey were not eaten, they were thrown away because they were dead.
p102
aVAnd one time we caught a live one.
p103
aVIt was not drowned yet.
p104
aVAnd then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat.
p105
aVThis mountain of debris
p106
aVis actually collected by fishers
p107
aVevery time they go
p108
aVinto an area that's never been fished.
p109
aVBut it's not documented.
p110
aa(lp111
VWe transform the world,
p112
aVbut we don't remember it.
p113
aVWe adjust our baseline
p114
aVto the new level,
p115
aVand we don't recall what was there.
p116
aVIf you generalize this,
p117
aVsomething like this happens.
p118
aVYou have on the y axis some good thing:
p119
aVbiodiversity, numbers of orca,
p120
aVthe greenness of your country, the water supply.
p121
aVAnd over time it changes \u2014
p122
aVit changes
p123
aVbecause people do things, or naturally.
p124
aVEvery generation
p125
aVwill use the images
p126
aVthat they got at the beginning of their conscious lives
p127
aVas a standard
p128
aVand will extrapolate forward.
p129
aVAnd the difference then,
p130
aVthey perceive as a loss.
p131
aVBut they don't perceive what happened before as a loss.
p132
aVYou can have a succession of changes.
p133
aVAt the end you want to sustain
p134
aVmiserable leftovers.
p135
aVAnd that, to a large extent, is what we want to do now.
p136
aVWe want to sustain things that are gone
p137
aVor things that are not the way they were.
p138
aa(lp139
VNow one should think
p140
aVthis problem affected people
p141
aVcertainly when in predatory societies,
p142
aVthey killed animals
p143
aVand they didn't know they had done so
p144
aVafter a few generations.
p145
aVBecause, obviously,
p146
aVan animal that is very abundant,
p147
aVbefore it gets extinct,
p148
aVit becomes rare.
p149
aVSo you don't lose abundant animals.
p150
aVYou always lose rare animals.
p151
aVAnd therefore they're not perceived
p152
aVas a big loss.
p153
aVOver time,
p154
aVwe concentrate on large animals,
p155
aVand in a sea that means the big fish.
p156
aVThey become rarer because we fish them.
p157
aVOver time we have a few fish left
p158
aVand we think this is the baseline.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd the question is,
p161
aVwhy do people accept this?
p162
aVWell because they don't know that it was different.
p163
aVAnd in fact, lots of people, scientists,
p164
aVwill contest that it was really different.
p165
aVAnd they will contest this
p166
aVbecause the evidence
p167
aVpresented in an earlier mode
p168
aVis not in the way
p169
aVthey would like the evidence presented.
p170
aVFor example,
p171
aVthe anecdote that some present,
p172
aVas Captain so-and-so
p173
aVobserved lots of fish in this area
p174
aVcannot be used
p175
aVor is usually not utilized by fishery scientists,
p176
aVbecause it's not "scientific."
p177
aVSo you have a situation
p178
aVwhere people don't know the past,
p179
aVeven though we live in literate societies,
p180
aVbecause they don't trust
p181
aVthe sources of the past.
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd hence, the enormous role
p184
aVthat a marine protected area can play.
p185
aVBecause with marine protected areas,
p186
aVwe actually recreate the past.
p187
aVWe recreate the past that people cannot conceive
p188
aVbecause the baseline has shifted
p189
aVand is extremely low.
p190
aVThat is for people
p191
aVwho can see a marine protected area
p192
aVand who can benefit
p193
aVfrom the insight that it provides,
p194
aVwhich enables them to reset their baseline.
p195
aa(lp196
VHow about the people who can't do that
p197
aVbecause they have no access \u2014
p198
aVthe people in the Midwest for example?
p199
aVThere I think
p200
aVthat the arts and film
p201
aVcan perhaps fill the gap,
p202
aVand simulation.
p203
aVThis is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay.
p204
aVThere were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay a long time ago \u2014
p205
aV500 years ago.
p206
aVAnd you will have noticed that the hues and tones
p207
aVare like "Avatar."
p208
aV(Laughter)
p209
aVAnd if you think about "Avatar,"
p210
aVif you think of why people were so touched by it \u2014
p211
aVnever mind the Pocahontas story \u2014
p212
aVwhy so touched by the imagery?
p213
aVBecause it evokes something
p214
aVthat in a sense has been lost.
p215
aVAnd so my recommendation,
p216
aVit's the only one I will provide,
p217
aVis for Cameron to do "Avatar II" underwater.
p218
aa(lp219
VThank you very much.

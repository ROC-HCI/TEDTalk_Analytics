VYou may be wondering
p5
aVwhy a marine biologist from Oceana
p6
aVwould come here today to talk to you
p7
aVabout world hunger.
p8
aVI'm here today because
p9
aVsaving the oceans is more than an ecological desire.
p10
aVIt's more than a thing we're doing
p11
aVbecause we want to create jobs for fishermen
p12
aVor preserve fishermen's jobs.
p13
aVIt's more than an economic pursuit.
p14
aVSaving the oceans can feed the world.
p15
aVLet me show you how.
p16
aa(lp17
VAs you know, there are already
p18
aVmore than a billion hungry people on this planet.
p19
aVWe're expecting that problem to get worse
p20
aVas world population grows to nine billion
p21
aVor 10 billion by midcentury,
p22
aVand we can expect to have greater pressure
p23
aVon our food resources.
p24
aVAnd this is a big concern,
p25
aVespecially considering where we are now.
p26
aVNow we know that our arable land per capita
p27
aVis already on the decline
p28
aVin both developed and developing countries.
p29
aVWe know that we're headed for climate change,
p30
aVwhich is going to change rainfall patterns,
p31
aVmaking some areas drier, as you can see in orange,
p32
aVand others wetter, in blue,
p33
aVcausing droughts in our breadbaskets,
p34
aVin places like the Midwest and Central Europe,
p35
aVand floods in others.
p36
aVIt's going to make it harder for the land
p37
aVto help us solve the hunger problem.
p38
aVAnd that's why the oceans need to be their most abundant,
p39
aVso that the oceans can provide us
p40
aVas much food as possible.
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd that's something the oceans have been doing
p43
aVfor us for a long time.
p44
aVAs far back as we can go, we've seen an increase
p45
aVin the amount of food we've been able to harvest
p46
aVfrom our oceans.
p47
aVIt just seemed like it was continuing to increase,
p48
aVuntil about 1980,
p49
aVwhen we started to see a decline.
p50
aVYou've heard of peak oil.
p51
aVMaybe this is peak fish.
p52
aVI hope not. I'm going to come back to that.
p53
aVBut you can see about an 18-percent decline
p54
aVin the amount of fish we've gotten in our world catch
p55
aVsince 1980.
p56
aVAnd this is a big problem. It's continuing.
p57
aVThis red line is continuing to go down.
p58
aa(lp59
VBut we know how to turn it around,
p60
aVand that's what I'm going to talk about today.
p61
aVWe know how to turn that curve back upwards.
p62
aVThis doesn't have to be peak fish.
p63
aVIf we do a few simple things in targeted places,
p64
aVwe can bring our fisheries back and use them
p65
aVto feed people.
p66
aa(lp67
VFirst we want to know where the fish are,
p68
aVso let's look where the fish are.
p69
aVIt turns out the fish, conveniently,
p70
aVare located for the most part
p71
aVin our coastal areas of the countries,
p72
aVin coastal zones,
p73
aVand these are areas that national jurisdictions
p74
aVhave control over,
p75
aVand they can manage their fisheries
p76
aVin these coastal areas.
p77
aVCoastal countries tend to have jurisdictions
p78
aVthat go out about 200 nautical miles,
p79
aVin areas that are called exclusive economic zones,
p80
aVand this is a good thing that they can control
p81
aVtheir fisheries in these areas,
p82
aVbecause the high seas,
p83
aVwhich are the darker areas on this map,
p84
aVthe high seas, it's a lot harder to control things,
p85
aVbecause it has to be done internationally.
p86
aVYou get into international agreements,
p87
aVand if any of you are tracking the climate change agreement,
p88
aVyou know this can be a very slow,
p89
aVfrustrating, tedious process.
p90
aVAnd so controlling things nationally
p91
aVis a great thing to be able to do.
p92
aa(lp93
VHow many fish are actually in these coastal areas
p94
aVcompared to the high seas?
p95
aVWell, you can see here about
p96
aVseven times as many fish in the coastal areas
p97
aVthan there are in the high seas,
p98
aVso this is a perfect place for us to be focusing,
p99
aVbecause we can actually get a lot done.
p100
aVWe can restore a lot of our fisheries
p101
aVif we focus in these coastal areas.
p102
aa(lp103
VBut how many of these countries do we have to work in?
p104
aVThere's something like 80 coastal countries.
p105
aVDo we have to fix fisheries management
p106
aVin all of those countries?
p107
aVSo we asked ourselves, how many countries
p108
aVdo we need to focus on,
p109
aVkeeping in mind that the European Union
p110
aVconveniently manages its fisheries
p111
aVthrough a common fisheries policy?
p112
aVSo if we got good fisheries management
p113
aVin the European Union and, say, nine other countries,
p114
aVhow much of our fisheries would we be covering?
p115
aVTurns out, European Union plus nine countries
p116
aVcovers about two thirds of the world's fish catch.
p117
aVIf we took it up to 24 countries plus the European Union,
p118
aVwe would up to 90 percent,
p119
aValmost all of the world's fish catch.
p120
aVSo we think we can work in a limited number of places
p121
aVto make the fisheries come back.
p122
aVBut what do we have to do in these places?
p123
aVWell, based on our work in the United States
p124
aVand elsewhere, we know that there are
p125
aVthree key things we have to do
p126
aVto bring fisheries back, and they are:
p127
aVWe need to set quotas or limits
p128
aVon how much we take;
p129
aVwe need to reduce bycatch, which is the accidental
p130
aVcatching and killing of fish that we're not targeting,
p131
aVand it's very wasteful;
p132
aVand three, we need to protect habitats,
p133
aVthe nursery areas, the spawning areas
p134
aVthat these fish need to grow and reproduce successfully
p135
aVso that they can rebuild their populations.
p136
aVIf we do those three things, we  know the fisheries will come back.
p137
aa(lp138
VHow do we know?
p139
aVWe know because we've seen it happening
p140
aVin a lot of different places.
p141
aVThis is a slide that shows
p142
aVthe herring population in Norway
p143
aVthat was crashing since the 1950s.
p144
aVIt was coming down, and when Norway set limits,
p145
aVor quotas, on its fishery, what happens?
p146
aVThe fishery comes back.
p147
aVThis is another example, also happens to be from Norway,
p148
aVof the Norwegian Arctic cod.
p149
aVSame deal. The fishery is crashing.
p150
aVThey set limits on discards.
p151
aVDiscards are these fish they weren't targeting
p152
aVand they get thrown overboard wastefully.
p153
aVWhen they set the discard limit,
p154
aVthe fishery came back.
p155
aVAnd it's not just in Norway.
p156
aVWe've seen this happening in countries
p157
aVall around the world, time and time again.
p158
aVWhen these countries step in and they
p159
aVput in sustainable fisheries management policies,
p160
aVthe fisheries, which are always crashing, it seems,
p161
aVare starting to come back.
p162
aVSo there's a lot of promise here.
p163
aa(lp164
VWhat does this mean for the world fish catch?
p165
aVThis means that if we take that fishery catch
p166
aVthat's on the decline
p167
aVand we could turn it upwards, we could increase it
p168
aVup to 100 million metric tons per year.
p169
aVSo we didn't have peak fish yet.
p170
aVWe still have an opportunity
p171
aVto not only bring the fish back
p172
aVbut to actually get more fish
p173
aVthat can feed more people
p174
aVthan we currently are now.
p175
aVHow many more? Right about now,
p176
aVwe can feed about 450 million people
p177
aVa fish meal a day
p178
aVbased on the current world fish catch,
p179
aVwhich, of course, you know is going down,
p180
aVso that number will go down over time
p181
aVif we don't fix it,
p182
aVbut if we put fishery management practices
p183
aVlike the ones I've described in place
p184
aVin 10 to 25 countries,
p185
aVwe could bring that number up
p186
aVand feed as many as 700 million people a year
p187
aVa healthy fish meal.
p188
aa(lp189
VWe should obviously do this just because
p190
aVit's a good thing to deal with the hunger problem,
p191
aVbut it's also cost-effective.
p192
aVIt turns out fish is the most cost-effective protein
p193
aVon the planet.
p194
aVIf you look at how much fish protein you get
p195
aVper dollar invested
p196
aVcompared to all of the other animal proteins,
p197
aVobviously, fish is a good business decision.
p198
aVIt also doesn't need a lot of land,
p199
aVsomething that's in short supply,
p200
aVcompared to other protein sources.
p201
aVAnd it doesn't need a lot of fresh water.
p202
aVIt uses a lot less fresh water than,
p203
aVfor example, cattle,
p204
aVwhere you have to irrigate a field
p205
aVso that you can grow the food to graze the cattle.
p206
aVIt also has a very low carbon footprint.
p207
aVIt has a little bit of a carbon footprint
p208
aVbecause we do have to get out and catch the fish.
p209
aVIt takes a little bit of fuel,
p210
aVbut as you know, agriculture can have a carbon footprint,
p211
aVand fish has a much smaller one,
p212
aVso it's less polluting.
p213
aVIt's already a big part of our diet,
p214
aVbut it can be a bigger part of our diet,
p215
aVwhich is a good thing, because we know
p216
aVthat it's healthy for us.
p217
aVIt can reduce our risks of cancer,
p218
aVheart disease and obesity.
p219
aVIn fact, our CEO Andy Sharpless,
p220
aVwho is the originator of this concept, actually,
p221
aVhe likes to say fish is the perfect protein.
p222
aVAndy also talks about the fact that
p223
aVour ocean conservation movement really grew
p224
aVout of the land conservation movement,
p225
aVand in land conservation,
p226
aVwe have this problem where biodiversity
p227
aVis at war with food production.
p228
aVYou have to cut down the biodiverse forest
p229
aVif you want to get the field
p230
aVto grow the corn to feed people with,
p231
aVand so there's a constant push-pull there.
p232
aVThere's a constant tough decision
p233
aVthat has to be made between
p234
aVtwo very important things:
p235
aVmaintaining biodiversity and feeding people.
p236
aVBut in the oceans, we don't have that war.
p237
aVIn the oceans, biodiversity is not at war
p238
aVwith abundance.
p239
aVIn fact, they're aligned.
p240
aVWhen we do things that produce biodiversity,
p241
aVwe actually get more abundance,
p242
aVand that's important so that we can feed people.
p243
aa(lp244
VNow, there's a catch.
p245
aa(lp246
VDidn't anyone get that? (Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
VIllegal fishing.
p249
aVIllegal fishing undermines the type of
p250
aVsustainable fisheries management I'm talking about.
p251
aVIt can be when you catch fish using gears
p252
aVthat have been prohibited,
p253
aVwhen you fish in places where you're not supposed to fish,
p254
aVyou catch fish that are the wrong size or the wrong species.
p255
aVIllegal fishing cheats the consumer
p256
aVand it also cheats honest fishermen,
p257
aVand it needs to stop.
p258
aVThe way illegal fish get into our  market is through seafood fraud.
p259
aVYou might have heard about this.
p260
aVIt's when fish are labeled as something they're not.
p261
aVThink about the last time you had fish.
p262
aVWhat were you eating?
p263
aVAre you sure that's what it was?
p264
aVBecause we tested 1,300 different fish samples
p265
aVand about a third of them
p266
aVwere not what they were labeled to be.
p267
aVSnappers, nine out of 10 snappers were not snapper.
p268
aVFifty-nine percent of the tuna we tested
p269
aVwas mislabeled.
p270
aVAnd red snapper, we tested 120 samples,
p271
aVand only seven of them were really red snapper,
p272
aVso good luck finding a red snapper.
p273
aa(lp274
VSeafood has a really complex supply chain,
p275
aVand at every step in this supply chain,
p276
aVthere's an opportunity for seafood fraud,
p277
aVunless we have traceability.
p278
aVTraceability is a way where the seafood industry
p279
aVcan track the seafood from the boat to the plate
p280
aVto make sure that the consumer can then find out
p281
aVwhere their seafood came from.
p282
aa(lp283
VThis is a really important thing.
p284
aVIt's being done by some in the industry, but not enough,
p285
aVso we're pushing a law in Congress
p286
aVcalled the SAFE Seafood Act,
p287
aVand I'm very excited today to announce the release
p288
aVof a chef's petition, where 450 chefs
p289
aVhave signed a petition calling on Congress
p290
aVto support the SAFE Seafood Act.
p291
aVIt has a lot of celebrity chefs you may know \u2014
p292
aVAnthony Bourdain, Mario Batali,
p293
aVBarton Seaver and others \u2014
p294
aVand they've signed it because they believe
p295
aVthat people have a right to know
p296
aVabout what they're eating.
p297
aa(lp298
V(Applause)
p299
aa(lp300
VFishermen like it too, so there's a good chance
p301
aVwe can get the kind of support we need
p302
aVto get this bill through,
p303
aVand it comes at a critical time,
p304
aVbecause this is the way we stop seafood fraud,
p305
aVthis is the way we curb illegal fishing,
p306
aVand this is the way we make sure
p307
aVthat quotas, habitat protection,
p308
aVand bycatch reductions can do the jobs
p309
aVthey can do.
p310
aa(lp311
VWe know that we can manage our fisheries sustainably.
p312
aVWe know that we can produce
p313
aVhealthy meals for hundreds of millions of people
p314
aVthat don't use the land, that don't use much water,
p315
aVhave a low carbon footprint,
p316
aVand are cost-effective.
p317
aVWe know that saving the oceans
p318
aVcan feed the world,
p319
aVand we need to start now.
p320
aa(lp321
V(Applause)
p322
aa(lp323
VThank you. (Applause)

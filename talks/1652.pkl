VSo I want to talk to you about two things tonight.
p5
aVNumber one:
p6
aVTeaching surgery and doing surgery
p7
aVis really hard.
p8
aVAnd second,
p9
aVthat language is one of the most profound things
p10
aVthat separate us all over the world.
p11
aVAnd in my little corner of the world,
p12
aVthese two things are actually related,
p13
aVand I want to tell you how tonight.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow, nobody wants an operation.
p16
aVWho here has had surgery?
p17
aVDid you want it?
p18
aVKeep your hands up if you wanted an operation.
p19
aVNobody wants an operation.
p20
aVIn particular, nobody wants an operation
p21
aVwith tools like these through large incisions
p22
aVthat cause a lot of pain,
p23
aVthat cause a lot of time out of work or out of school,
p24
aVthat leave a big scar.
p25
aVBut if you have to have an operation,
p26
aVwhat you really want is a minimally invasive operation.
p27
aVThat's what I want to talk to you about tonight \u2014
p28
aVhow doing and teaching this type of surgery
p29
aVled us on a search
p30
aVfor a better universal translator.
p31
aa(lp32
VNow, this type of surgery is hard,
p33
aVand it starts by putting people to sleep,
p34
aVputting carbon dioxide in their abdomen,
p35
aVblowing them up like a balloon,
p36
aVsticking one of these sharp pointy things into their abdomen \u2014
p37
aVit's dangerous stuff \u2014
p38
aVand taking instruments and watching it on a TV screen.
p39
aVSo let's see what it looks like.
p40
aVSo this is gallbladder surgery.
p41
aVWe perform a million of these a year
p42
aVin the United States alone.
p43
aVThis is the real thing. There's no blood.
p44
aVAnd you can see how focused the surgeons are,
p45
aVhow much concentration it takes.
p46
aVYou can see it in their faces.
p47
aVIt's hard to teach, and it's not all that easy to learn.
p48
aVWe do about five million of these in the United States
p49
aVand maybe 20 million of these worldwide.
p50
aa(lp51
VAll right, you've all heard the term:
p52
aV"He's a born surgeon."
p53
aVLet me tell you, surgeons are not born.
p54
aVSurgeons are not made either.
p55
aVThere are no little tanks where we're making surgeons.
p56
aVSurgeons are trained one step at a time.
p57
aVIt starts with a foundation, basic skills.
p58
aVWe build on that and we take people, hopefully, to the operating room
p59
aVwhere they learn to be an assistant.
p60
aVThen we teach them to be a surgeon in training.
p61
aVAnd when they do all of that for about five years,
p62
aVthey get the coveted board certification.
p63
aVIf you need surgery, you want to be operated on
p64
aVby a board-certified surgeon.
p65
aVYou get your board certificate,
p66
aVand you can go out into practice.
p67
aVAnd eventually, if you're lucky, you achieve mastery.
p68
aa(lp69
VNow that foundation is so important
p70
aVthat a number of us
p71
aVfrom the largest general surgery society in the United States, SAGES,
p72
aVstarted in the late 1990s a training program
p73
aVthat would assure that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery
p74
aVwould have a strong foundation of knowledge and skills
p75
aVnecessary to go on and do procedures.
p76
aVNow the science behind this is so potent
p77
aVthat it became required by the American Board of Surgery
p78
aVin order for a young surgeon to become board certified.
p79
aVIt's not a lecture, it's not a course,
p80
aVit's all of that plus a high-stakes assessment.
p81
aVIt's hard.
p82
aVNow just this past year,
p83
aVone of our partners, the American College of Surgeons,
p84
aVteamed up with us to make an announcement
p85
aVthat all surgeons should be FLS (Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery)-certified
p86
aVbefore they do minimally invasive surgery.
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd are we talking about just people here in the U.S. and Canada?
p89
aVNo, we just said all surgeons.
p90
aVSo to lift this education and training worldwide
p91
aVis a very large task,
p92
aVsomething I'm very personally excited about as we travel around the world.
p93
aVSAGES does surgery all over the world, teaching and educating surgeons.
p94
aVSo we have a problem, and one of the problems is distance.
p95
aVWe can't travel everywhere.
p96
aVWe need to make the world a smaller place.
p97
aVAnd I think that we can develop some tools to do so.
p98
aVAnd one of the tools I like personally is using video.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo I was inspired by a friend.
p101
aVThis is Allan Okrainec from Toronto.
p102
aVAnd he proved
p103
aVthat you could actually teach people to do surgery
p104
aVusing video conferencing.
p105
aVSo here's Allan teaching an English-speaking surgeon in Africa
p106
aVthese basic fundamental skills
p107
aVnecessary to do minimally invasive surgery.
p108
aVVery inspiring.
p109
aVBut for this examination, which is really hard,
p110
aVwe have a problem.
p111
aVEven people who say they speak English,
p112
aVonly 14 percent pass.
p113
aVBecause for them it's not a surgery test,
p114
aVit's an English test.
p115
aa(lp116
VLet me bring it to you locally.
p117
aVI work at the Cambridge Hospital.
p118
aVIt's the primary Harvard Medical School teaching facility.
p119
aVWe have more than 100 translators covering 63 languages,
p120
aVand we spend millions of dollars just in our little hospital.
p121
aVIt's a big labor-intensive effort.
p122
aVIf you think about the worldwide burden
p123
aVof trying to talk to your patients \u2014
p124
aVnot just teaching surgeons, just trying to talk to your patients \u2014
p125
aVthere aren't enough translators in the world.
p126
aVWe need to employ technology to assist us in this quest.
p127
aVAt our hospital we see everybody from Harvard professors
p128
aVto people who just got here last week.
p129
aVAnd you have no idea how hard it is
p130
aVto talk to somebody or take care of somebody you can't talk to.
p131
aVAnd there isn't always a translator available.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo we need tools.
p134
aVWe need a universal translator.
p135
aVOne of the things that I want to leave you with as you think about this talk
p136
aVis that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world.
p137
aVIt's really about setting up a dialogue.
p138
aVWe have a lot to learn.
p139
aVHere in the United States we spend more money per person
p140
aVfor outcomes that are not better than many countries in the world.
p141
aVMaybe we have something to learn as well.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo I'm passionate about teaching these FLS skills all over the world.
p144
aVThis past year I've been in Latin America, I've been in China,
p145
aVtalking about the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery.
p146
aVAnd everywhere I go the barrier is:
p147
aV"We want this, but we need it in our language."
p148
aVSo here's what we think we want to do:
p149
aVImagine giving a lecture
p150
aVand being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously.
p151
aVI want to talk to the people in Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe
p152
aVseamlessly, accurately
p153
aVand in a cost-effective fashion using technology.
p154
aVAnd it has to be bi-directional.
p155
aVThey have to be able to teach us something as well.
p156
aa(lp157
VIt's a big task.
p158
aVSo we looked for a universal translator; I thought there would be one out there.
p159
aVYour webpage has translation, your cellphone has translation,
p160
aVbut nothing that's good enough to teach surgery.
p161
aVBecause we need a lexicon. What is a lexicon?
p162
aVA lexicon is a body of words that describes a domain.
p163
aVI need to have a health care lexicon.
p164
aVAnd in that I need a surgery lexicon.
p165
aVThat's a tall order. We have to work at it.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo let me show you what we're doing.
p168
aVThis is research \u2014 can't buy it.
p169
aVWe're working with the folks at IBM Research from the Accessibility Center
p170
aVto string together technologies to work towards the universal translator.
p171
aVIt starts with a framework system
p172
aVwhere when the surgeon delivers the lecture
p173
aVusing a framework of captioning technology,
p174
aVwe then add another technology to do video conferencing.
p175
aVBut we don't have the words yet, so we add a third technology.
p176
aVAnd now we've got the words,
p177
aVand we can apply the special sauce: the translation.
p178
aVWe get the words up in a window and then apply the magic.
p179
aVWe work with a fourth technology.
p180
aVAnd we currently have access to eleven language pairs.
p181
aVMore to come as we think about trying to make the world a smaller place.
p182
aVAnd I'd like to show you our prototype
p183
aVof stringing all of these technologies that don't necessarily always talk to each other
p184
aVto become something useful.
p185
aa(lp186
VNarrator: Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery.
p187
aVModule five: manual skills practice.
p188
aVStudents may display captions in their native language.
p189
aa(lp190
VSteven Schwaitzberg: If you're in Latin America,
p191
aVyou click the "I want it in Spanish" button
p192
aVand out it comes in real time in Spanish.
p193
aVBut if you happen to be sitting in Beijing at the same time,
p194
aVby using technology in a constructive fashion,
p195
aVyou could get it in Mandarin or you could get it in Russian \u2014
p196
aVon and on and on, simultaneously without the use of human translators.
p197
aVBut that's the lectures.
p198
aa(lp199
VIf you remember what I told you about FLS at the beginning,
p200
aVit's knowledge and skills.
p201
aVThe difference in an operation
p202
aVbetween doing something successfully and not
p203
aVmay be moving your hand this much.
p204
aVSo we're going to take it one step further;
p205
aVwe've brought my friend Allan back.
p206
aa(lp207
VAllan Okrainec: Today we're going to practice suturing.
p208
aVThis is how you hold the needle.
p209
aVGrab the needle at the tip.
p210
aVIt's important to be accurate.
p211
aVAim for the black dots.
p212
aVOrient your loop this way.
p213
aVNow go ahead and cut.
p214
aVVery good Oscar. I'll see you next week.
p215
aa(lp216
VSS: So that's what we're working on
p217
aVin our quest for the universal translator.
p218
aVWe want it to be bi-directional.
p219
aVWe have a need to learn as well as to teach.
p220
aVI can think of a million uses for a tool like this.
p221
aVAs we think about intersecting technologies \u2014
p222
aVeverybody has a cell phone with a camera \u2014
p223
aVwe could use this everywhere,
p224
aVwhether it be health care, patient care,
p225
aVengineering, law, conferencing, translating videos.
p226
aVThis is a ubiquitous tool.
p227
aa(lp228
VIn order to break down our barriers,
p229
aVwe have to learn to talk to people,
p230
aVto demand that people work on translation.
p231
aVWe need it for our everyday life,
p232
aVin order to make the world a smaller place.
p233
aVThank you very much.

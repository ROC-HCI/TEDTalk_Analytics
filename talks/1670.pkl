VThe global economic financial crisis has reignited public interest
p5
aVin something that's actually one of the oldest questions in economics,
p6
aVdating back to at least before Adam Smith.
p7
aVAnd that is, why is it that countries with seemingly similar economies and institutions
p8
aVcan display radically different savings behavior?
p9
aa(lp10
VNow, many brilliant economists have spent their entire lives working on this question,
p11
aVand as a field we've made a tremendous amount of headway
p12
aVand we understand a lot about this.
p13
aVWhat I'm here to talk with you about today is an intriguing new hypothesis
p14
aVand some surprisingly powerful new findings that I've been working on
p15
aVabout the link between the structure of the language you speak
p16
aVand how you find yourself with the propensity to save.
p17
aVLet me tell you a little bit about savings rates, a little bit about language,
p18
aVand then I'll draw that connection.
p19
aa(lp20
VLet's start by thinking about the member countries of the OECD,
p21
aVor the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.
p22
aVOECD countries, by and large, you should think about these
p23
aVas the richest, most industrialized countries in the world.
p24
aVAnd by joining the OECD, they were affirming a common commitment
p25
aVto democracy, open markets and free trade.
p26
aVDespite all of these similarities, we see huge differences in savings behavior.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo all the way over on the left of this graph,
p29
aVwhat you see is many OECD countries saving over a quarter of their GDP every year,
p30
aVand some OECD countries saving over a third of their GDP per year.
p31
aVHolding down the right flank of the OECD, all the way on the other side, is Greece.
p32
aVAnd what you can see is that over the last 25 years,
p33
aVGreece has barely managed to save more than 10 percent of their GDP.
p34
aVIt should be noted, of course, that the United States and the U.K. are the next in line.
p35
aa(lp36
VNow that we see these huge differences in savings rates,
p37
aVhow is it possible that language might have something to do with these differences?
p38
aVLet me tell you a little bit about how languages fundamentally differ.
p39
aVLinguists and cognitive scientists have been exploring this question for many years now.
p40
aVAnd then I'll draw the connection between these two behaviors.
p41
aa(lp42
VMany of you have probably already noticed that I'm Chinese.
p43
aVI grew up in the Midwest of the United States.
p44
aVAnd something I realized quite early on
p45
aVwas that the Chinese language forced me to speak about and \u2014
p46
aVin fact, more fundamentally than that \u2014
p47
aVever so slightly forced me to think about family in very different ways.
p48
aa(lp49
VNow, how might that be? Let me give you an example.
p50
aVSuppose I were talking with you and I was introducing you to my uncle.
p51
aVYou understood exactly what I just said in English.
p52
aVIf we were speaking Mandarin Chinese with each other, though,
p53
aVI wouldn't have that luxury.
p54
aVI wouldn't have been able to convey so little information.
p55
aVWhat my language would have forced me to do,
p56
aVinstead of just telling you, "This is my uncle,"
p57
aVis to tell you a tremendous amount of additional information.
p58
aVMy language would force me to tell you
p59
aVwhether or not this was an uncle on my mother's side or my father's side,
p60
aVwhether this was an uncle by marriage or by birth,
p61
aVand if this man was my father's brother,
p62
aVwhether he was older than or younger than my father.
p63
aVAll of this information is obligatory. Chinese doesn't let me ignore it.
p64
aVAnd in fact, if I want to speak correctly,
p65
aVChinese forces me to constantly think about it.
p66
aa(lp67
VNow, that fascinated me endlessly as a child,
p68
aVbut what fascinates me even more today as an economist
p69
aVis that some of these same differences carry through to how languages speak about time.
p70
aVSo for example, if I'm speaking in English, I have to speak grammatically differently
p71
aVif I'm talking about past rain, "It rained yesterday,"
p72
aVcurrent rain, "It is raining now,"
p73
aVor future rain, "It will rain tomorrow."
p74
aVNotice that English requires a lot more information with respect to the timing of events.
p75
aVWhy? Because I have to consider that
p76
aVand I have to modify what I'm saying to say, "It will rain," or "It's going to rain."
p77
aVIt's simply not permissible in English to say, "It rain tomorrow."
p78
aa(lp79
VIn contrast to that, that's almost exactly what you would say in Chinese.
p80
aVA Chinese speaker can basically say something
p81
aVthat sounds very strange to an English speaker's ears.
p82
aVThey can say, "Yesterday it rain," "Now it rain," "Tomorrow it rain."
p83
aVIn some deep sense, Chinese doesn't divide up the time spectrum
p84
aVin the same way that English forces us to constantly do in order to speak correctly.
p85
aa(lp86
VIs this difference in languages
p87
aVonly between very, very distantly related languages, like English and Chinese?
p88
aVActually, no.
p89
aVSo many of you know, in this room, that English is a Germanic language.
p90
aVWhat you may not have realized is that English is actually an outlier.
p91
aVIt is the only Germanic language that requires this.
p92
aVFor example, most other Germanic language speakers
p93
aVfeel completely comfortable talking about rain tomorrow
p94
aVby saying, "Morgen regnet es,"
p95
aVquite literally to an English ear, "It rain tomorrow."
p96
aa(lp97
VThis led me, as a behavioral economist, to an intriguing hypothesis.
p98
aVCould how you speak about time, could how your language forces you to think about time,
p99
aVaffect your propensity to behave across time?
p100
aVYou speak English, a futured language.
p101
aVAnd what that means is that every time you discuss the future,
p102
aVor any kind of a future event,
p103
aVgrammatically you're forced to cleave that from the present
p104
aVand treat it as if it's something viscerally different.
p105
aVNow suppose that that visceral difference
p106
aVmakes you subtly dissociate the future from the present every time you speak.
p107
aVIf that's true and it makes the future feel
p108
aVlike something more distant and more different from the present,
p109
aVthat's going to make it harder to save.
p110
aVIf, on the other hand, you speak a futureless language,
p111
aVthe present and the future, you speak about them identically.
p112
aVIf that subtly nudges you to feel about them identically,
p113
aVthat's going to make it easier to save.
p114
aa(lp115
VNow this is a fanciful theory.
p116
aVI'm a professor, I get paid to have fanciful theories.
p117
aVBut how would you actually go about testing such a theory?
p118
aVWell, what I did with that was to access the linguistics literature.
p119
aVAnd interestingly enough, there are pockets of futureless language speakers
p120
aVsituated all over the world.
p121
aVThis is a pocket of futureless language speakers in Northern Europe.
p122
aVInterestingly enough, when you start to crank the data,
p123
aVthese pockets of futureless language speakers all around the world
p124
aVturn out to be, by and large, some of the world's best savers.
p125
aa(lp126
VJust to give you a hint of that,
p127
aVlet's look back at that OECD graph that we were talking about.
p128
aVWhat you see is that these bars are systematically taller
p129
aVand systematically shifted to the left
p130
aVcompared to these bars which are the members of the OECD that speak futured languages.
p131
aVWhat is the average difference here?
p132
aVFive percentage points of your GDP saved per year.
p133
aVOver 25 years that has huge long-run effects on the wealth of your nation.
p134
aa(lp135
VNow while these findings are suggestive,
p136
aVcountries can be different in so many different ways
p137
aVthat it's very, very difficult sometimes to account for all of these possible differences.
p138
aVWhat I'm going to show you, though, is something that I've been engaging in for a year,
p139
aVwhich is trying to gather all of the largest datasets
p140
aVthat we have access to as economists,
p141
aVand I'm going to try and strip away all of those possible differences,
p142
aVhoping to get this relationship to break.
p143
aVAnd just in summary, no matter how far I push this, I can't get it to break.
p144
aVLet me show you how far you can do that.
p145
aa(lp146
VOne way to imagine that is I gather large datasets from around the world.
p147
aVSo for example, there is the Survey of Health, [Aging] and Retirement in Europe.
p148
aVFrom this dataset you actually learn that retired European families
p149
aVare extremely patient with survey takers.
p150
aV(Laughter)
p151
aVSo imagine that you're a retired household in Belgium and someone comes to your front door.
p152
aV"Excuse me, would you mind if I peruse your stock portfolio?
p153
aVDo you happen to know how much your house is worth? Do you mind telling me?
p154
aVWould you happen to have a hallway that's more than 10 meters long?
p155
aVIf you do, would you mind if I timed how long it took you to walk down that hallway?
p156
aVWould you mind squeezing as hard as you can, in your dominant hand, this device
p157
aVso I can measure your grip strength?
p158
aVHow about blowing into this tube so I can measure your lung capacity?"
p159
aVThe survey takes over a day.
p160
aV(Laughter)
p161
aVCombine that with a Demographic and Health Survey
p162
aVcollected by USAID in developing countries in Africa, for example,
p163
aVwhich that survey actually can go so far as to directly measure the HIV status
p164
aVof families living in, for example, rural Nigeria.
p165
aVCombine that with a world value survey,
p166
aVwhich measures the political opinions and, fortunately for me, the savings behaviors
p167
aVof millions of families in hundreds of countries around the world.
p168
aa(lp169
VTake all of that data, combine it, and this map is what you get.
p170
aVWhat you find is nine countries around the world
p171
aVthat have significant native populations
p172
aVwhich speak both futureless and futured languages.
p173
aVAnd what I'm going to do is form statistical matched pairs
p174
aVbetween families that are nearly identical on every dimension that I can measure,
p175
aVand then I'm going to explore whether or not the link between language and savings holds
p176
aVeven after controlling for all of these levels.
p177
aa(lp178
VWhat are the characteristics we can control for?
p179
aVWell I'm going to match families on country of birth and residence,
p180
aVthe demographics \u2014 what sex, their age \u2014
p181
aVtheir income level within their own country,
p182
aVtheir educational achievement, a lot about their family structure.
p183
aVIt turns out there are six different ways to be married in Europe.
p184
aVAnd most granularly, I break them down by religion
p185
aVwhere there are 72 categories of religions in the world \u2014
p186
aVso an extreme level of granularity.
p187
aVThere are 1.4 billion different ways that a family can find itself.
p188
aa(lp189
VNow effectively everything I'm going to tell you from now on
p190
aVis only comparing these basically nearly identical families.
p191
aVIt's getting as close as possible to the thought experiment
p192
aVof finding two families both of whom live in Brussels
p193
aVwho are identical on every single one of these dimensions,
p194
aVbut one of whom speaks Flemish and one of whom speaks French;
p195
aVor two families that live in a rural district in Nigeria,
p196
aVone of whom speaks Hausa and one of whom speaks Igbo.
p197
aa(lp198
VNow even after all of this granular level of control,
p199
aVdo futureless language speakers seem to save more?
p200
aVYes, futureless language speakers, even after this level of control,
p201
aVare 30 percent more likely to report having saved in any given year.
p202
aVDoes this have cumulative effects?
p203
aVYes, by the time they retire, futureless language speakers, holding constant their income,
p204
aVare going to retire with 25 percent more in savings.
p205
aa(lp206
VCan we push this data even further?
p207
aVYes, because I just told you, we actually collect a lot of health data as economists.
p208
aVNow how can we think about health behaviors to think about savings?
p209
aVWell, think about smoking, for example.
p210
aVSmoking is in some deep sense negative savings.
p211
aVIf savings is current pain in exchange for future pleasure,
p212
aVsmoking is just the opposite.
p213
aVIt's current pleasure in exchange for future pain.
p214
aVWhat we should expect then is the opposite effect.
p215
aVAnd that's exactly what we find.
p216
aVFutureless language speakers are 20 to 24 percent less likely
p217
aVto be smoking at any given point in time compared to identical families,
p218
aVand they're going to be 13 to 17 percent less likely
p219
aVto be obese by the time they retire,
p220
aVand they're going to report being 21 percent more likely
p221
aVto have used a condom in their last sexual encounter.
p222
aVI could go on and on with the list of differences that you can find.
p223
aVIt's almost impossible not to find a savings behavior
p224
aVfor which this strong effect isn't present.
p225
aa(lp226
VMy linguistics and economics colleagues at Yale and I are just starting to do this work
p227
aVand really explore and understand the ways that these subtle nudges
p228
aVcause us to think more or less about the future every single time we speak.
p229
aVUltimately, the goal,
p230
aVonce we understand how these subtle effects can change our decision making,
p231
aVwe want to be able to provide people tools
p232
aVso that they can consciously make themselves better savers
p233
aVand more conscious investors in their own future.
p234
aa(lp235
VThank you very much.

In an intriguing piece of research, Keith Chen suggests that your attitude about the future has a strong relationship to the language you speak. In a nutshell, some languages refer to the future using verb helpers like &quot;will&quot; and &quot;shall,&quot; while others don&#39;t have specific verbs to refer to future actions. Chen correlated these two different language types with remarkably different rates of saving for the future (guess who saves more?). He calls this connection the &quot;futurity&quot; of languages. <a href=\\"http://faculty.som.yale.edu/keithchen/papers/LanguageWorkingPaper.pdf\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The paper</a> is in the process of being published by the <em>American Economic Review</em>, and it&#39;s already generated discussion. Chen says: &quot;While the data I analyze don&rsquo;t allow me to completely understand what role language plays in these relationships, they suggest that there is something really remarkable to be explained about the interaction of language and economic decision-making. These correlations are so strong and survive such an aggressive set of controls, that the chances they arise by random lies somewhere between one in 10,000 and one in 10^32.&quot;</p>   <p>Chen excels in asking unusual questions to yield original results.

world to you, or more like an extension of the present? In an intriguing piece of research, Keith Chen suggests that your attitude about the future has a strong relationship to the language you speak. In a nutshell, some languages refer to the future using verb helpers like &quot;will&quot; and &quot;shall,&quot; while others don&#39;t have specific verbs to refer to future actions. Chen correlated these two different language types with remarkably different rates of saving for the future (guess who saves more?). He calls this connection the &quot;futurity&quot; of languages. <a href=\\"http://faculty.som.yale.edu/keithchen/papers/LanguageWorkingPaper.pdf\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The paper</a> is in the process of being published by the <em>American Economic Review</em>, and it&#39;s already generated discussion. Chen says: &quot;While the data I analyze don&rsquo;t allow me to completely understand what role language plays in these relationships, they suggest that there is something really remarkable to be explained about the interaction of language and economic decision-making. These correlations are so strong and survive such an aggressive set of controls, that the chances they arise by random lies somewhere between one in 10,000 and one in 10^32.&quot;</p>   <p>Chen excels in asking unusual questions to yield original results. Another work (with Yale colleague and TEDGlobal 2009 speaker&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://faculty.som.yale.edu/keithchen/papers/Final_JESP11.pdf\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Laurie Santos</a>) examined how monkeys view economic risk--with surprisingly humanlike irrationality.

VI essentially drag sledges for a living,
p5
aVso it doesn't take an awful lot to flummox me intellectually,
p6
aVbut I'm going to read this question
p7
aVfrom an interview earlier this year:
p8
aV"Philosophically, does the constant supply of information
p9
aVsteal our ability to imagine
p10
aVor replace our dreams of achieving?
p11
aVAfter all, if it is being done somewhere by someone,
p12
aVand we can participate virtually,
p13
aVthen why bother leaving the house?"
p14
aa(lp15
VI'm usually introduced as a polar explorer.
p16
aVI'm not sure that's the most progressive or 21st-century
p17
aVof job titles, but I've spent more than two percent now
p18
aVof my entire life living in a tent inside the Arctic Circle,
p19
aVso I get out of the house a fair bit.
p20
aVAnd in my nature, I guess, I am a doer of things
p21
aVmore than I am a spectator or a contemplator of things,
p22
aVand it's that dichotomy, the gulf between ideas and action
p23
aVthat I'm going to try and explore briefly.
p24
aa(lp25
VThe pithiest answer to the question "why?"
p26
aVthat's been dogging me for the last 12 years
p27
aVwas credited certainly to this chap, the rakish-looking gentleman
p28
aVstanding at the back, second from the left,
p29
aVGeorge Lee Mallory. Many of you will know his name.
p30
aVIn 1924 he was last seen disappearing into the clouds
p31
aVnear the summit of Mt. Everest.
p32
aVHe may or may not have been the first person to climb Everest,
p33
aVmore than 30 years before Edmund Hillary.
p34
aVNo one knows if he got to the top. It's still a mystery.
p35
aVBut he was credited with coining the phrase, "Because it's there."
p36
aVNow I'm not actually sure that he did say that.
p37
aVThere's very little evidence to suggest it, but what he did say
p38
aVis actually far nicer,
p39
aVand again, I've printed this. I'm going to read it out.
p40
aa(lp41
V"The first question which you will ask
p42
aVand which I must try to answer is this:
p43
aVWhat is the use of climbing Mt. Everest?
p44
aVAnd my answer must at once be, it is no use.
p45
aVThere is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever.
p46
aVOh, we may learn a little about the behavior
p47
aVof the human body at high altitudes,
p48
aVand possibly medical men may turn our observation
p49
aVto some account for the purposes of aviation,
p50
aVbut otherwise nothing will come of it.
p51
aVWe shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver,
p52
aVand not a gem, nor any coal or iron.
p53
aVWe shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted
p54
aVwith crops to raise food. So it is no use.
p55
aVIf you cannot understand that there is something in man
p56
aVwhich responds to the challenge of this mountain
p57
aVand goes out to meet it, that the struggle
p58
aVis the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward,
p59
aVthen you won't see why we go.
p60
aVWhat we get from this adventure is just sheer joy,
p61
aVand joy, after all, is the end of life.
p62
aVWe don't live to eat and make money.
p63
aVWe eat and make money to be able to enjoy life.
p64
aVThat is what life means, and that is what life is for."
p65
aa(lp66
VMallory's argument that leaving the house,
p67
aVembarking on these grand adventures is joyful and fun,
p68
aVhowever, doesn't tally that neatly with my own experience.
p69
aVThe furthest I've ever got away from my front door
p70
aVwas in the spring of 2004. I still don't know exactly
p71
aVwhat came over me, but my plan was to make
p72
aVa solo and unsupported crossing of the Arctic Ocean.
p73
aVI planned essentially to walk from the north coast of Russia
p74
aVto the North Pole, and then to carry on to the north coast of Canada.
p75
aVNo one had ever done this. I was 26 at the time.
p76
aVA lot of experts were saying it was impossible,
p77
aVand my mum certainly wasn't very keen on the idea.
p78
aV(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
VThe journey from a small weather station on the north coast
p81
aVof Siberia up to my final starting point,
p82
aVthe edge of the pack ice, the coast of the Arctic Ocean,
p83
aVtook about five hours, and if anyone watched fearless
p84
aVFelix Baumgartner going up, rather than just coming down,
p85
aVyou'll appreciate the sense of apprehension,
p86
aVas I sat in a helicopter thundering north,
p87
aVand the sense, I think if anything, of impending doom.
p88
aVI sat there wondering what on Earth I had gotten myself into.
p89
aVThere was a bit of fun, a bit of joy.
p90
aVI was 26. I remember sitting there
p91
aVlooking down at my sledge. I had my skis ready to go,
p92
aVI had a satellite phone, a pump-action shotgun
p93
aVin case I was attacked by a polar bear.
p94
aVI remember looking out of the window and seeing the second helicopter.
p95
aVWe were both thundering through this incredible Siberian dawn,
p96
aVand part of me felt a bit like a cross between Jason Bourne
p97
aVand Wilfred Thesiger. Part of me
p98
aVfelt quite proud of myself, but mostly I was just utterly terrified.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd that journey lasted 10 weeks, 72 days.
p101
aVI didn't see anyone else. We took this photo next to the helicopter.
p102
aVBeyond that, I didn't see anyone for 10 weeks.
p103
aVThe North Pole is slap bang in the middle of the sea,
p104
aVso I'm traveling over the frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean.
p105
aVNASA described conditions that year as the worst since records began.
p106
aVI was dragging 180 kilos of food and fuel and supplies,
p107
aVabout 400 pounds. The average temperature for the 10 weeks
p108
aVwas minus 35. Minus 50 was the coldest.
p109
aVSo again, there wasn't an awful lot of joy or fun to be had.
p110
aa(lp111
VOne of the magical things about this journey, however,
p112
aVis that because I'm walking over the sea,
p113
aVover this floating, drifting, shifting crust of ice
p114
aVthat's floating on top of the Arctic Ocean is
p115
aVit's an environment that's in a constant state of flux.
p116
aVThe ice is always moving, breaking up, drifting around,
p117
aVrefreezing, so the scenery that I saw for nearly 3 months
p118
aVwas unique to me. No one else will ever, could ever,
p119
aVpossibly see the views, the vistas, that I saw for 10 weeks.
p120
aVAnd that, I guess, is probably the finest argument for leaving the house.
p121
aVI can try to tell you what it was like,
p122
aVbut you'll never know what it was like,
p123
aVand the more I try to explain that I felt lonely,
p124
aVI was the only human being in 5.4 million square-miles,
p125
aVit was cold, nearly minus 75 with windchill on a bad day,
p126
aVthe more words fall short, and I'm unable to do it justice.
p127
aVAnd it seems to me, therefore, that the doing,
p128
aVyou know, to try to experience, to engage, to endeavor,
p129
aVrather than to watch and to wonder, that's where
p130
aVthe real meat of life is to be found,
p131
aVthe juice that we can suck out of our hours and days.
p132
aVAnd I would add a cautionary note here, however.
p133
aVIn my experience, there is something addictive
p134
aVabout tasting life at the very edge of what's humanly possible.
p135
aVNow I don't just mean in the field of
p136
aVdaft macho Edwardian style derring-do,
p137
aVbut also in the fields of pancreatic cancer,
p138
aVthere is something addictive about this, and in my case,
p139
aVI think polar expeditions are perhaps not that far removed
p140
aVfrom having a crack habit.
p141
aVI can't explain quite how good it is until you've tried it,
p142
aVbut it has the capacity to burn up all the money I can get my hands on,
p143
aVto ruin every relationship I've ever had,
p144
aVso be careful what you wish for.
p145
aa(lp146
VMallory postulated that there is something in man
p147
aVthat responds to the challenge of the mountain,
p148
aVand I wonder if that's the case whether there's something
p149
aVin the challenge itself, in the endeavor, and particularly
p150
aVin the big, unfinished, chunky challenges that face humanity
p151
aVthat call out to us, and in my experience that's certainly the case.
p152
aVThere is one unfinished challenge
p153
aVthat's been calling out to me for most of my adult life.
p154
aa(lp155
VMany of you will know the story.
p156
aVThis is a photo of Captain Scott and his team.
p157
aVScott set out just over a hundred years ago to try
p158
aVto become the first person to reach the South Pole.
p159
aVNo one knew what was there. It was utterly unmapped
p160
aVat the time. We knew more about the surface of the moon
p161
aVthan we did about the heart of Antarctica.
p162
aVScott, as many of you will know, was beaten to it
p163
aVby Roald Amundsen and his Norwegian team,
p164
aVwho used dogs and dogsleds. Scott's team were on foot,
p165
aVall five of them wearing harnesses and dragging around sledges,
p166
aVand they arrived at the pole to find the Norwegian flag already there,
p167
aVI'd imagine pretty bitter and demoralized.
p168
aVAll five of them turned and started walking back to the coast
p169
aVand all five died on that return journey.
p170
aa(lp171
VThere is a sort of misconception nowadays that
p172
aVit's all been done in the fields of exploration and adventure.
p173
aVWhen I talk about Antarctica, people often say,
p174
aV"Hasn't, you know, that's interesting,
p175
aVhasn't that Blue Peter presenter just done it on a bike?"
p176
aVOr, "That's nice. You know, my grandmother's going
p177
aVon a cruise to Antarctica next year. You know.
p178
aVIs there a chance you'll see her there?"
p179
aV(Laughter)
p180
aa(lp181
VBut Scott's journey remains unfinished.
p182
aVNo one has ever walked from the very coast of Antarctica
p183
aVto the South Pole and back again.
p184
aVIt is, arguably, the most audacious endeavor
p185
aVof that Edwardian golden age of exploration,
p186
aVand it seemed to me high time, given everything
p187
aVwe have figured out in the century since
p188
aVfrom scurvy to solar panels, that it was high time
p189
aVsomeone had a go at finishing the job.
p190
aVSo that's precisely what I'm setting out to do.
p191
aa(lp192
VThis time next year, in October, I'm leading a team of three.
p193
aVIt will take us about four months to make this return journey.
p194
aVThat's the scale. The red line is obviously halfway to the pole.
p195
aVWe have to turn around and come back again.
p196
aVI'm well aware of the irony of telling you that we will be
p197
aVblogging and tweeting. You'll be able to live
p198
aVvicariously and virtually through this journey
p199
aVin a way that no one has ever before.
p200
aVAnd it'll also be a four-month chance for me to finally
p201
aVcome up with a pithy answer to the question, "Why?"
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd our lives today are safer and more comfortable
p204
aVthan they have ever been. There certainly isn't much call
p205
aVfor explorers nowadays. My career advisor at school
p206
aVnever mentioned it as an option.
p207
aVIf I wanted to know, for example,
p208
aVhow many stars were in the Milky Way,
p209
aVhow old those giant heads on Easter Island were,
p210
aVmost of you could find that out right now
p211
aVwithout even standing up.
p212
aVAnd yet, if I've learned anything in nearly 12 years now
p213
aVof dragging heavy things around cold places,
p214
aVit is that true, real inspiration and growth
p215
aVonly comes from adversity and from challenge,
p216
aVfrom stepping away from what's comfortable and familiar
p217
aVand stepping out into the unknown.
p218
aVIn life, we all have tempests to ride and poles to walk to,
p219
aVand I think metaphorically speaking, at least,
p220
aVwe could all benefit from getting outside the house
p221
aVa little more often, if only we could summon up the courage.
p222
aVI certainly would implore you to open the door just a little bit
p223
aVand take a look at what's outside.
p224
aVThank you very much.
p225
aV(Applause)

In 2004, at age 26, he skied solo to the North Pole, updating his blog  each day of the trip.

His message is one of inspiration, empowerment and boundless potential. <br /><br />He urges audiences to consider carefully how to spend the &ldquo;tiny amount of time we each have on this planet.&rdquo; Saunders is also a powerful advocate for the natural world. He&#39;s seen first-hand the effects of climate change, and his expeditions are raising awareness for sustainable solutions.&nbsp;</p><p>Being the youngest person to ski solo to the North Pole did not satiate Saunders&#39; urge to explore and push the boundaries.

planet&#39;s surface was mapped long ago, there&#39;s still a place for explorers in the modern world. And Ben Saunders&#39; stories of arctic exploration -- as impressive for their technical ingenuity as their derring-do -- are decidedly modern. In 2004, at age 26, he skied solo to the North Pole, updating his blog  each day of the trip. Humble and self-effacing, Saunders is an explorer of limits, whether it&#39;s how far a human can be pushed physically and psychologically, or how technology works hundreds of miles from civilization.   His message is one of inspiration, empowerment and boundless potential. <br /><br />He urges audiences to consider carefully how to spend the &ldquo;tiny amount of time we each have on this planet.&rdquo; Saunders is also a powerful advocate for the natural world. He&#39;s seen first-hand the effects of climate change, and his expeditions are raising awareness for sustainable solutions.&nbsp;</p><p>Being the youngest person to ski solo to the North Pole did not satiate Saunders&#39; urge to explore and push the boundaries. In 2008, he attempted to break the speed record for a solo walk to the North Pole; however, his journey was ended abruptly both then and again in 2010 due to equipment failure. From October 2013 to February 2014, he led a two-man team to retrace Captain Robert Falcon Scott&rsquo;s ill-fated 1,800-mile expedition to the South Pole on foot.

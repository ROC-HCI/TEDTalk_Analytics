(lp4
V15 years ago, I volunteered to participate in a research study
p5
aVthat involved a genetic test.
p6
aVWhen I arrived at the clinic to be tested,
p7
aVI was handed a questionnaire.
p8
aVOne of the very first questions asked me to check a box for my race:
p9
aVWhite, black, Asian, or Native American.
p10
aa(lp11
VI wasn't quite sure how to answer the question.
p12
aVWas it aimed at measuring the diversity
p13
aVof research participants' social backgrounds?
p14
aVIn that case, I would answer with my social identity,
p15
aVand check the box for "black."
p16
aVBut what if the researchers were interested in investigating
p17
aVsome association between ancestry and the risk for certain genetic traits?
p18
aVIn that case, wouldn't they want to know something about my ancestry,
p19
aVwhich is just as much European as African?
p20
aVAnd how could they make scientific findings about my genes
p21
aVif I put down my social identity as a black woman?
p22
aVAfter all, I consider myself a black woman with a white father
p23
aVrather than a white woman with a black mother
p24
aVentirely for social reasons.
p25
aVWhich racial identity I check
p26
aVhas nothing to do with my genes.
p27
aVWell, despite the obvious importance of this question
p28
aVto the study's scientific validity,
p29
aVI was told, "Don't worry about it,
p30
aVjust put down however you identify yourself."
p31
aVSo I check "black,"
p32
aVbut I had no confidence in the results of a study
p33
aVthat treated a critical variable so unscientifically.
p34
aa(lp35
VThat personal experience with the use of race in genetic testing
p36
aVgot me thinking:
p37
aVWhere else in medicine is race used to make false biological predictions?
p38
aa(lp39
VWell, I found out that race runs deeply throughout all of medical practice.
p40
aVIt shapes physicians' diagnoses,
p41
aVmeasurements, treatments,
p42
aVprescriptions,
p43
aVeven the very definition of diseases.
p44
aVAnd the more I found out, the more disturbed I became.
p45
aa(lp46
VSociologists like me have long explained
p47
aVthat race is a social construction.
p48
aVWhen we identify people as black, white, Asian, Native American, Latina,
p49
aVwe're referring to social groupings
p50
aVwith made up demarcations that have changed over time
p51
aVand vary around the world.
p52
aVAs a legal scholar, I've also studied
p53
aVhow lawmakers, not biologists,
p54
aVhave invented the legal definitions of races.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd it's not just the view of social scientists.
p57
aVYou remember when the map of the human genome
p58
aVwas unveiled at a White House ceremony in June 2000?
p59
aVPresident Bill Clinton famously declared,
p60
aV"I believe one of the great truths
p61
aVto emerge from this triumphant expedition
p62
aVinside the human genome
p63
aVis that in genetic terms,
p64
aVhuman beings, regardless of race,
p65
aVare more than 99.9 percent the same."
p66
aVAnd he might have added
p67
aVthat that less than one percent of genetic difference
p68
aVdoesn't fall into racial boxes.
p69
aa(lp70
VFrancis Collins, who led the Human Genome Project
p71
aVand now heads NIH,
p72
aVechoed President Clinton.
p73
aV"I am happy that today,
p74
aVthe only race we're talking about is the human race."
p75
aa(lp76
VDoctors are supposed to practice evidence-based medicine,
p77
aVand they're increasingly called to join the genomic revolution.
p78
aVBut their habit of treating patients by race lags far behind.
p79
aa(lp80
VTake the estimate
p81
aVof glomerular filtration rate, or GFR.
p82
aVDoctors routinely interpret GFR,
p83
aVthis important indicator of kidney function, by race.
p84
aVAs you can see in this lab test,
p85
aVthe exact same creatinine level,
p86
aVthe concentration in the blood of the patient,
p87
aVautomatically produces a different GFR estimate
p88
aVdepending on whether or not the patient is African-American.
p89
aVWhy?
p90
aa(lp91
VI've been told it's based on an assumption
p92
aVthat African-Americans have more muscle mass
p93
aVthan people of other races.
p94
aVBut what sense does it make
p95
aVfor a doctor to automatically assume
p96
aVI have more muscle mass than that female bodybuilder?
p97
aVWouldn't it be far more accurate and evidence-based
p98
aVto determine the muscle mass of individual patients
p99
aVjust by looking at them?
p100
aa(lp101
VWell, doctors tell me they're using race as a shortcut.
p102
aVIt's a crude but convenient proxy
p103
aVfor more important factors, like muscle mass,
p104
aVenzyme level, genetic traits
p105
aVthey just don't have time to look for.
p106
aVBut race is a bad proxy.
p107
aVIn many cases, race adds no relevant information at all.
p108
aVIt's just a distraction.
p109
aVBut race also tends to overwhelm the clinical measures.
p110
aVIt blinds doctors to patients' symptoms,
p111
aVfamily illnesses,
p112
aVtheir history, their own illnesses they might have \u2014
p113
aVall more evidence-based than the patient's race.
p114
aVRace can't substitute for these important clinical measures
p115
aVwithout sacrificing patient well-being.
p116
aa(lp117
VDoctors also tell me race is just one of many factors
p118
aVthey take into account,
p119
aVbut there are numerous medical tests,
p120
aVlike the GFR,
p121
aVthat use race categorically
p122
aVto treat black, white, Asian patients differently
p123
aVjust because of their race.
p124
aa(lp125
VRace medicine also leaves patients of color especially vulnerable
p126
aVto harmful biases and stereotypes.
p127
aVBlack and Latino patients are twice as likely
p128
aVto receive no pain medication as whites
p129
aVfor the same painful long bone fractures
p130
aVbecause of stereotypes
p131
aVthat black and brown people feel less pain,
p132
aVexaggerate their pain,
p133
aVand are predisposed to drug addiction.
p134
aa(lp135
VThe Food and Drug Administration has even approved a race-specific medicine.
p136
aVIt's a pill called BiDil
p137
aVto treat heart failure in self-identified African-American patients.
p138
aVA cardiologist developed this drug without regard to race or genetics,
p139
aVbut it became convenient
p140
aVfor commercial reasons
p141
aVto market the drug to black patients.
p142
aVThe FDA then allowed
p143
aVthe company, the drug company,
p144
aVto test the efficacy in a clinical trial
p145
aVthat only included African-American subjects.
p146
aVIt speculated
p147
aVthat race stood in as a proxy for some unknown genetic factor
p148
aVthat affects heart disease
p149
aVor response to drugs.
p150
aVBut think about the dangerous message it sent,
p151
aVthat black people's bodies are so substandard,
p152
aVa drug tested in them
p153
aVis not guaranteed to work in other patients.
p154
aa(lp155
VIn the end, the drug company's marketing scheme failed.
p156
aVFor one thing, black patients were understandably wary
p157
aVof using a drug just for black people.
p158
aVOne elderly black woman stood up in a community meeting and shouted,
p159
aV"Give me what the white people are taking!"
p160
aa(lp161
V(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd if you find race-specific medicine surprising,
p164
aVwait until you learn
p165
aVthat many doctors in the United States
p166
aVstill use an updated version
p167
aVof a diagnostic tool
p168
aVthat was developed by a physician during the slavery era,
p169
aVa diagnostic tool that is tightly linked
p170
aVto justifications for slavery.
p171
aa(lp172
VDr. Samuel Cartwright graduated
p173
aVfrom the University of Pennsylvania Medical School.
p174
aVHe practiced in the Deep South before the Civil War,
p175
aVand he was a well-known expert on what was then called "Negro medicine."
p176
aVHe promoted the racial concept of disease,
p177
aVthat people of different races suffer from different diseases
p178
aVand experience common diseases differently.
p179
aVCartwright argued in the 1850s
p180
aVthat slavery was beneficial for black people
p181
aVfor medical reasons.
p182
aVHe claimed that because black people have lower lung capacity than whites,
p183
aVforced labor was good for them.
p184
aVHe wrote in a medical journal,
p185
aV"It is the red vital blood sent to the brain
p186
aVthat liberates their minds when under the white man's control,
p187
aVand it is the want of sufficiency of red vital blood
p188
aVthat chains their minds to ignorance and barbarism when in freedom."
p189
aVTo support this theory, Cartwright helped to perfect
p190
aVa medical device for measuring breathing called the spirometer
p191
aVto show the presumed deficiency in black people's lungs.
p192
aa(lp193
VToday, doctors still uphold Cartwright's claim
p194
aVthe black people as a race
p195
aVhave lower lung capacity than white people.
p196
aVSome even use a modern day spirometer
p197
aVthat actually has a button labeled "race"
p198
aVso the machine adjusts the measurement
p199
aVfor each patient according to his or her race.
p200
aVIt's a well-known function called "correcting for race."
p201
aa(lp202
VThe problem with race medicine extends far beyond misdiagnosing patients.
p203
aVIts focus on innate racial differences in disease
p204
aVdiverts attention and resources
p205
aVfrom the social determinants
p206
aVthat cause appalling racial gaps in health:
p207
aVlack of access to high-quality medical care;
p208
aVfood deserts in poor neighborhoods;
p209
aVexposure to environmental toxins;
p210
aVhigh rates of incarceration;
p211
aVand experiencing the stress of racial discrimination.
p212
aa(lp213
VYou see, race is not a biological category
p214
aVthat naturally produces these health disparities
p215
aVbecause of genetic difference.
p216
aVRace is a social category
p217
aVthat has staggering biological consequences,
p218
aVbut because of the impact of social inequality on people's health.
p219
aVYet race medicine pretends the answer to these gaps in health
p220
aVcan be found in a race-specific pill.
p221
aVIt's much easier and more lucrative
p222
aVto market a technological fix
p223
aVfor these gaps in health
p224
aVthan to deal with the structural inequities that produce them.
p225
aa(lp226
VThe reason I'm so passionate about ending race medicine
p227
aVisn't just because it's bad medicine.
p228
aVI'm also on this mission
p229
aVbecause the way doctors practice medicine
p230
aVcontinues to promote a false and toxic view of humanity.
p231
aVDespite the many visionary breakthroughs in medicine we've been learning about,
p232
aVthere's a failure of imagination
p233
aVwhen it comes to race.
p234
aVWould you imagine with me, just a moment:
p235
aVWhat would happen if doctors stopped treating patients by race?
p236
aVSuppose they rejected
p237
aVan 18th-century classification system
p238
aVand incorporated instead the most advanced knowledge
p239
aVof human genetic diversity and unity,
p240
aVthat human beings cannot be categorized into biological races?
p241
aVWhat if, instead of using race as a crude proxy
p242
aVfor some more important factor,
p243
aVdoctors actually investigated and addressed that more important factor?
p244
aVWhat if doctors joined the forefront
p245
aVof a movement to end the structural inequities
p246
aVcaused by racism,
p247
aVnot by genetic difference?
p248
aa(lp249
VRace medicine is bad medicine,
p250
aVit's poor science
p251
aVand it's a false interpretation of humanity.
p252
aVIt is more urgent than ever
p253
aVto finally abandon this backward legacy
p254
aVand to affirm our common humanity
p255
aVby ending the social inequalities that truly divide us.
p256
aa(lp257
VThank you.
p258
aa(lp259
V(Applause)
p260
aa(lp261
VThank you. Thanks.
p262
aVThank you.

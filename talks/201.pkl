VSo I thought, "I will talk about death."
p5
aVSeemed to be the passion today.
p6
aVActually, it's not about death.
p7
aVIt's inevitable, terrible, but really what I want to talk about is,
p8
aVI'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die.
p9
aVThat's what I want to talk about.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo Art Buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video
p12
aVthat appeared soon after he died, saying,
p13
aV"Hi! I'm Art Buchwald, and I just died."
p14
aVAnd Mike, who I met at Galapagos, a trip which I won at TED,
p15
aVis leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling
p16
aVhis journey through cancer.
p17
aVAnd my father left me a legacy of his handwriting
p18
aVthrough letters and a notebook.
p19
aVIn the last two years of his life, when he was sick,
p20
aVhe filled a notebook with his thoughts about me.
p21
aVHe wrote about my strengths, weaknesses,
p22
aVand gentle suggestions for improvement,
p23
aVquoting specific incidents, and held a mirror to my life.
p24
aa(lp25
VAfter he died, I realized that no one writes to me anymore.
p26
aVHandwriting is a disappearing art.
p27
aVI'm all for email and thinking while typing,
p28
aVbut why give up old habits for new?
p29
aVWhy can't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives?
p30
aVThere are times when I want to trade all those years
p31
aVthat I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him,
p32
aVand trade all those years for one hug.
p33
aVBut too late.
p34
aVBut that's when I take out his letters and I read them,
p35
aVand the paper that touched his hand is in mine,
p36
aVand I feel connected to him.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo maybe we all need to leave our children
p39
aVwith a value legacy, and not a financial one.
p40
aVA value for things with a personal touch \u2014
p41
aVan autographed book, a soul-searching letter.
p42
aVIf a fraction of this powerful TED audience
p43
aVcould be inspired to buy a beautiful paper \u2014
p44
aVJohn, it'll be a recycled one \u2014 and write a beautiful letter
p45
aVto someone they love, we actually may start a revolution
p46
aVwhere our children may go to penmanship classes.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo what do I plan to leave for my son?
p49
aVI collect autographed books, and those of you authors
p50
aVin the audience know I hound you for them \u2014
p51
aVand CDs too, Tracy.
p52
aVI plan to publish my own notebook.
p53
aVAs I witnessed my father's body being swallowed by fire,
p54
aVI sat by his funeral pyre and wrote.
p55
aVI have no idea how I'm going to do it,
p56
aVbut I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine
p57
aVinto a book, and leave that published book for my son.
p58
aa(lp59
VI'd like to end with a few verses of what I wrote
p60
aVat my father's cremation.
p61
aVAnd those linguists, please pardon the grammar,
p62
aVbecause I've not looked at it in the last 10 years.
p63
aVI took it out for the first time to come here.
p64
aV"Picture in a frame, ashes in a bottle,
p65
aVboundless energy confined in the bottle,
p66
aVforcing me to deal with reality,
p67
aVforcing me to deal with being grown up.
p68
aVI hear you and I know that you would want me to be strong,
p69
aVbut right now, I am being sucked down, surrounded
p70
aVand suffocated by these raging emotional waters,
p71
aVcraving to cleanse my soul, trying to emerge
p72
aVon a firm footing one more time, to keep on fighting and flourishing
p73
aVjust as you taught me.
p74
aVYour encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair,
p75
aVholding me and heaving me to shores of sanity,
p76
aVto live again and to love again."
p77
aVThank you.

VYour company launches a search for an open position.
p5
aVThe applications start rolling in,
p6
aVand the qualified candidates are identified.
p7
aVNow the choosing begins.
p8
aVPerson A: Ivy League, 4.0, flawless resume,
p9
aVgreat recommendations.
p10
aVAll the right stuff.
p11
aVPerson B: state school, fair amount of job hopping,
p12
aVand odd jobs like cashier and singing waitress.
p13
aVBut remember \u2014 both are qualified.
p14
aVSo I ask you:
p15
aVwho are you going to pick?
p16
aa(lp17
VMy colleagues and I created very official terms
p18
aVto describe two distinct categories of candidates.
p19
aVWe call A "the Silver Spoon,"
p20
aVthe one who clearly had advantages and was destined for success.
p21
aVAnd we call B "the Scrapper,"
p22
aVthe one who had to fight against tremendous odds
p23
aVto get to the same point.
p24
aVYou just heard a human resources director refer to people
p25
aVas Silver Spoons and Scrappers \u2014
p26
aa(lp27
V(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
Vwhich is not exactly politically correct and sounds a bit judgmental.
p30
aVBut before my human resources certification gets revoked \u2014
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
Vlet me explain.
p35
aa(lp36
VA resume tells a story.
p37
aVAnd over the years, I've learned something about people
p38
aVwhose experiences read like a patchwork quilt,
p39
aVthat makes me stop and fully consider them
p40
aVbefore tossing their resumes away.
p41
aVA series of odd jobs may indicate
p42
aVinconsistency, lack of focus, unpredictability.
p43
aVOr it may signal a committed struggle against obstacles.
p44
aVAt the very least, the Scrapper deserves an interview.
p45
aa(lp46
VTo be clear,
p47
aVI don't hold anything against the Silver Spoon;
p48
aVgetting into and graduating from an elite university
p49
aVtakes a lot of hard work and sacrifice.
p50
aVBut if your whole life has been engineered toward success,
p51
aVhow will you handle the tough times?
p52
aVOne person I hired felt that because he attended an elite university,
p53
aVthere were certain assignments that were beneath him,
p54
aVlike temporarily doing manual labor to better understand an operation.
p55
aVEventually, he quit.
p56
aVBut on the flip side,
p57
aVwhat happens when your whole life is destined for failure
p58
aVand you actually succeed?
p59
aa(lp60
VI want to urge you to interview the Scrapper.
p61
aVI know a lot about this because I am a Scrapper.
p62
aVBefore I was born,
p63
aVmy father was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia,
p64
aVand he couldn't hold a job in spite of his brilliance.
p65
aVOur lives were one part "Cuckoo's Nest,"
p66
aVone part "Awakenings"
p67
aVand one part "A Beautiful Mind."
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VI'm the fourth of five children raised by a single mother
p72
aVin a rough neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York.
p73
aVWe never owned a home, a car, a washing machine,
p74
aVand for most of my childhood, we didn't even have a telephone.
p75
aVSo I was highly motivated
p76
aVto understand the relationship between business success and Scrappers,
p77
aVbecause my life could easily have turned out very differently.
p78
aVAs I met successful business people
p79
aVand read profiles of high-powered leaders,
p80
aVI noticed some commonality.
p81
aa(lp82
VMany of them had experienced early hardships,
p83
aVanywhere from poverty, abandonment,
p84
aVdeath of a parent while young,
p85
aVto learning disabilities, alcoholism and violence.
p86
aVThe conventional thinking has been that trauma leads to distress,
p87
aVand there's been a lot of focus on the resulting dysfunction.
p88
aVBut during studies of dysfunction, data revealed an unexpected insight:
p89
aVthat even the worst circumstances can result in growth and transformation.
p90
aVA remarkable and counterintuitive phenomenon has been discovered,
p91
aVwhich scientists call Post Traumatic Growth.
p92
aa(lp93
VIn one study designed to measure the effects of adversity
p94
aVon children at risk,
p95
aVamong a subset of 698 children
p96
aVwho experienced the most severe and extreme conditions,
p97
aVfully one-third grew up to lead healthy, successful and productive lives.
p98
aVIn spite of everything and against tremendous odds, they succeeded.
p99
aVOne-third.
p100
aa(lp101
VTake this resume.
p102
aVThis guy's parents give him up for adoption.
p103
aVHe never finishes college.
p104
aVHe job-hops quite a bit,
p105
aVgoes on a sojourn to India for a year,
p106
aVand to top it off, he has dyslexia.
p107
aVWould you hire this guy?
p108
aVHis name is Steve Jobs.
p109
aa(lp110
VIn a study of the world's most highly successful entrepreneurs,
p111
aVit turns out a disproportionate number have dyslexia.
p112
aVIn the US,
p113
aV35 percent of the entrepreneurs studied had dyslexia.
p114
aVWhat's remarkable \u2014 among those entrepreneurs
p115
aVwho experience post traumatic growth,
p116
aVthey now view their learning disability
p117
aVas a desirable difficulty which provided them an advantage
p118
aVbecause they became better listeners and paid greater attention to detail.
p119
aVThey don't think they are who they are in spite of adversity,
p120
aVthey know they are who they are because of adversity.
p121
aVThey embrace their trauma and hardships
p122
aVas key elements of who they've become,
p123
aVand know that without those experiences,
p124
aVthey might not have developed the muscle and grit required
p125
aVto become successful.
p126
aa(lp127
VOne of my colleagues had his life completely upended
p128
aVas a result of the Chinese Cultural Revolution in 1966.
p129
aVAt age 13, his parents were relocated to the countryside,
p130
aVthe schools were closed
p131
aVand he was left alone in Beijing to fend for himself until 16,
p132
aVwhen he got a job in a clothing factory.
p133
aVBut instead of accepting his fate,
p134
aVhe made a resolution that he would continue his formal education.
p135
aVEleven years later, when the political landscape changed,
p136
aVhe heard about a highly selective university admissions test.
p137
aVHe had three months to learn the entire curriculum
p138
aVof middle and high school.
p139
aVSo, every day he came home from the factory,
p140
aVtook a nap, studied until 4am, went back to work
p141
aVand repeated this cycle every day for three months.
p142
aVHe did it, he succeeded.
p143
aVHis commitment to his education was unwavering, and he never lost hope.
p144
aVToday, he holds a master's degree,
p145
aVand his daughters each have degrees from Cornell and Harvard.
p146
aa(lp147
VScrappers are propelled by the belief
p148
aVthat the only person you have full control over is yourself.
p149
aVWhen things don't turn out well,
p150
aVScrappers ask, "What can I do differently to create a better result?"
p151
aVScrappers have a sense of purpose
p152
aVthat prevents them from giving up on themselves,
p153
aVkind of like if you've survived poverty, a crazy father and several muggings,
p154
aVyou figure, "Business challenges? \u2014
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VReally?
p159
aVPiece of cake. I got this."
p160
aa(lp161
V(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd that reminds me \u2014 humor.
p164
aVScrappers know that humor gets you through the tough times,
p165
aVand laughter helps you change your perspective.
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd finally, there are relationships.
p168
aVPeople who overcome adversity don't do it alone.
p169
aVSomewhere along the way,
p170
aVthey find people who bring out the best in them
p171
aVand who are invested in their success.
p172
aVHaving someone you can count on no matter what
p173
aVis essential to overcoming adversity.
p174
aVI was lucky.
p175
aVIn my first job after college,
p176
aVI didn't have a car, so I carpooled across two bridges
p177
aVwith a woman who was the president's assistant.
p178
aVShe watched me work
p179
aVand encouraged me to focus on my future
p180
aVand not dwell on my past.
p181
aVAlong the way I've met many people
p182
aVwho've provided me brutally honest feedback,
p183
aVadvice and mentorship.
p184
aVThese people don't mind
p185
aVthat I once worked as a singing waitress to help pay for college.
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VI'll leave you with one final, valuable insight.
p190
aVCompanies that are committed to diversity and inclusive practices
p191
aVtend to support Scrappers
p192
aVand outperform their peers.
p193
aVAccording to DiversityInc,
p194
aVa study of their top 50 companies for diversity
p195
aVoutperformed the S&P 500 by 25 percent.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo back to my original question.
p198
aVWho are you going to bet on:
p199
aVSilver Spoon or Scrapper?
p200
aVI say choose the underestimated contender,
p201
aVwhose secret weapons are passion and purpose.
p202
aa(lp203
VHire the Scrapper.
p204
aa(lp205
V(Applause)

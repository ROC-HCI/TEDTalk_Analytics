VThat's how we traveled in the year 1900.
p5
aVThat's an open buggy. It doesn't have heating.
p6
aVIt doesn't have air conditioning.
p7
aVThat horse is pulling it along
p8
aVat one percent of the speed of sound,
p9
aVand the rutted dirt road
p10
aVturns into a quagmire of mud anytime it rains.
p11
aVThat's a Boeing 707.
p12
aVOnly 60 years later, it travels
p13
aVat 80 percent of the speed of sound,
p14
aVand we don't travel any faster today
p15
aVbecause commercial supersonic air travel
p16
aVturned out to be a bust.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo I started wondering and pondering,
p19
aVcould it be that the best years of American economic growth
p20
aVare behind us?
p21
aVAnd that leads to the suggestion, maybe economic growth
p22
aVis almost over.
p23
aVSome of the reasons for this are not really very controversial.
p24
aVThere are four headwinds that are just hitting
p25
aVthe American economy in the face.
p26
aVThey're demographics, education, debt and inequality.
p27
aVThey're powerful enough to cut growth in half.
p28
aVSo we need a lot of innovation to offset this decline.
p29
aVAnd here's my theme: Because of the headwinds,
p30
aVif innovation continues to be as powerful as it has been
p31
aVin the last 150 years, growth is cut in half.
p32
aVIf innovation is less powerful,
p33
aVinvents less great, wonderful things,
p34
aVthen growth is going to be even lower than half of history.
p35
aa(lp36
VNow here's eight centuries of economic growth.
p37
aVThe vertical axis is just percent per year of growth,
p38
aVzero percent a year, one percent a year, two percent a year.
p39
aVThe white line is for the U.K., and then the U.S.
p40
aVtakes over as the leading nation in the year 1900,
p41
aVwhen the line switches to red.
p42
aVYou'll notice that, for the first four centuries,
p43
aVthere's hardly any growth at all, just 0.2 percent.
p44
aVThen growth gets better and better.
p45
aVIt maxes out in the 1930s, '40s and '50s,
p46
aVand then it starts slowing down, and here's a cautionary note.
p47
aVThat last downward notch in the red line
p48
aVis not actual data.
p49
aVThat is a forecast that I made six years ago
p50
aVthat growth would slow down to 1.3 percent.
p51
aVBut you know what the actual facts are?
p52
aVYou know what the growth in per-person income has been
p53
aVin the United States in the last six years?
p54
aVNegative.
p55
aa(lp56
VThis led to a fantasy.
p57
aVWhat if I try to fit a curved line to this historical record?
p58
aVI can make the curved line end anywhere I wanted,
p59
aVbut I decided I would end it at 0.2,
p60
aVjust like the U.K. growth for the first four centuries.
p61
aVNow the history that we've achieved is that we've grown
p62
aVat 2.0 percent per year over the whole period,
p63
aV1891 to 2007,
p64
aVand remember it's been a little bit negative since 2007.
p65
aVBut if growth slows down,
p66
aVinstead of doubling our standard of living every generation,
p67
aVAmericans in the future can't expect to be twice as well off as their parents,
p68
aVor even a quarter [more well off than] their parents.
p69
aVNow we're going to change and look at the level of per capita income.
p70
aVThe vertical axis now is thousands of dollars in today's prices.
p71
aVYou'll notice that in 1891, over on the left,
p72
aVwe were at about 5,000 dollars.
p73
aVToday we're at about 44,000 dollars of total output
p74
aVper member of the population.
p75
aVNow what if we could achieve that historic
p76
aVtwo-percent growth for the next 70 years?
p77
aVWell, it's a matter of arithmetic.
p78
aVTwo-percent growth quadruples your standard of living in 70 years.
p79
aVThat means we'd go from 44,000 to 180,000.
p80
aVWell, we're not going to do that,
p81
aVand the reason is the headwinds.
p82
aa(lp83
VThe first headwind is demographics.
p84
aVIt's a truism that your standard of living
p85
aVrises faster than productivity, rises faster than output per hour,
p86
aVif hours per person increased.
p87
aVAnd we got that gift back in the '70s and '80s
p88
aVwhen women entered the labor force.
p89
aVBut now it's turned around.
p90
aVNow hours per person are shrinking,
p91
aVfirst because of the retirement of the baby boomers,
p92
aVand second because there's been a very significant
p93
aVdropping out of the labor force of prime age adult males
p94
aVwho are in the bottom half of the educational distribution.
p95
aa(lp96
VThe next headwind is education.
p97
aVWe've got problems all over our educational system
p98
aVdespite Race to the Top.
p99
aVIn college, we've got cost inflation in higher education
p100
aVthat dwarfs cost inflation in medical care.
p101
aVWe have in higher education a trillion dollars of student debt,
p102
aVand our college completion rate
p103
aVis 15 points, 15 percentage points below Canada.
p104
aVWe have a lot of debt.
p105
aVOur economy grew from 2000 to 2007
p106
aVon the back of consumers massively overborrowing.
p107
aVConsumers paying off that debt is one of the main reasons
p108
aVwhy our economic recovery is so sluggish today.
p109
aVAnd everybody of course knows
p110
aVthat the federal government debt is growing
p111
aVas a share of GDP at a very rapid rate,
p112
aVand the only way that's going to stop is some combination
p113
aVof faster growth in taxes or slower growth in entitlements,
p114
aValso called transfer payments.
p115
aVAnd that gets us down from the 1.5,
p116
aVwhere we've reached for education, down to 1.3.
p117
aa(lp118
VAnd then we have inequality.
p119
aVOver the 15 years before the financial crisis,
p120
aVthe growth rate of the bottom 99 percent
p121
aVof the income distribution was half a point slower
p122
aVthan the averages we've been talking about before.
p123
aVAll the rest went to the top one percent.
p124
aVSo that brings us down to 0.8.
p125
aVAnd that 0.8 is the big challenge.
p126
aVAre we going to grow at 0.8?
p127
aVIf so, that's going to require that our inventions
p128
aVare as important as the ones that happened
p129
aVover the last 150 years.
p130
aVSo let's see what some of those inventions were.
p131
aa(lp132
VIf you wanted to read in 1875 at night,
p133
aVyou needed to have an oil or a gas lamp.
p134
aVThey created pollution, they created odors,
p135
aVthey were hard to control, the light was dim,
p136
aVand they were a fire hazard.
p137
aVBy 1929, electric light was everywhere.
p138
aVWe had the vertical city, the invention of the elevator.
p139
aVCentral Manhattan became possible.
p140
aVAnd then, in addition to that, at the same time,
p141
aVhand tools were replaced by massive electric tools
p142
aVand hand-powered electric tools,
p143
aVall achieved by electricity.
p144
aa(lp145
VElectricity was also very helpful in liberating women.
p146
aVWomen, back in the late 19th century,
p147
aVspent two days a week doing the laundry.
p148
aVThey did it on a scrub board.
p149
aVThen they had to hang the clothes out to dry.
p150
aVThen they had to bring them in.
p151
aVThe whole thing took two days out of the seven-day week.
p152
aVAnd then we had the electric washing machine.
p153
aVAnd by 1950, they were everywhere.
p154
aVBut the women still had to shop every day,
p155
aVbut no they didn't, because electricity
p156
aVbrought us the electric refrigerator.
p157
aa(lp158
VBack in the late 19th century, the only source of heat in most homes
p159
aVwas a big fireplace in the kitchen that was used for cooking and heating.
p160
aVThe bedrooms were cold. They were unheated.
p161
aVBut by 1929, certainly by 1950,
p162
aVwe had central heating everywhere.
p163
aa(lp164
VWhat about the internal combustion engine,
p165
aVwhich was invented in 1879?
p166
aVIn America, before the motor vehicle,
p167
aVtransportation depended entirely on the urban horse,
p168
aVwhich dropped, without restraint,
p169
aV25 to 50 pounds of manure on the streets every day
p170
aVtogether with a gallon of urine.
p171
aVThat comes out at five to 10 tons daily
p172
aVper square mile in cities.
p173
aVThose horses also ate up fully one quarter of American agricultural land.
p174
aVThat's the percentage of American agricultural land
p175
aVit took to feed the horses.
p176
aVOf course, when the motor vehicle was invented,
p177
aVand it became almost ubiquitous by 1929,
p178
aVthat agricultural land could be used for human consumption
p179
aVor for export.
p180
aVAnd here's an interesting ratio: Starting from zero in 1900,
p181
aVonly 30 years later, the ratio of motor vehicles to the number of households
p182
aVin the United States reached 90 percent in just 30 years.
p183
aa(lp184
VBack before the turn of the century,
p185
aVwomen had another problem.
p186
aVAll the water for cooking, cleaning and bathing
p187
aVhad to be carried in buckets and pails in from the outside.
p188
aVIt's a historical fact that in 1885,
p189
aVthe average North Carolina housewife
p190
aVwalked 148 miles a year carrying 35 tons of water.
p191
aVBut by 1929, cities around the country
p192
aVhad put in underground water pipes.
p193
aVThey had put in underground sewer pipes,
p194
aVand as a result, one of the great scourges of the late 19th century,
p195
aVwaterborne diseases like cholera, began to disappear.
p196
aVAnd an amazing fact for techno-optimists
p197
aVis that in the first half of the 20th century,
p198
aVthe rate of improvement of life expectancy
p199
aVwas three times faster than it was
p200
aVin the second half of the 19th century.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo it's a truism that things can't be more than 100 percent of themselves.
p203
aVAnd I'll just give you a few examples.
p204
aVWe went from one percent to 90 percent of the speed of sound.
p205
aVElectrification, central heat, ownership of motor cars,
p206
aVthey all went from zero to 100 percent.
p207
aVUrban environments make people more productive than on the farm.
p208
aVWe went from 25 percent urban to 75 percent
p209
aVby the early postwar years.
p210
aa(lp211
VWhat about the electronic revolution?
p212
aVHere's an early computer.
p213
aVIt's amazing. The mainframe computer was invented in 1942.
p214
aVBy 1960 we had telephone bills, bank statements
p215
aVwere being produced by computers.
p216
aVThe earliest cell phones, the earliest personal computers
p217
aVwere invented in the 1970s.
p218
aVThe 1980s brought us Bill Gates, DOS,
p219
aVATM machines to replace bank tellers,
p220
aVbar code scanning to cut down on labor in the retail sector.
p221
aVFast forward through the '90s,
p222
aVwe had the dotcom revolution
p223
aVand a temporary rise in productivity growth.
p224
aa(lp225
VBut I'm now going to give you an experiment.
p226
aVYou have to choose either option A or option B.
p227
aV(Laughter)
p228
aVOption A is you get to keep everything invented up till 10 years ago.
p229
aVSo you get Google, you get Amazon,
p230
aVyou get Wikipedia, and you get running water and indoor toilets.
p231
aVOr you get everything invented to yesterday,
p232
aVincluding Facebook and your iPhone,
p233
aVbut you have to give up, go out to the outhouse,
p234
aVand carry in the water.
p235
aVHurricane Sandy caused a lot of people to lose the 20th century,
p236
aVmaybe for a couple of days,
p237
aVin some cases for more than a week,
p238
aVelectricity, running water, heating, gasoline for their cars,
p239
aVand a charge for their iPhones.
p240
aa(lp241
VThe problem we face is that all these great inventions,
p242
aVwe have to match them in the future,
p243
aVand my prediction that we're not going to match them
p244
aVbrings us down from the original two-percent growth
p245
aVdown to 0.2, the fanciful curve that I drew you at the beginning.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo here we are back to the horse and buggy.
p248
aVI'd like to award an Oscar
p249
aVto the inventors of the 20th century,
p250
aVthe people from Alexander Graham Bell
p251
aVto Thomas Edison to the Wright Brothers,
p252
aVI'd like to call them all up here,
p253
aVand they're going to call back to you.
p254
aVYour challenge is, can you match what we achieved?
p255
aa(lp256
VThank you.

In a recent paper, he suggests that the repeated doubling of economic growth that characterized the 20th century and was arguably the bedrock for modern society may be decelerating at an alarming rate -- especially for the bottom 99 percent of the income distribution.

Gordon has written prolifically about the problems facing contemporary economic growth, casting a sobering doubt on the ability of our current innovations (what he calls the &quot;third industrial revolution,&quot; including all our fancy gadgets) to power the economy the way previous waves of invention. In a recent paper, he suggests that the repeated doubling of economic growth that characterized the 20th century and was arguably the bedrock for modern society may be decelerating at an alarming rate -- especially for the bottom 99 percent of the income distribution. While innovation is continuing apace, he sees the economy buffeted by six headwinds, and a different mix of obstacles for the US economy than for Canada and Europe.</p><p>Over the past four decades, he&#39;s also done fascinating work on the economics of the airline industry.

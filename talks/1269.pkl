VI started Improv Everywhere about 10 years ago
p5
aVwhen I moved to New York City with an interest in acting and comedy.
p6
aVBecause I was new to the city, I didn't have access to a stage,
p7
aVso I decided to create my own in public places.
p8
aa(lp9
VSo the first project we're going to take a look at
p10
aVis the very first No Pants Subway Ride.
p11
aVNow, this took place in January of 2002.
p12
aVAnd this woman is the star of the video.
p13
aVShe doesn't know she's being filmed.
p14
aVShe's being filmed with a hidden camera.
p15
aVThis is on the 6 train in New York City.
p16
aVAnd this is the first stop along the line.
p17
aVThese are two Danish guys
p18
aVwho come in and sit down next to the hidden camera.
p19
aVAnd that's me right there in a brown coat.
p20
aVIt's about 30 degrees outside.
p21
aVI'm wearing a hat. I'm wearing a scarf.
p22
aVAnd the girl's going to notice me right here.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd as you'll see now, I'm not wearing pants.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VAt this point \u2014
p31
aVat this point she's noticed me,
p32
aVbut in New York there's weirdos on any given train car.
p33
aVOne person's not that unusual.
p34
aVShe goes back to reading her book, which is unfortunately titled "Rape."
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VSo she's noticed the unusual thing, but she's gone back to her normal life.
p39
aa(lp40
VNow, in the meantime, I have six friends
p41
aVwho are waiting at the next six consecutive stops
p42
aVin their underwear as well.
p43
aVThey're going to be entering this car one by one.
p44
aVWe'll act as though we don't know each other.
p45
aVAnd we'll act as if it's just an unfortunate mistake we've made,
p46
aVforgetting our pants on this cold January day.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter continues)
p51
aa(lp52
VSo at this point,
p53
aVshe decides to put the rape book away.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd she decides to be a little bit more aware of her surroundings.
p58
aVIn the meantime, the two Danish guys to the left of the camera,
p59
aVthey're cracking up.
p60
aVThey think this is the funniest thing they've ever seen before.
p61
aVAnd watch her make eye contact with them right about now.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd I love that moment in this video,
p66
aVbecause before it became a shared experience,
p67
aVit was something that was maybe a little bit scary,
p68
aVor something that was at least confusing to her.
p69
aVAnd then, once it became a shared experience,
p70
aVit was funny and something that she could laugh at.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo the train is now pulling into the third stop along the 6 line.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VSo the video won't show everything.
p77
aVThis goes on for another four stops.
p78
aVA total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear.
p79
aVAt the eighth stop, a girl came in with a giant duffel bag
p80
aVand announced she had pants for sale for a dollar \u2014
p81
aVlike you might sell batteries or candy on the train.
p82
aVWe all very matter-of-factly bought a pair of pants, put them on
p83
aVand said, "Thank you. That's exactly what I needed today,"
p84
aVand then exited without revealing what had happened
p85
aVand went in all different directions.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Applause)
p88
aa(lp89
VThank you.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo that's a still from the video there.
p92
aVAnd I love that girl's reaction so much.
p93
aVAnd watching that videotape later that day
p94
aVinspired me to keep doing what I do.
p95
aVAnd really one of the points of Improv Everywhere
p96
aVis to cause a scene in a public place
p97
aVthat is a positive experience for other people.
p98
aVIt's a prank, but it's a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell.
p99
aVAnd her reaction inspired me
p100
aVto do a second annual No Pants Subway Ride.
p101
aVAnd we've continued to do it every year.
p102
aVThis January, we did the 10th annual No Pants Subway Ride
p103
aVwhere a diverse group of 3,500 people
p104
aVrode the train in their underwear in New York \u2014
p105
aValmost every single train line in the city.
p106
aVAnd also in 50 other cities around the world,
p107
aVpeople participated.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VAs I started taking improv class at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater
p112
aVand meeting other creative people and other performers and comedians,
p113
aVI started amassing a mailing list of people
p114
aVwho wanted to do these types of projects.
p115
aVSo I could do more large-scale projects.
p116
aVWell, one day I was walking through Union Square,
p117
aVand I saw this building, which had just been built in 2005.
p118
aVThere was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing.
p119
aVIt was very peculiar, because it was dark out,
p120
aVbut she was backlit with florescent lighting.
p121
aVShe was very much onstage
p122
aVand I couldn't figure out why she was doing it.
p123
aVAfter about 15 seconds, her friend appeared \u2014
p124
aVshe had been hiding behind a display.
p125
aVThey laughed, hugged each other and ran away.
p126
aVMaybe she had been dared to do this.
p127
aVSo I got inspired by that.
p128
aVLooking at the entire facade \u2014 there were 70 total windows \u2014
p129
aVand I knew what I had to do.
p130
aa(lp131
V(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
VSo this project is called Look Up More.
p134
aVWe had 70 actors dress in black.
p135
aVThis was completely unauthorized.
p136
aVWe didn't let the stores know we were coming.
p137
aVAnd I stood in the park giving signals.
p138
aVThe first signal was for everybody to hold up these four-foot tall letters
p139
aVthat spelled out "Look Up More,"
p140
aVthe name of the project.
p141
aVThe second signal was for everybody to do jumping jacks together.
p142
aVYou'll see that start right here.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd then we had dancing. We had everyone dance.
p147
aVAnd then we had dance solos
p148
aVwhere only one person would dance and everybody would point to them.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VSo then I gave a new hand signal,
p153
aVwhich signaled the next soloist down below in Forever 21,
p154
aVand he danced.
p155
aVThere were several other activities.
p156
aVWe had people jumping up and down, people dropping to the ground.
p157
aVAnd I was standing just anonymously in a sweatshirt,
p158
aVputting my hand on and off of a trashcan to signal the advancement.
p159
aVAnd because it was in Union Square Park, right by a subway station,
p160
aVthere were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up
p161
aVand watched what we were doing.
p162
aVThere's a better photo of it.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo that particular event was inspired by a moment
p165
aVthat I happened to stumble upon.
p166
aVThe next project I want to show
p167
aVwas given to me in an email from a stranger.
p168
aVA high school kid in Texas wrote me in 2006
p169
aVand said, "You should get as many people as possible
p170
aVto put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants
p171
aVand go into a Best Buy and stand around."
p172
aa(lp173
V(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
V(Applause)
p176
aa(lp177
VSo I wrote this high school kid back immediately
p178
aVand I said, "Yes, you are correct.
p179
aVI think I'll try to do that this weekend. Thank you."
p180
aVSo here's the video.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo again, this is 2005.
p183
aVThis is the Best Buy in New York City.
p184
aVWe had about 80 people show up to participate,
p185
aVentering one by one.
p186
aVThere was an eight-year-old girl, a 10-year-old girl.
p187
aVThere was also a 65-year-old man who participated.
p188
aVSo a very diverse group of people.
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd I told people, "Don't work. Don't actually do work.
p193
aVBut also, don't shop.
p194
aVJust stand around and don't face products."
p195
aVNow you can see the regular employees
p196
aVby the ones that have the yellow tags on their shirt.
p197
aVEverybody else is one of our actors.
p198
aa(lp199
V(Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
VThe lower-level employees thought it was very funny.
p202
aVSeveral of them went to go get their camera from the break room
p203
aVand took photos with us.
p204
aVA lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back
p205
aVto get heavy television sets for customers.
p206
aVThe managers and the security guards, on the other hand,
p207
aVdid not find it particularly funny.
p208
aVYou can see them in this footage.
p209
aVThey're wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt.
p210
aVAnd we were there probably 10 minutes
p211
aVbefore the managers decided to dial 911.
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
VSo they started running around
p216
aVtelling everybody the cops were coming, "Watch out, the cops are coming."
p217
aVAnd you can see the cops in this footage right here.
p218
aVThat's a cop wearing black right there, being filmed with a hidden camera.
p219
aVUltimately, the police had to inform Best Buy management
p220
aVthat it was not, in fact, illegal to wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
V(Applause)
p225
aa(lp226
VThank you.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Applause)
p229
aa(lp230
VSo we had been there for 20 minutes; we were happy to exit the store.
p231
aVOne thing the managers were trying to do was to track down our cameras.
p232
aVAnd they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags.
p233
aVBut the one camera guy they never caught
p234
aVwas the guy that went in just with a blank tape
p235
aVand went over to the Best Buy camera department
p236
aVand just put his tape in one of their cameras
p237
aVand pretended to shop.
p238
aVSo I like that concept of using their own technology against them.
p239
aa(lp240
V(Laughter)
p241
aa(lp242
VI think our best projects are ones that are site-specific
p243
aVand happen at a particular place for a reason.
p244
aVAnd one morning, I was riding the subway.
p245
aVI had to make a transfer at the 53rd St. stop
p246
aVwhere there are these two giant escalators.
p247
aVAnd it's a very depressing place to be in the morning, it's very crowded.
p248
aVSo I decided to try and stage something
p249
aVthat could make it as happy as possible for one morning.
p250
aVSo this was in the winter of 2009 \u2014 8:30 in the morning.
p251
aVIt's morning rush hour.
p252
aVIt's very cold outside.
p253
aVPeople are coming in from Queens,
p254
aVtransferring from the E train to the 6 train.
p255
aVAnd they're going up these giant escalators
p256
aVon their way to their jobs.
p257
aa(lp258
V[Rob wants]
p259
aV[to give you]
p260
aa(lp261
V(Laughter)
p262
aa(lp263
V[a high five!]
p264
aa(lp265
V(Laughter)
p266
aa(lp267
V[Get ready!]
p268
aa(lp269
V(Laughter)
p270
aa(lp271
V(Applause)
p272
aa(lp273
VThank you.
p274
aVSo there's a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better.
p275
aVHe gave 2,000 high fives that day,
p276
aVand he washed his hands before and afterward
p277
aVand did not get sick.
p278
aVAnd that was done also without permission,
p279
aValthough no one seemed to care.
p280
aa(lp281
VSo I'd say over the years,
p282
aVone of the most common criticisms I see of Improv Everywhere
p283
aVleft anonymously on YouTube comments
p284
aVis: "These people have too much time on their hands."
p285
aVAnd you know, not everybody's going to like everything you do,
p286
aVand I've certainly developed a thick skin thanks to Internet comments,
p287
aVbut that one's always bothered me,
p288
aVbecause we don't have too much time on our hands.
p289
aVThe participants in Improv Everywhere events
p290
aVhave just as much leisure time as any other New Yorkers,
p291
aVthey just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way.
p292
aa(lp293
VYou know, every Saturday and Sunday,
p294
aVhundreds of thousands of people each fall
p295
aVgather in football stadiums to watch games.
p296
aVAnd I've never seen anybody comment, looking at a football game,
p297
aV"All those people in the stands, they have too much time on their hands."
p298
aVAnd of course they don't.
p299
aVIt's a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon,
p300
aVwatching a football game in a stadium.
p301
aVBut I think it's also a perfectly valid way
p302
aVto spend an afternoon freezing in place with 200 people
p303
aVin the Grand Central terminal
p304
aVor dressing up like a ghostbuster
p305
aVand running through the New York Public Library.
p306
aa(lp307
V(Laughter)
p308
aa(lp309
VOr listening to the same MP3 as 3,000 other people
p310
aVand dancing silently in a park,
p311
aVor bursting into song in a grocery store
p312
aVas part of a spontaneous musical,
p313
aVor diving into the ocean in Coney Island wearing formal attire.
p314
aa(lp315
V(Laughter)
p316
aa(lp317
VYou know, as kids, we're taught to play.
p318
aVAnd we're never given a reason why we should play.
p319
aVIt's just acceptable that play is a good thing.
p320
aVAnd I think that's sort of the point of Improv Everywhere.
p321
aVIt's that there is no point and that there doesn't have to be a point.
p322
aVWe don't need a reason. As long as it's fun
p323
aVand it seems like it's going to be a funny idea
p324
aVand it seems like the people who witness it
p325
aVwill also have a fun time,
p326
aVthen that's enough for us.
p327
aVAnd I think, as adults, we need to learn
p328
aVthat there's no right or wrong way to play.
p329
aa(lp330
VThank you very much.
p331
aa(lp332
V(Applause)

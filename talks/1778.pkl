VGood morning.
p5
aVMy name is Eric Li, and I was born here.
p6
aVBut no, I wasn't born there.
p7
aVThis was where I was born:
p8
aVShanghai, at the height of the Cultural Revolution.
p9
aVMy grandmother tells me that she heard
p10
aVthe sound of gunfire along with my first cries.
p11
aVWhen I was growing up, I was told a story
p12
aVthat explained all I ever needed to know about humanity.
p13
aVIt went like this.
p14
aVAll human societies develop in linear progression,
p15
aVbeginning with primitive society, then slave society,
p16
aVfeudalism, capitalism, socialism,
p17
aVand finally, guess where we end up?
p18
aVCommunism!
p19
aVSooner or later, all of humanity,
p20
aVregardless of culture, language, nationality,
p21
aVwill arrive at this final stage
p22
aVof political and social development.
p23
aVThe entire world's peoples will be unified
p24
aVin this paradise on Earth
p25
aVand live happily ever after.
p26
aVBut before we get there, we're engaged
p27
aVin a struggle between good and evil,
p28
aVthe good of socialism against the evil of capitalism,
p29
aVand the good shall triumph.
p30
aVThat, of course, was the meta-narrative
p31
aVdistilled from the theories of Karl Marx.
p32
aVAnd the Chinese bought it.
p33
aVWe were taught that grand story day in and day out.
p34
aVIt became part of us, and we believed in it.
p35
aVThe story was a bestseller.
p36
aVAbout one third of the entire world's population
p37
aVlived under that meta-narrative.
p38
aVThen, the world changed overnight.
p39
aVAs for me, disillusioned by the failed religion of my youth,
p40
aVI went to America and became a Berkeley hippie.
p41
aV(Laughter)
p42
aVNow, as I was coming of age, something else happened.
p43
aVAs if one big story wasn't enough,
p44
aVI was told another one.
p45
aVThis one was just as grand.
p46
aVIt also claims that all human societies
p47
aVdevelop in a linear progression towards a singular end.
p48
aVThis one went as follows:
p49
aVAll societies, regardless of culture,
p50
aVbe it Christian, Muslim, Confucian,
p51
aVmust progress from traditional societies
p52
aVin which groups are the basic units
p53
aVto modern societies in which atomized individuals
p54
aVare the sovereign units,
p55
aVand all these individuals are, by definition, rational,
p56
aVand they all want one thing:
p57
aVthe vote.
p58
aVBecause they are all rational, once given the vote,
p59
aVthey produce good government
p60
aVand live happily ever after.
p61
aVParadise on Earth, again.
p62
aVSooner or later, electoral democracy will be
p63
aVthe only political system for all countries and all peoples,
p64
aVwith a free market to make them all rich.
p65
aVBut before we get there, we're engaged in a struggle
p66
aVbetween good and evil.
p67
aV(Laughter)
p68
aVThe good belongs to those who are democracies
p69
aVand are charged with a mission of spreading it
p70
aVaround the globe, sometimes by force,
p71
aVagainst the evil of those who do not hold elections.
p72
aV(Video) George H.W. Bush: A new world order...
p73
aV(Video) George W. Bush:... ending tyranny in our world...
p74
aV(Video) Barack Obama:... a single standard for all
p75
aVwho would hold power.
p76
aVEric X. Li: Now \u2014
p77
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p78
aVThis story also became a bestseller.
p79
aVAccording to Freedom House,
p80
aVthe number of democracies went from 45 in 1970
p81
aVto 115 in 2010.
p82
aVIn the last 20 years, Western elites tirelessly
p83
aVtrotted around the globe selling this prospectus:
p84
aVMultiple parties fight for political power
p85
aVand everyone voting on them
p86
aVis the only path to salvation
p87
aVto the long-suffering developing world.
p88
aVThose who buy the prospectus are destined for success.
p89
aVThose who do not are doomed to fail.
p90
aVBut this time, the Chinese didn't buy it.
p91
aVFool me once...
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aVThe rest is history.
p94
aVIn just 30 years, China went from
p95
aVone of the poorest agricultural countries in the world
p96
aVto its second-largest economy.
p97
aVSix hundred fifty million people
p98
aVwere lifted out of poverty.
p99
aVEighty percent of the entire world's poverty alleviation
p100
aVduring that period happened in China.
p101
aVIn other words, all the new and old democracies
p102
aVput together amounted to a mere fraction
p103
aVof what a single, one-party state did without voting.
p104
aVSee, I grew up on this stuff: food stamps.
p105
aVMeat was rationed to a few hundred grams
p106
aVper person per month at one point.
p107
aVNeedless to say, I ate all my grandmother's portions.
p108
aVSo I asked myself, what's wrong with this picture?
p109
aVHere I am in my hometown,
p110
aVmy business growing leaps and bounds.
p111
aVEntrepreneurs are starting companies every day.
p112
aVMiddle class is expanding in speed and scale
p113
aVunprecedented in human history.
p114
aVYet, according to the grand story,
p115
aVnone of this should be happening.
p116
aVSo I went and did the only thing I could. I studied it.
p117
aVYes, China is a one-party state
p118
aVrun by the Chinese Communist Party, the Party,
p119
aVand they don't hold elections.
p120
aVThree assumptions are made
p121
aVby the dominant political theories of our time.
p122
aVSuch a system is operationally rigid,
p123
aVpolitically closed, and morally illegitimate.
p124
aVWell, the assumptions are wrong.
p125
aVThe opposites are true.
p126
aVAdaptability, meritocracy, and legitimacy
p127
aVare the three defining characteristics
p128
aVof China's one-party system.
p129
aVNow, most political scientists will tell us
p130
aVthat a one-party system is inherently incapable
p131
aVof self-correction.
p132
aVIt won't last long because it cannot adapt.
p133
aVNow here are the facts.
p134
aVIn 64 years of running the largest country in the world,
p135
aVthe range of the Party's policies has been wider
p136
aVthan any other country in recent memory,
p137
aVfrom radical land collectivization to the Great Leap Forward,
p138
aVthen privatization of farmland,
p139
aVthen the Cultural Revolution,
p140
aVthen Deng Xiaoping's market reform,
p141
aVthen successor Jiang Zemin took the giant political step
p142
aVof opening up Party membership to private businesspeople,
p143
aVsomething unimaginable during Mao's rule.
p144
aVSo the Party self-corrects in rather dramatic fashions.
p145
aVInstitutionally, new rules get enacted
p146
aVto correct previous dysfunctions.
p147
aVFor example, term limits.
p148
aVPolitical leaders used to retain their positions for life,
p149
aVand they used that to accumulate power
p150
aVand perpetuate their rules.
p151
aVMao was the father of modern China,
p152
aVyet his prolonged rule led to disastrous mistakes.
p153
aVSo the Party instituted term limits
p154
aVwith mandatory retirement age of 68 to 70.
p155
aVOne thing we often hear is,
p156
aV"Political reforms have lagged far behind economic reforms,"
p157
aVand "China is in dire need of political reform."
p158
aVBut this claim is a rhetorical trap
p159
aVhidden behind a political bias.
p160
aVSee, some have decided a priori
p161
aVwhat kinds of changes they want to see,
p162
aVand only such changes can be called political reform.
p163
aVThe truth is, political reforms have never stopped.
p164
aVCompared with 30 years ago, 20 years, even 10 years ago,
p165
aVevery aspect of Chinese society,
p166
aVhow the country is governed,
p167
aVfrom the most local level to the highest center,
p168
aVare unrecognizable today.
p169
aVNow such changes are simply not possible
p170
aVwithout political reforms of the most fundamental kind.
p171
aVNow I would venture to suggest the Party
p172
aVis the world's leading expert in political reform.
p173
aVThe second assumption is that in a one-party state,
p174
aVpower gets concentrated in the hands of the few,
p175
aVand bad governance and corruption follow.
p176
aVIndeed, corruption is a big problem,
p177
aVbut let's first look at the larger context.
p178
aVNow, this may be counterintuitive to you.
p179
aVThe Party happens to be one of the most meritocratic
p180
aVpolitical institutions in the world today.
p181
aVChina's highest ruling body, the Politburo, has 25 members.
p182
aVIn the most recent one, only five of them
p183
aVcame from a background of privilege, so-called princelings.
p184
aVThe other 20, including the president and the premier,
p185
aVcame from entirely ordinary backgrounds.
p186
aVIn the larger central committee of 300 or more,
p187
aVthe percentage of those who were born
p188
aVinto power and wealth was even smaller.
p189
aVThe vast majority of senior Chinese leaders
p190
aVworked and competed their way to the top.
p191
aVCompare that with the ruling elites
p192
aVin both developed and developing countries,
p193
aVI think you'll find the Party being near the top
p194
aVin upward mobility.
p195
aVThe question then is, how could that be possible
p196
aVin a system run by one party?
p197
aVNow we come to a powerful political institution,
p198
aVlittle-known to Westerners:
p199
aVthe Party's Organization Department.
p200
aVThe department functions like a giant
p201
aVhuman resource engine that would be the envy
p202
aVof even some of the most successful corporations.
p203
aVIt operates a rotating pyramid
p204
aVmade up of three components:
p205
aVcivil service, state-owned enterprises,
p206
aVand social organizations like a university
p207
aVor a community program.
p208
aVThey form separate yet integrated career paths
p209
aVfor Chinese officials.
p210
aVThey recruit college grads into entry-level positions
p211
aVin all three tracks, and they start from the bottom,
p212
aVcalled "keyuan" [clerk].
p213
aVThen they could get promoted
p214
aVthrough four increasingly elite ranks:
p215
aVfuke [deputy section manager], ke [section manager], fuchu [deputy division manager], and chu [division manger].
p216
aVNow these are not moves from "Karate Kid," okay?
p217
aVIt's serious business.
p218
aVThe range of positions is wide,
p219
aVfrom running health care in a village
p220
aVto foreign investment in a city district
p221
aVto manager in a company.
p222
aVOnce a year, the department reviews their performance.
p223
aVThey interview their superiors, their peers,
p224
aVtheir subordinates. They vet their personal conduct.
p225
aVThey conduct public opinion surveys.
p226
aVThen they promote the winners.
p227
aVThroughout their careers, these cadres
p228
aVcan move through and out of all three tracks.
p229
aVOver time, the good ones move beyond the four base levels
p230
aVto the fuju [deputy bureau chief] and ju [bureau chief] levels.
p231
aVThere, they enter high officialdom.
p232
aVBy that point, a typical assignment will be
p233
aVto manage a district with a population in the millions
p234
aVor a company with hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.
p235
aVJust to show you how competitive the system is,
p236
aVin 2012, there were 900,000 fuke and ke levels,
p237
aV600,000 fuchu and chu levels,
p238
aVand only 40,000 fuju and ju levels.
p239
aVAfter the ju levels,
p240
aVthe best few move further up several more ranks,
p241
aVand eventually make it to the Central Committee.
p242
aVThe process takes two to three decades.
p243
aVDoes patronage play a role? Yes, of course.
p244
aVBut merit remains the fundamental driver.
p245
aVIn essence, the Organization Department runs
p246
aVa modernized version of China's centuries-old
p247
aVmentoring system.
p248
aVChina's new president, Xi Jinping,
p249
aVis the son of a former leader, which is very unusual,
p250
aVfirst of his kind to make the top job.
p251
aVEven for him, the career took 30 years.
p252
aVHe started as a village manager,
p253
aVand by the time he entered the Politburo,
p254
aVhe had managed areas with a total population
p255
aVof 150 million people
p256
aVand combined GDPs of 1.5 trillion U.S. dollars.
p257
aVNow, please don't get me wrong, okay?
p258
aVThis is not a put-down of anyone. It's just a statement of fact.
p259
aVGeorge W. Bush, remember him?
p260
aVThis is not a put-down.
p261
aV(Laughter)
p262
aVBefore becoming governor of Texas,
p263
aVor Barack Obama before running for president,
p264
aVcould not make even a small county manager
p265
aVin China's system.
p266
aVWinston Churchill once said that democracy
p267
aVis a terrible system except for all the rest.
p268
aVWell, apparently he hadn't heard of the Organization Department.
p269
aVNow, Westerners always assume that
p270
aVmulti-party election with universal suffrage
p271
aVis the only source of political legitimacy.
p272
aVI was asked once, "The Party wasn't voted in by election.
p273
aVWhere is the source of legitimacy?"
p274
aVI said, "How about competency?"
p275
aVWe all know the facts.
p276
aVIn 1949, when the Party took power,
p277
aVChina was mired in civil wars, dismembered by foreign aggression,
p278
aVaverage life expectancy at that time, 41 years old.
p279
aVToday, it's the second largest economy in the world,
p280
aVan industrial powerhouse, and its people live
p281
aVin increasing prosperity.
p282
aVPew Research polls Chinese public attitudes,
p283
aVand here are the numbers in recent years.
p284
aVSatisfaction with the direction of the country: 85 percent.
p285
aVThose who think they're better off than five years ago:
p286
aV70 percent.
p287
aVThose who expect the future to be better:
p288
aVa whopping 82 percent.
p289
aVFinancial Times polls global youth attitudes,
p290
aVand these numbers, brand new, just came from last week.
p291
aVNinety-three percent of China's Generation Y
p292
aVare optimistic about their country's future.
p293
aVNow, if this is not legitimacy, I'm not sure what is.
p294
aVIn contrast, most electoral democracies around the world
p295
aVare suffering from dismal performance.
p296
aVI don't need to elaborate for this audience
p297
aVhow dysfunctional it is, from Washington to European capitals.
p298
aVWith a few exceptions, the vast number
p299
aVof developing countries that have adopted electoral regimes
p300
aVare still suffering from poverty and civil strife.
p301
aVGovernments get elected, and then they fall
p302
aVbelow 50 percent approval in a few months
p303
aVand stay there and get worse until the next election.
p304
aVDemocracy is becoming a perpetual cycle
p305
aVof elect and regret.
p306
aVAt this rate, I'm afraid it is democracy,
p307
aVnot China's one-party system, that is in danger
p308
aVof losing legitimacy.
p309
aVNow, I don't want to create the misimpression
p310
aVthat China's hunky-dory, on the way
p311
aVto some kind of superpowerdom.
p312
aVThe country faces enormous challenges.
p313
aVThe social and economic problems that come
p314
aVwith wrenching change like this are mind-boggling.
p315
aVPollution is one. Food safety. Population issues.
p316
aVOn the political front, the worst problem is corruption.
p317
aVCorruption is widespread and undermines the system
p318
aVand its moral legitimacy.
p319
aVBut most analysts misdiagnose the disease.
p320
aVThey say that corruption is the result of the one-party system,
p321
aVand therefore, in order to cure it,
p322
aVyou have to do away with the entire system.
p323
aVBut a more careful look would tell us otherwise.
p324
aVTransparency International ranks China
p325
aVbetween 70 and 80 in recent years among 170 countries,
p326
aVand it's been moving up.
p327
aVIndia, the largest democracy in the world,
p328
aV94 and dropping.
p329
aVFor the hundred or so countries that are ranked below China,
p330
aVmore than half of them are electoral democracies.
p331
aVSo if election is the panacea for corruption,
p332
aVhow come these countries can't fix it?
p333
aVNow, I'm a venture capitalist. I make bets.
p334
aVIt wouldn't be fair to end this talk without
p335
aVputting myself on the line and making some predictions.
p336
aVSo here they are.
p337
aVIn the next 10 years, China will surpass the U.S.
p338
aVand become the largest economy in the world.
p339
aVIncome per capita will be near the top
p340
aVof all developing countries.
p341
aVCorruption will be curbed, but not eliminated,
p342
aVand China will move up 10 to 20 notches
p343
aVto above 60 in T.I. ranking.
p344
aVEconomic reform will accelerate, political reform will continue,
p345
aVand the one-party system will hold firm.
p346
aVWe live in the dusk of an era.
p347
aVMeta-narratives that make universal claims
p348
aVfailed us in the 20th century
p349
aVand are failing us in the 21st.
p350
aVMeta-narrative is the cancer
p351
aVthat is killing democracy from the inside.
p352
aVNow, I want to clarify something.
p353
aVI'm not here to make an indictment of democracy.
p354
aVOn the contrary, I think democracy contributed
p355
aVto the rise of the West and the creation of the modern world.
p356
aVIt is the universal claim that many Western elites
p357
aVare making about their political system, the hubris,
p358
aVthat is at the heart of the West's current ills.
p359
aVIf they would spend just a little less time
p360
aVon trying to force their way onto others,
p361
aVand a little bit more on political reform at home,
p362
aVthey might give their democracy a better chance.
p363
aVChina's political model will never supplant
p364
aVelectoral democracy, because unlike the latter,
p365
aVit doesn't pretend to be universal.
p366
aVIt cannot be exported. But that is the point precisely.
p367
aVThe significance of China's example
p368
aVis not that it provides an alternative,
p369
aVbut the demonstration that alternatives exist.
p370
aVLet us draw to a close this era of meta-narratives.
p371
aVCommunism and democracy may both be laudable ideals,
p372
aVbut the era of their dogmatic universalism is over.
p373
aVLet us stop telling people and our children
p374
aVthere's only one way to govern ourselves
p375
aVand a singular future towards which
p376
aVall societies must evolve.
p377
aVIt is wrong. It is irresponsible.
p378
aVAnd worst of all, it is boring.
p379
aVLet universality make way for plurality.
p380
aVPerhaps a more interesting age is upon us.
p381
aVAre we brave enough to welcome it?
p382
aVThank you.
p383
aV(Applause)
p384
aVThank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks.
p385
aVBruno Giussani: Eric, stay with me for a couple of minutes,
p386
aVbecause I want to ask you a couple of questions.
p387
aVI think many here, and in general in Western countries,
p388
aVwould agree with your statement about analysis
p389
aVof democratic systems becoming dysfunctional,
p390
aVbut at the same time, many would kind of find
p391
aVunsettling the thought that there is an unelected
p392
aVauthority that, without any form of oversight or consultation,
p393
aVdecides what the national interest is.
p394
aVWhat is the mechanism in the Chinese model
p395
aVthat allows people to say, actually,
p396
aVthe national interest as you defined it is wrong?
p397
aVEXL: You know, Frank Fukuyama, the political scientist,
p398
aVcalled the Chinese system "responsive authoritarianism."
p399
aVIt's not exactly right, but I think it comes close.
p400
aVSo I know the largest public opinion survey company
p401
aVin China, okay?
p402
aVDo you know who their biggest client is?
p403
aVThe Chinese government.
p404
aVNot just from the central government,
p405
aVthe city government, the provincial government,
p406
aVto the most local neighborhood districts.
p407
aVThey conduct surveys all the time.
p408
aVAre you happy with the garbage collection?
p409
aVAre you happy with the general direction of the country?
p410
aVSo there is, in China, there is a different kind of mechanism
p411
aVto be responsive to the demands and the thinking of the people.
p412
aVMy point is, I think we should get unstuck
p413
aVfrom the thinking that there's only one political system \u2014
p414
aVelection, election, election \u2014
p415
aVthat could make it responsive.
p416
aVI'm not sure, actually, elections produce
p417
aVresponsive government anymore in the world.
p418
aV(Applause)
p419
aVBG: Many seem to agree.
p420
aVOne of the features of a democratic system
p421
aVis a space for civil society to express itself.
p422
aVAnd you have shown figures about the support
p423
aVthat the government and the authorities have in China.
p424
aVBut then you've just mentioned other elements
p425
aVlike, you know, big challenges, and there are, of course,
p426
aVa lot of other data that go in a different direction:
p427
aVtens of thousands of unrests and protests
p428
aVand environmental protests, etc.
p429
aVSo you seem to suggest the Chinese model
p430
aVdoesn't have a space outside of the Party
p431
aVfor civil society to express itself.
p432
aVEXL: There's a vibrant civil society in China,
p433
aVwhether it's environment or what-have-you.
p434
aVBut it's different. You wouldn't recognize it.
p435
aVBecause, by Western definitions, a so-called civil society
p436
aVhas to be separate or even in opposition
p437
aVto the political system,
p438
aVbut that concept is alien for Chinese culture.
p439
aVFor thousands of years, you have civil society,
p440
aVyet they are consistent and coherent
p441
aVand part of a political order, and I think
p442
aVit's a big cultural difference.

Li studied in America (and even worked for Ross Perot&#39;s 1992 presidential campaign) before returning home, where he started doubting the idea that China&#39;s progress could only follow the path of the West&#39;s free-market principles.<br />&nbsp;<br />In a much-discussed op-ed he wrote for the<em> New York Times </em>in February 2012 and in other writings, he has put forth the idea that China needed a different development framework, around a different idea of modernity. The Chinese system, he says, is meritocratic, highly adaptable despite the one-party rule, long term-oriented, pragmatic and non-individualistic.

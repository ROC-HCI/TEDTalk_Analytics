VSustainability represents
p5
aVthe what, the where and the how
p6
aVof what is caught.
p7
aVThe who and the why are what's important to me.
p8
aVI want to know the people behind my dinner choices.
p9
aVI want to know how I impact them.
p10
aVI want to know how they impact me.
p11
aVI want to know why they fish.
p12
aVI want to know how they rely on the water's bounty
p13
aVfor their living.
p14
aVUnderstanding all of this enables us
p15
aVto shift our perception of seafood
p16
aVaway from a commodity
p17
aVto an opportunity
p18
aVto restore our ecosystem.
p19
aVIt allows for us to celebrate the seafood
p20
aVthat we're also so fortunate to eat.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo what do we call this?
p23
aVI think we call it restorative seafood.
p24
aVWhere sustainability is the capacity
p25
aVto endure and maintain,
p26
aVrestorative is the ability to replenish and progress.
p27
aVRestorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system
p28
aVand acknowledges our relationship with the ocean
p29
aVas a resource,
p30
aVsuggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean
p31
aVand to encourage its resiliency.
p32
aVIt is a more hopeful, it is a more human,
p33
aVand is a more useful way of understanding our environment.
p34
aa(lp35
VWallet guides \u2014 standard issue
p36
aVby lots in the marine conservation world \u2014
p37
aVare very handy; they're a wonderful tool.
p38
aVGreen, yellow and red lists [of] seafood species.
p39
aVThe association is very easy: buy green, don't buy red,
p40
aVthink twice about yellow.
p41
aVBut in my mind, it's really not enough
p42
aVto just eat green list.
p43
aVWe can't sustain this without the measure of our success
p44
aVreally changing the fate of the species
p45
aVin the yellow and the red.
p46
aVBut what if we eat only in the green list?
p47
aVYou've got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here \u2014
p48
aVcomes from sustainable stocks.
p49
aVPole caught \u2014 no bycatch.
p50
aVGreat for fishermen. Lots of money. Supporting local economies.
p51
aVBut it's a lion of the sea. It's a top predator.
p52
aa(lp53
VWhat's the context of this meal?
p54
aVAm I sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16-ounce portion of this?
p55
aVDo I do this three times a week?
p56
aVI might still be in the green list,
p57
aVbut I'm not doing myself, or you,
p58
aVor the oceans any favors.
p59
aVThe point is that we have to have a context,
p60
aVa gauge for our actions in all this.
p61
aVExample: I've heard that red wine is great for my health \u2014
p62
aVantioxidants and minerals \u2014 heart healthy.
p63
aVThat's great! I love red wine!
p64
aVI'm going to drink so much of it. I'm going to be so healthy.
p65
aVWell, how many bottles is it
p66
aVbefore you tell me that I have a problem?
p67
aVWell folks, we have a protein problem.
p68
aVWe have lost this sensibility
p69
aVwhen it regards our food,
p70
aVand we are paying a cost.
p71
aVThe problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves.
p72
aVWe are hiding that cost
p73
aVbehind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines.
p74
aVAnd we are hiding that cost behind monster profits.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood
p77
aVis that it really takes into account our needs.
p78
aVRestorative seafood might best be represented
p79
aVnot by Jaws, or by Flipper, or the Gordon's fisherman,
p80
aVbut rather, by the Jolly Green Giant.
p81
aVVegetables:
p82
aVthey might yet save the oceans.
p83
aVSylvia likes to say that blue is the new green.
p84
aVWell I'd like to respectfully submit
p85
aVthat broccoli green might then be the new blue.
p86
aVWe must continue to eat
p87
aVthe best seafood possible, if at all.
p88
aVBut we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables.
p89
aVThe best part about restorative seafood though
p90
aVis that it comes on the half-shell
p91
aVwith a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges.
p92
aVIt comes in a five-ounce portion of tilapia
p93
aVbreaded with Dijon mustard and crispy, broiled breadcrumbs
p94
aVand a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf
p95
aVwith crunchy, grilled broccoli
p96
aVso soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside
p97
aVwith just a hint of chili flake.
p98
aVWhooo!
p99
aVThis is an easy sell.
p100
aVAnd the best part is all of those ingredients are available
p101
aVto every family at the neighborhood Walmart.
p102
aa(lp103
VJamie Oliver is campaigning
p104
aVto save America from the way we eat.
p105
aVSylvia is campaigning to save the oceans
p106
aVfrom the way we eat.
p107
aVThere's a pattern here.
p108
aVForget nuclear holocaust;
p109
aVit's the fork that we have to worry about.
p110
aVWe have ravaged our Earth
p111
aVand then used the food that we've sourced
p112
aVto handicap ourselves in more ways than one.
p113
aVSo I think we have this whole eating thing wrong.
p114
aVAnd so I think it's time
p115
aVwe change what we expect from our food.
p116
aVSustainability is complicated
p117
aVbut dinner is a reality that we all very much understand.
p118
aVSo let's start there.
p119
aa(lp120
VThere's been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems.
p121
aVDan Barber and Alice Waters
p122
aVare leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution.
p123
aVBut green foods often represent
p124
aVa way for us to disregard
p125
aVthe responsibility as eaters.
p126
aVJust because it comes from a green source
p127
aVdoesn't mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate.
p128
aVWe have eco-friendly shrimp.
p129
aVWe can make them; we have that technology.
p130
aVBut we can never have any eco-friendly all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet.
p131
aVIt doesn't work.
p132
aVHeart-healthy dinner is a very important part
p133
aVof restorative seafood.
p134
aVWhile we try to manage declining marine populations,
p135
aVthe media's recommending increased consumption of seafood.
p136
aVStudies say that tens of thousands
p137
aVof American grandmothers, grandfathers, mothers and fathers
p138
aVmight be around for another birthday
p139
aVif we included more seafood.
p140
aVThat's a reward I am not willing to pass up.
p141
aVBut it's not all about the seafood.
p142
aVIt's about the way that we look at our plates.
p143
aa(lp144
VAs a chef, I realize the easiest thing for me to do
p145
aVis reduce the portion sizes on my plate.
p146
aVA couple things happened.
p147
aVI made more money.
p148
aVPeople started buying appetizers and salads,
p149
aVbecause they knew they weren't going to fill up on the entrees alone.
p150
aVPeople spent more time engaging in their meals,
p151
aVengaging with each other over their meals.
p152
aVPeople got, in short, more of what they came there for
p153
aVeven though they got less protein.
p154
aVThey got more calories over the course of a diversified meal.
p155
aVThey got healthier. I made more money.
p156
aVThis is great.
p157
aVEnvironmental consideration was served with every plate,
p158
aVbut it was served with a heaping mound
p159
aVof consideration for human interests at the same time.
p160
aa(lp161
VOne of the other things we did
p162
aVwas begin to diversify the species that we served \u2014
p163
aVsmall silverfish, anchovies, mackerel, sardines were uncommon.
p164
aVShellfish, mussels, oysters,
p165
aVclams, tilapia, char \u2014 these were the common species.
p166
aVWe were directing tastes
p167
aVtowards more resilience, more restorative options.
p168
aVThis is what we need to favor.
p169
aVThis is what the green list says.
p170
aVBut this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment.
p171
aa(lp172
VBut what of those big predators,
p173
aVthose fashionable species,
p174
aVthat green list tuna that I was talking about earlier?
p175
aVWell, if you must, I have a recipe for you.
p176
aVIt pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean,
p177
aVso here we go.
p178
aVStart with a 16-ounce portion of big fish.
p179
aVGet a knife. Cut it into four portions.
p180
aVPut it on four plates.
p181
aVMound up those four plates with vegetables
p182
aVand then open up the very best bottle of Burgundy you have,
p183
aVlight the candles and celebrate it.
p184
aVCelebrate the opportunity you have to eat this.
p185
aVInvite your friends and neighbors over
p186
aVand repeat once a year,
p187
aVmaybe.
p188
aa(lp189
VI expect a lot from food.
p190
aVI expect health
p191
aVand joy and family and community.
p192
aVI expect that producing ingredients,
p193
aVpreparing dishes and eating meals
p194
aVis all part of the communion of human interests.
p195
aVI was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook.
p196
aVAnd he taught me very early on
p197
aVabout the privilege that eating represents.
p198
aVI remember well the meals of my childhood.
p199
aVThey were reasonable portions of protein
p200
aVserved with copious quantities of vegetables
p201
aVand small amounts of starch, usually rice.
p202
aVThis is still how I largely eat today.
p203
aVI get sick when I go to steakhouses.
p204
aVI get the meat sweats.
p205
aVIt's like a hangover from protein.
p206
aVIt's disgusting.
p207
aVBut of all the dire news that you'll hear
p208
aVand that you have heard about the state of our oceans,
p209
aVI have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you
p210
aVpossibly the very worst of it
p211
aVand that is this whole time
p212
aVyour mother was right.
p213
aVEat your vegetables.
p214
aVIt's pretty straightforward.
p215
aa(lp216
VSo what are we looking for in a meal?
p217
aVWell for health, I'm looking for wholesome ingredients
p218
aVthat are good for my body.
p219
aVFor joy, I'm looking for butter and salt
p220
aVand sexy things that make things taste less like penance.
p221
aVFor family, I'm looking for recipes
p222
aVthat genuflect to my own personal histories.
p223
aVFor community though, we start at the very beginning.
p224
aVThere's no escaping the fact
p225
aVthat everything we eat has a global impact.
p226
aVSo try and learn as best you can what that impact is
p227
aVand then take the first step to minimize it.
p228
aVWe've seen an image of our blue planet,
p229
aVour world bank.
p230
aVBut it is more than just a repository of our resources;
p231
aVit's also the global geography
p232
aVof the communion we call dinner.
p233
aVSo if we all take only what we need,
p234
aVthen we can begin to share the rest,
p235
aVwe can begin to celebrate,
p236
aVwe can begin to restore.
p237
aVWe need to savor vegetables.
p238
aVWe need to savor smaller portions of seafood.
p239
aVAnd we need to save dinner.
p240
aa(lp241
VThank you.

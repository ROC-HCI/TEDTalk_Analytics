VWhat I'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter,
p5
aVand actually all the way down into the sewer
p6
aVbecause I want to talk about diarrhea.
p7
aVAnd in particular, I want to talk about
p8
aVthe design of diarrhea.
p9
aVAnd when evolutionary biologists talk about design,
p10
aVthey really mean design by natural selection.
p11
aVAnd that brings me to the title of the talk,
p12
aV"Using Evolution to Design Disease Organisms Intelligently."
p13
aVAnd I also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this.
p14
aVBut I'm not just doing this to be cute.
p15
aVI really think that this subtitle explains
p16
aVwhat somebody like me, who's sort of a Darwin wannabe,
p17
aVhow they actually look at one's role in
p18
aVsort of coming into this field of health sciences and medicine.
p19
aVIt's really not a very friendly field for evolutionary biologists.
p20
aVYou actually see a great potential,
p21
aVbut you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf,
p22
aVand may actually be very resistant, when one tries
p23
aVto introduce ideas.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo, all of the talk today is going to deal with two general questions.
p26
aVOne is that, why are some disease organisms more harmful?
p27
aVAnd a very closely related question, which is,
p28
aVhow can we take control of this situation once we understand
p29
aVthe answer to the first question?
p30
aVHow can we make the harmful organisms more mild?
p31
aVAnd I'm going to be talking, to begin with, as I said,
p32
aVabout diarrheal disease organisms.
p33
aVAnd the focus when I'm talking about the diarrheal organisms,
p34
aVas well as the focus when I'm talking about any organisms
p35
aVthat cause acute infectious disease,
p36
aVis to think about the problem from a germ's point of view,
p37
aVgerm's-eye view.
p38
aVAnd in particular, to think about a fundamental idea
p39
aVwhich I think makes sense out of a tremendous amount of variation
p40
aVin the harmfulness of disease organisms.
p41
aVAnd that idea is that from the germ's-eye point of view,
p42
aVdisease organisms have to get from one host to another,
p43
aVand often they have to rely on the well-being of the host
p44
aVto move them to another host.
p45
aa(lp46
VBut not always.
p47
aVSometimes, you get disease organisms
p48
aVthat don't rely on host mobility at all for transmission.
p49
aVAnd when you have that, then evolutionary theory tells us
p50
aVthat natural selection will favor the more exploitative,
p51
aVmore predator-like organisms.
p52
aVSo, natural selection will favor organisms
p53
aVthat are more likely to cause damage.
p54
aVIf instead transmission to another host requires host mobility,
p55
aVthen we expect that the winners of the competition
p56
aVwill be the milder organisms.
p57
aVSo, if the pathogen doesn't need the host to be healthy and active,
p58
aVand actual selection favors pathogens
p59
aVthat take advantage of those hosts,
p60
aVthe winners in the competition are those that exploit the hosts
p61
aVfor their own reproductive success.
p62
aVBut if the host needs to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen,
p63
aVthen it's the benign ones that tend to be the winners.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo, I'm going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases.
p66
aVDiarrheal disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways.
p67
aVThey can be transmitted from person-to-person contact,
p68
aVperson-to-food-then-to-person contact,
p69
aVwhen somebody eats contaminated food,
p70
aVor they can be transmitted through the water.
p71
aVAnd when they're transmitted through the water,
p72
aVunlike the first two modes of transmission,
p73
aVthese pathogens don't rely on a healthy host for transmission.
p74
aVA person can be sick in bed and still infect tens, even hundreds
p75
aVof other individuals.
p76
aVTo sort of illustrate that, this diagram emphasizes that
p77
aVif you've got a sick person in bed,
p78
aVsomebody's going to be taking out the contaminated materials.
p79
aVThey're going to wash those contaminated materials,
p80
aVand then the water may move into sources of drinking water.
p81
aVPeople will come in to those places where you've got
p82
aVcontaminated drinking water,
p83
aVbring things back to the family,
p84
aVmay drink right at that point.
p85
aVThe whole point is that a person who can't move
p86
aVcan still infect many other individuals.
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd so, the theory tells us that
p89
aVwhen diarrheal disease organisms are transported by water,
p90
aVwe expect them to be more predator-like, more harmful.
p91
aVAnd you can test these ideas.
p92
aVSo, one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria,
p93
aVand see whether or not the ones that tend to be
p94
aVmore transmitted by water, tend to be more harmful.
p95
aVAnd the answer is \u2014 yep, they are.
p96
aVNow I put those names in there just for the bacteria buffs,
p97
aVbut the main point here is that \u2014
p98
aV(Laughter)
p99
aVthere's a lot of them here, I can tell \u2014
p100
aVthe main point here is that those data points
p101
aVall show a very strong, positive association between
p102
aVthe degree to which a disease organism is transmitted by water,
p103
aVand how harmful they are,
p104
aVhow much death they cause per untreated infection.
p105
aVSo this suggests we're on the right track.
p106
aVBut this, to me, suggests that we really need
p107
aVto ask some additional questions.
p108
aa(lp109
VRemember the second question that I raised at the outset was,
p110
aVhow can we use this knowledge
p111
aVto make disease organisms evolve to be mild?
p112
aVNow, this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission,
p113
aVyou could cause disease organisms to shift from
p114
aVthe right-hand side of that graph to the left-hand side of the graph.
p115
aVBut it doesn't tell you how long.
p116
aVI mean, if this would require thousands of years,
p117
aVthen it's worthless in terms of controlling of these pathogens.
p118
aVBut if it could occur in just a few years,
p119
aVthen it might be a very important way to control
p120
aVsome of the nasty problems that we haven't been able to control.
p121
aVIn other words, this suggests that we could
p122
aVdomesticate these organisms.
p123
aVWe could make them evolve to be not so harmful to us.
p124
aa(lp125
VAnd so, as I was thinking about this, I focused on this organism,
p126
aVwhich is the El Tor biotype of the organism called Vibrio cholerae.
p127
aVAnd that is the species of organism that is responsible
p128
aVfor causing cholera.
p129
aVAnd the reason I thought this is a really great organism to look at
p130
aVis that we understand why it's so harmful.
p131
aVIt's harmful because it produces a toxin,
p132
aVand that toxin is released when the organism
p133
aVgets into our intestinal tract.
p134
aVIt causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine
p135
aVinto the lumen, the internal chamber of our intestine,
p136
aVand then that fluid goes the only way it can, which is out the other end.
p137
aVAnd it flushes out thousands of different other competitors
p138
aVthat would otherwise make life difficult for the Vibrios.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo what happens, if you've got an organism,
p141
aVit produces a lot of toxin.
p142
aVAfter a few days of infection you end up having \u2014
p143
aVthe fecal material really isn't so disgusting as we might imagine.
p144
aVIt's sort of cloudy water.
p145
aVAnd if you took a drop of that water,
p146
aVyou might find a million diarrheal organisms.
p147
aVIf the organism produced a lot of toxin,
p148
aVyou might find 10 million, or 100 million.
p149
aVIf it didn't produce a lot of this toxin,
p150
aVthen you might find a smaller number.
p151
aVSo the task is to try to figure out
p152
aVhow to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this
p153
aVto evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission,
p154
aVthereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted
p155
aVby person-to-person contact,
p156
aVor person-food-person contact \u2014
p157
aVboth of which would really require that people be
p158
aVmobile and fairly healthy for transmission.
p159
aa(lp160
VNow, I can think of some possible experiments.
p161
aVOne would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism \u2014
p162
aVsome that produce a lot of toxins, some that produce a little \u2014
p163
aVand take those strains and spew them out in different countries.
p164
aVSome countries that might have clean water supplies,
p165
aVso that you can't get waterborne transmission:
p166
aVyou expect the organism to evolve to mildness there.
p167
aVOther countries, in which you've got a lot of waterborne transmission,
p168
aVthere you expect these organisms to evolve
p169
aVtowards a high level of harmfulness, right?
p170
aVThere's a little ethical problem in this experiment.
p171
aVI was hoping to hear a few gasps at least.
p172
aVThat makes me worry a little bit.
p173
aa(lp174
V(Laughter)
p175
aa(lp176
VBut anyhow, the laughter makes me feel a little bit better.
p177
aVAnd this ethical problem's a big problem.
p178
aVJust to emphasize this, this is what we're really talking about.
p179
aVHere's a girl who's almost dead.
p180
aVShe got rehydration therapy, she perked up,
p181
aVwithin a few days she was looking like a completely different person.
p182
aVSo, we don't want to run an experiment like that.
p183
aVBut interestingly, just that thing happened in 1991.
p184
aVIn 1991, this cholera organism got into Lima, Peru,
p185
aVand within two months it had spread to the neighboring areas.
p186
aVNow, I don't know how that happened,
p187
aVand I didn't have anything to do with it, I promise you.
p188
aVI don't think anybody knows,
p189
aVbut I'm not averse to, once that's happened,
p190
aVto see whether or not the prediction that we would make,
p191
aVthat I did make before, actually holds up.
p192
aVDid the organism evolve to mildness in a place like Chile,
p193
aVwhich has some of the most well protected water supplies
p194
aVin Latin America?
p195
aVAnd did it evolve to be more harmful in a place like Ecuador,
p196
aVwhich has some of the least well protected?
p197
aVAnd Peru's got something sort of in between.
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd so, with funding from the Bosack-Kruger Foundation,
p200
aVI got a lot of strains from these different countries
p201
aVand we measured their toxin production in the lab.
p202
aVAnd we found that in Chile \u2014 within two months of the invasion of Peru
p203
aVyou had strains entering Chile \u2014
p204
aVand when you look at those strains,
p205
aVin the very far left-hand side of this graph,
p206
aVyou see a lot of variation in the toxin production.
p207
aVEach dot corresponds to an islet from a different person \u2014
p208
aVa lot of variation on which natural selection can act.
p209
aVBut the interesting point is, if you look over the 1990s,
p210
aVwithin a few years the organisms evolved to be more mild.
p211
aVThey evolved to produce less toxin.
p212
aVAnd to just give you a sense of how important this might be,
p213
aVif we look in 1995, we find that there's only one case of cholera,
p214
aVon average, reported from Chile every two years.
p215
aa(lp216
VSo, it's controlled.
p217
aVThat's how much we have in America,
p218
aVcholera that's acquired endemically,
p219
aVand we don't think we've got a problem here.
p220
aVThey didn't \u2014 they solved the problem in Chile.
p221
aVBut, before we get too confident, we'd better look at some of those other countries,
p222
aVand make sure that this organism doesn't just always evolve toward mildness.
p223
aVWell, in Peru it didn't.
p224
aVAnd in Ecuador \u2014 remember, this is the place where it has
p225
aVthe highest potential waterborne transmission \u2014
p226
aVit looked like it got more harmful.
p227
aVIn every case there's a lot of variation,
p228
aVbut something about the environment the people are living in,
p229
aVand I think the only realistic explanation is that it's
p230
aVthe degree of waterborne transmission,
p231
aVfavored the harmful strains in one place, and mild strains in another.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo, this is very encouraging,
p234
aVit suggests that something that we might want to do anyhow,
p235
aVif we had enough money, could actually give us a much bigger bang for the buck.
p236
aVIt would make these organisms evolve to mildness,
p237
aVso that even though people might be getting infected,
p238
aVthey'd be infected with mild strains.
p239
aVIt wouldn't be causing severe disease.
p240
aVBut there's another really interesting aspect of this,
p241
aVand this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence,
p242
aVevolution of harmfulness,
p243
aVthen you should be able to control antibiotic resistance.
p244
aVAnd the idea is very simple.
p245
aVIf you've got a harmful organism,
p246
aVa high proportion of the people are going to be symptomatic,
p247
aVa high proportion of the people are going to be going to get antibiotics.
p248
aVYou've got a lot of pressure favoring antibiotic resistance,
p249
aVso you get increased virulence leading to
p250
aVthe evolution of increased antibiotic resistance.
p251
aVAnd once you get increased antibiotic resistance,
p252
aVthe antibiotics aren't knocking out the harmful strains anymore.
p253
aVSo, you've got a higher level of virulence.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo, you get this vicious cycle.
p256
aVThe goal is to turn this around.
p257
aVIf you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence
p258
aVby cleaning up the water supply,
p259
aVyou should be able to get an evolutionary decrease
p260
aVin antibiotic resistance.
p261
aVSo, we can go to the same countries and look and see.
p262
aVDid Chile avoid the problem of antibiotic resistance,
p263
aVwhereas did Ecuador actually have the beginnings of the problem?
p264
aVIf we look in the beginning of the 1990s,
p265
aVwe see, again, a lot of variation.
p266
aVIn this case, on the Y-axis, we've just got a measure of antibiotic sensitivity \u2014
p267
aVand I won't go into that.
p268
aVBut we've got a lot of variation in antibiotic sensitivity in Chile,
p269
aVPeru and Ecuador, and no trend across the years.
p270
aVBut if we look at the end of the 1990s, just half a decade later,
p271
aVwe see that in Ecuador they started having a resistance problem.
p272
aVAntibiotic sensitivity was going down.
p273
aVAnd in Chile, you still had antibiotic sensitivity.
p274
aa(lp275
VSo, it looks like Chile dodged two bullets.
p276
aVThey got the organism to evolve to mildness,
p277
aVand they got no development of antibiotic resistance.
p278
aVNow, these ideas should apply across the board,
p279
aVas long as you can figure out why some organisms evolved to virulence.
p280
aVAnd I want to give you just one more example,
p281
aVbecause we've talked a little bit about malaria.
p282
aVAnd the example I want to deal with is,
p283
aVor the idea I want to deal with, the question is,
p284
aVwhat can we do to try to get the malarial organism to evolve to mildness?
p285
aVNow, malaria's transmitted by a mosquito,
p286
aVand normally if you're infected with malaria, and you're feeling sick,
p287
aVit makes it even easier for the mosquito to bite you.
p288
aa(lp289
VAnd you can show, just by looking at data from literature,
p290
aVthat vector-borne diseases are more harmful
p291
aVthan non-vector-borne diseases.
p292
aVBut I think there's a really fascinating example
p293
aVof what one can do experimentally to try to actually demonstrate this.
p294
aVIn the case of waterborne transmission,
p295
aVwe'd like to clean up the water supplies,
p296
aVsee whether or not we can get those organisms to evolve towards mildness.
p297
aVIn the case of malaria, what we'd like to do is mosquito-proof houses.
p298
aVAnd the logic's a little more subtle here.
p299
aVIf you mosquito-proof houses,
p300
aVwhen people get sick, they're sitting in bed \u2014
p301
aVor in mosquito-proof hospitals, they're sitting in a hospital bed \u2014
p302
aVand the mosquitoes can't get to them.
p303
aa(lp304
VSo, if you're a harmful variant
p305
aVin a place where you've got mosquito-proof housing, then you're a loser.
p306
aVThe only pathogens that get transmitted
p307
aVare the ones that are infecting people that feel healthy enough
p308
aVto walk outside and get mosquito bites.
p309
aVSo, if you were to mosquito proof houses,
p310
aVyou should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness.
p311
aVAnd there's a really wonderful experiment that was done
p312
aVthat suggests that we really should go ahead and do this.
p313
aVAnd that experiment was done in Northern Alabama.
p314
aVJust to give you a little perspective on this,
p315
aVI've given you a star at the intellectual center of the United States,
p316
aVwhich is right there in Louisville, Kentucky.
p317
aVAnd this really cool experiment was done
p318
aVabout 200 miles south of there, in Northern Alabama,
p319
aVby the Tennessee Valley Authority.
p320
aVThey had dammed up the Tennessee River.
p321
aVThey'd caused the water to back up,
p322
aVthey needed electric, hydroelectric power.
p323
aVAnd when you get stagnant water, you get mosquitoes.
p324
aVThey found in the late '30s \u2014 10 years after they'd made these dams \u2014
p325
aVthat the people in Northern Alabama were infected with malaria,
p326
aVabout a third to half of them were infected with malaria.
p327
aa(lp328
VThis shows you the positions of some of these dams.
p329
aVOK, so the Tennessee Valley Authority was in a little bit of a bind.
p330
aVThere wasn't DDT, there wasn't chloroquines: what do they do?
p331
aVWell, they decided to mosquito proof every house in Northern Alabama.
p332
aVSo they did. They divided Northern Alabama into 11 zones,
p333
aVand within three years, about 100 dollars per house,
p334
aVthey mosquito proofed every house.
p335
aVAnd these are the data.
p336
aVEvery row across here represents one of those 11 zones.
p337
aVAnd the asterisks represent the time at which
p338
aVthe mosquito proofing was complete.
p339
aVAnd so what you can see is that
p340
aVjust the mosquito-proofed housing, and nothing else,
p341
aVcaused the eradication of malaria.
p342
aVAnd this was, incidentally, published in 1949,
p343
aVin the leading textbook of malaria, called "Boyd's Malariology."
p344
aVBut almost no malaria experts even know it exists.
p345
aVThis is important,
p346
aVbecause it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities,
p347
aVyou can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing houses.
p348
aa(lp349
VNow, I would suggest that you could do this in a lot of places.
p350
aVLike, you know, just as you get into the malaria zone,
p351
aVsub-Saharan Africa.
p352
aVBut as you move to really intense biting rate areas, like Nigeria,
p353
aVyou're certainly not going to eradicate.
p354
aVBut that's when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness.
p355
aVSo to me, it's an experiment that's waiting to happen,
p356
aVand if it confirms the prediction, then
p357
aVwe should have a very powerful tool.
p358
aVIn a way, much more powerful than the kind of tools we're looking at,
p359
aVbecause most of what's being done today is
p360
aVto rely on things like anti-malarial drugs.
p361
aVAnd we know that, although it's great to make those
p362
aVanti-malarial drugs available at really low cost and high frequency,
p363
aVwe know that when you make them highly available
p364
aVyou're going to get resistance to those drugs.
p365
aVAnd so it's a short-term solution.
p366
aVThis is a long-term solution.
p367
aa(lp368
VWhat I'm suggesting here is that we could get evolution
p369
aVworking in the direction we want it to go,
p370
aVrather than always having to battle evolution as a problem
p371
aVthat stymies our efforts to control the pathogen,
p372
aVfor example with anti-malarial drugs.
p373
aVSo, this table I've given just to emphasize
p374
aVthat I've only talked about two examples.
p375
aVBut as I said earlier, this kind of logic applies across the board
p376
aVfor infectious diseases, and it ought to.
p377
aVBecause when we're dealing with infectious diseases, we're dealing with living systems.
p378
aVWe're dealing with living systems;
p379
aVwe're dealing with systems that evolve.
p380
aVAnd so if you do something with those systems,
p381
aVthey're going to evolve one way or another.
p382
aVAnd all I'm saying is that we need to figure out how they'll evolve,
p383
aVso that \u2014 we need to adjust our interventions
p384
aVto get the most bang for the intervention buck,
p385
aVso that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go.
p386
aa(lp387
VSo, I don't really have time to talk about those things,
p388
aVbut I did want to put them up there,
p389
aVjust to give you a sense that there really are solutions
p390
aVto controlling the evolution of harmfulness
p391
aVof some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with.
p392
aVAnd this links up with a lot of the other ideas that have been talked about.
p393
aVSo, for example, earlier today there was discussion of,
p394
aVhow do you really lower sexual transmission of HIV?
p395
aVWhat this emphasizes is that we need to figure out how it will work.
p396
aVWill it maybe get lowered if we alter the economy of the area?
p397
aVIt may get lowered if we intervene in ways that
p398
aVencourage people to stay more faithful to partners, and so on.
p399
aa(lp400
VBut the key thing is to figure out how to lower it,
p401
aVbecause if we lower it, we'll get an evolutionary change in the virus.
p402
aVAnd the data really do support this:
p403
aVthat you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness.
p404
aVAnd that will just add to the effectiveness of our control efforts.
p405
aVSo the other thing I really like about this,
p406
aVbesides the fact that it brings a whole new dimension
p407
aVinto the study of control of disease,
p408
aVis that often the kinds of interventions that you want,
p409
aVthat it indicates should be done,
p410
aVare the kinds of interventions that people want anyhow.

aVBut people just haven't been able to justify the cost.
p412
aa(lp413
VSo, this is the kind of thing I'm talking about.
p414
aVIf we know that we're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water,
p415
aVthen I think that we can say,
p416
aVlet's push the effort into that aspect of the control,
p417
aVso that we can actually solve the problem,
p418
aVeven though, if you just look at the frequency of infection,
p419
aVyou would suggest that you can't solve the problem well enough
p420
aVjust by cleaning up water supply.
p421
aVAnyhow, I'll end that there, and thank you very much.

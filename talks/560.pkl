VInformation technology grows in an exponential manner.
p5
aVIt's not linear. And our intuition is linear.
p6
aVWhen we walked through the savanna a thousand years ago
p7
aVwe made linear predictions where that animal would be,
p8
aVand that worked fine. It's hardwired in our brains.
p9
aVBut the pace of exponential growth
p10
aVis really what describes information technologies.
p11
aVAnd it's not just computation.
p12
aVThere is a big difference between linear and exponential growth.
p13
aVIf I take 30 steps linearly \u2014 one, two, three, four, five \u2014
p14
aVI get to 30.
p15
aVIf I take 30 steps exponentially \u2014 two, four, eight, 16 \u2014
p16
aVI get to a billion.
p17
aVIt makes a huge difference.
p18
aVAnd that really describes information technology.
p19
aa(lp20
VWhen I was a student at MIT,
p21
aVwe all shared one computer that took up a whole building.
p22
aVThe computer in your cellphone today is a million times cheaper,
p23
aVa million times smaller,
p24
aVa thousand times more powerful.
p25
aVThat's a billion-fold increase in capability per dollar
p26
aVthat we've actually experienced since I was a student.
p27
aVAnd we're going to do it again in the next 25 years.
p28
aVInformation technology progresses
p29
aVthrough a series of S-curves
p30
aVwhere each one is a different paradigm.
p31
aVSo people say, "What's going to happen when Moore's Law comes to an end?"
p32
aVWhich will happen around 2020.
p33
aVWe'll then go to the next paradigm.
p34
aVAnd Moore's Law was not the first paradigm
p35
aVto bring exponential growth to computing.
p36
aVThe exponential growth of computing started
p37
aVdecades before Gordon Moore was even born.
p38
aVAnd it doesn't just apply to computation.
p39
aVIt's really any technology where we can measure
p40
aVthe underlying information properties.
p41
aa(lp42
VHere we have 49 famous computers. I put them in a logarithmic graph.
p43
aVThe logarithmic scale hides the scale of the increase,
p44
aVbecause this represents trillions-fold increase
p45
aVsince the 1890 census.
p46
aVIn 1950s they were shrinking vacuum tubes,
p47
aVmaking them smaller and smaller. They finally hit a wall;
p48
aVthey couldn't shrink the vacuum tube any more and keep the vacuum.
p49
aVAnd that was the end of the shrinking of vacuum tubes,
p50
aVbut it was not the end of the exponential growth of computing.
p51
aVWe went to the fourth paradigm, transistors,
p52
aVand finally integrated circuits.
p53
aVWhen that comes to an end we'll go to the sixth paradigm;
p54
aVthree-dimensional self-organizing molecular circuits.
p55
aa(lp56
VBut what's even more amazing, really, than this
p57
aVfantastic scale of progress,
p58
aVis that \u2014 look at how predictable this is.
p59
aVI mean this went through thick and thin,
p60
aVthrough war and peace, through boom times and recessions.
p61
aVThe Great Depression made not a dent in this exponential progression.
p62
aVWe'll see the same thing in the economic recession we're having now.
p63
aVAt least the exponential growth of information technology capability
p64
aVwill continue unabated.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd I just updated these graphs.
p67
aVBecause I had them through 2002 in my book, "The Singularity is Near."
p68
aVSo we updated them,
p69
aVso I could present it here, to 2007.
p70
aVAnd I was asked, "Well aren't you nervous?
p71
aVMaybe it kind of didn't stay on this exponential progression."
p72
aVI was a little nervous
p73
aVbecause maybe the data wouldn't be right,
p74
aVbut I've done this now for 30 years,
p75
aVand it has stayed on this exponential progression.
p76
aa(lp77
VLook at this graph here.You could buy one transistor for a dollar in 1968.
p78
aVYou can buy half a billion today,
p79
aVand they are actually better, because they are faster.
p80
aVBut look at how predictable this is.
p81
aVAnd I'd say this knowledge is over-fitting to past data.
p82
aVI've been making these forward-looking predictions for about 30 years.
p83
aVAnd the cost of a transistor cycle,
p84
aVwhich is a measure of the price performance of electronics,
p85
aVcomes down about every year.
p86
aVThat's a 50 percent deflation rate.
p87
aVAnd it's also true of other examples,
p88
aVlike DNA data or brain data.
p89
aVBut we more than make up for that.
p90
aVWe actually ship more than twice as much
p91
aVof every form of information technology.
p92
aVWe've had 18 percent growth in constant dollars
p93
aVin every form of information technology for the last half-century,
p94
aVdespite the fact that you can get twice as much of it each year.
p95
aa(lp96
VThis is a completely different example.
p97
aVThis is not Moore's Law.
p98
aVThe amount of DNA data
p99
aVwe've sequenced has doubled every year.
p100
aVThe cost has come down by half every year.
p101
aVAnd this has been a smooth progression
p102
aVsince the beginning of the genome project.
p103
aVAnd halfway through the project, skeptics said,
p104
aV"Well, this is not working out. You're halfway through the genome project
p105
aVand you've finished one percent of the project."
p106
aVBut that was really right on schedule.
p107
aVBecause if you double one percent seven more times,
p108
aVwhich is exactly what happened,
p109
aVyou get 100 percent. And the project was finished on time.
p110
aa(lp111
VCommunication technologies:
p112
aV50 different ways to measure this,
p113
aVthe number of bits being moved around, the size of the Internet.
p114
aVBut this has progressed at an exponential pace.
p115
aVThis is deeply democratizing.
p116
aVI wrote, over 20 years ago in "The Age of Intelligent Machines,"
p117
aVwhen the Soviet Union was going strong, that it would be swept away
p118
aVby this growth of decentralized communication.
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd we will have plenty of computation as we go through the 21st century
p121
aVto do things like simulate regions of the human brain.
p122
aVBut where will we get the software?
p123
aVSome critics say, "Oh, well software is stuck in the mud."
p124
aVBut we are learning more and more about the human brain.
p125
aVSpatial resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year.
p126
aVThe amount of data we're getting about the brain is doubling every year.
p127
aVAnd we're showing that we can actually turn this data
p128
aVinto working models and simulations of brain regions.
p129
aa(lp130
VThere is about 20 regions of the brain that have been modeled,
p131
aVsimulated and tested:
p132
aVthe auditory cortex, regions of the visual cortex;
p133
aVcerebellum, where we do our skill formation;
p134
aVslices of the cerebral cortex, where we do our rational thinking.
p135
aVAnd all of this has fueled
p136
aVan increase, very smooth and predictable, of productivity.
p137
aVWe've gone from 30 dollars to 130 dollars
p138
aVin constant dollars in the value of an average hour of human labor,
p139
aVfueled by this information technology.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd we're all concerned about energy and the environment.
p142
aVWell this is a logarithmic graph.
p143
aVThis represents a smooth doubling,
p144
aVevery two years, of the amount of solar energy we're creating,
p145
aVparticularly as we're now applying nanotechnology,
p146
aVa form of information technology, to solar panels.
p147
aVAnd we're only eight doublings away
p148
aVfrom it meeting 100 percent of our energy needs.
p149
aVAnd there is 10 thousand times more sunlight than we need.
p150
aa(lp151
VWe ultimately will merge with this technology. It's already very close to us.
p152
aVWhen I was a student it was across campus, now it's in our pockets.
p153
aVWhat used to take up a building now fits in our pockets.
p154
aVWhat now fits in our pockets would fit in a blood cell in 25 years.
p155
aVAnd we will begin to actually deeply influence
p156
aVour health and our intelligence,
p157
aVas we get closer and closer to this technology.
p158
aa(lp159
VBased on that we are announcing, here at TED,
p160
aVin true TED tradition, Singularity University.
p161
aVIt's a new university
p162
aVthat's founded by Peter Diamandis, who is here in the audience,
p163
aVand myself.
p164
aVIt's backed by NASA and Google,
p165
aVand other leaders in the high-tech and science community.
p166
aVAnd our goal was to assemble the leaders,
p167
aVboth teachers and students,
p168
aVin these exponentially growing information technologies,
p169
aVand their application.
p170
aVBut Larry Page made an impassioned speech
p171
aVat our organizing meeting,
p172
aVsaying we should devote this study
p173
aVto actually addressing some of the major challenges facing humanity.
p174
aVAnd if we did that, then Google would back this.
p175
aVAnd so that's what we've done.
p176
aa(lp177
VThe last third of the nine-week intensive summer session
p178
aVwill be devoted to a group project to address
p179
aVsome major challenge of humanity.
p180
aVLike for example, applying the Internet,
p181
aVwhich is now ubiquitous, in the rural areas of China or in Africa,
p182
aVto bringing health information
p183
aVto developing areas of the world.
p184
aVAnd these projects will continue past these sessions,
p185
aVusing collaborative interactive communication.
p186
aVAll the intellectual property that is created and taught
p187
aVwill be online and available,
p188
aVand developed online in a collaborative fashion.
p189
aa(lp190
VHere is our founding meeting.
p191
aVBut this is being announced today.
p192
aVIt will be permanently headquartered in Silicon Valley,
p193
aVat the NASA Ames research center.
p194
aVThere are different programs for graduate students,
p195
aVfor executives at different companies.
p196
aVThe first six tracks here \u2014 artificial intelligence,
p197
aVadvanced computing technologies, biotechnology, nanotechnology \u2014
p198
aVare the different core areas of information technology.
p199
aVThen we are going to apply them to the other areas,
p200
aVlike energy, ecology,
p201
aVpolicy law and ethics, entrepreneurship,
p202
aVso that people can bring these new technologies to the world.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo we're very appreciative of the support we've gotten
p205
aVfrom both the intellectual leaders, the high-tech leaders,
p206
aVparticularly Google and NASA.
p207
aVThis is an exciting new venture.
p208
aVAnd we invite you to participate. Thank you very much.

VI'm here today
p5
aVto start a revolution.
p6
aVNow before you get up in arms,
p7
aVor you break into song,
p8
aVor you pick a favorite color,
p9
aVI want to define what I mean by revolution.
p10
aVBy revolution,
p11
aVI mean a drastic and far-reaching change
p12
aVin the way we think and behave \u2014
p13
aVthe way we think and the way we behave.
p14
aVNow why, Steve, why do we need a revolution?
p15
aVWe need a revolution
p16
aVbecause things aren't working; they're just not working.
p17
aVAnd that makes me really sad
p18
aVbecause I'm sick and tired of things not working.
p19
aVYou know, I'm sick and tired of us not living up to our potential.
p20
aVI'm sick and tired of us being last.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd we are last place in so many things \u2014
p23
aVfor example, social factors.
p24
aVWe're last place in Europe in innovation.
p25
aVThere we are right at the end, right at the bottom,
p26
aVlast place as a culture that doesn't value innovation.
p27
aVWe're last place in health care,
p28
aVand that's important for a sense of well-being.
p29
aVAnd there we are, not just last in the E.U.,
p30
aVwe're last in Europe, at the very bottom.
p31
aVAnd worst of all,
p32
aVit just came out three weeks ago, many of you have seen it, The Economist.
p33
aVWe're the saddest place on Earth,
p34
aVrelative to GDP per capita \u2014
p35
aVthe saddest place on Earth.
p36
aVThat's social. Let's look at education.
p37
aVWhere do we rank three weeks ago
p38
aVin another report by the OECD?
p39
aVLast in reading, math and science. Last.
p40
aVBusiness:
p41
aVThe lowest perception in the E.U.
p42
aVthat entrepreneurs provide benefits to society.
p43
aVWhy as a result, what happens?
p44
aVThe lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses.
p45
aVAnd this is despite the fact
p46
aVthat everybody knows that small business
p47
aVis the engine of economies.
p48
aVWe hire the most people; we create the most taxes.
p49
aVSo if our engine's broken, guess what?
p50
aVLast in Europe GDP per capita.
p51
aVLast.
p52
aVSo it's no surprise, guys, that 62 percent of Bulgarians
p53
aVare not optimistic about the future.
p54
aVWe're unhappy, we have bad education,
p55
aVand we have the worst businesses.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd these are facts, guys.
p58
aVThis isn't story tale; it's not make-believe.
p59
aVIt's not.
p60
aVIt's not a conspiracy I have got against Bulgaria. These are facts.
p61
aVSo I think it should be really, really clear
p62
aVthat our system is broken.
p63
aVThe way we think, the way we behave,
p64
aVour operating system of behaving is broken.
p65
aVWe need a drastic change in the way we think and behave
p66
aVto transform Bulgaria for the better,
p67
aVfor ourselves, for our friends,
p68
aVfor our family and for our future.
p69
aVHow did this happen?
p70
aVLet's be positive now. We're going to get positive. How did this happen?
p71
aVI think we're last because \u2014
p72
aVand this is going to be drastic to some of you \u2014
p73
aVbecause we are handicapping ourselves.
p74
aVWe're holding ourselves back
p75
aVbecause we don't value play.
p76
aVI said "play," all right.
p77
aa(lp78
VIn case some of you forgot what play is, this is what play looks like.
p79
aVBabies play, kids play,
p80
aVadults play.
p81
aVWe don't value play.
p82
aVIn fact, we devalue play.
p83
aVAnd we devalue it in three areas.
p84
aVLet's go back to the same three areas.
p85
aVSocial: 45 years of what?
p86
aVOf communism \u2014
p87
aVof valuing the society and the state over the individual
p88
aVand squashing, inadvertently,
p89
aVcreativity, individual self-expression and innovation.
p90
aVAnd instead, what do we value?
p91
aVBecause it's shown
p92
aVthe way we apply, generate and use knowledge
p93
aVis affected by our social and institutional context,
p94
aVwhich told us what in communism?
p95
aVTo be serious.
p96
aVTo be really, really serious.
p97
aVIt did.
p98
aV(Applause)
p99
aVBe serious.
p100
aVI can't tell you how many times I've been scolded in the park
p101
aVfor letting my kids play on the ground.
p102
aVHeaven forbid they play in the dirt, the kal,
p103
aVor even worse, lokvi, water \u2014 that will kill them.
p104
aVI have been told by babas and dyados
p105
aVthat we shouldn't let our kids play so much
p106
aVbecause life is serious
p107
aVand we need to train them for the seriousness of life.
p108
aa(lp109
VWe have a serious meme running through.
p110
aVIt's a social gene running through us.
p111
aVIt's a serious gene.
p112
aVIt's 45 years of it
p113
aVthat's created what I call the "baba factor."
p114
aV(Laughter)
p115
aV(Applause)
p116
aVAnd here's how it works.
p117
aVStep one: woman says, "I want to have a baby. Iskam baby."
p118
aVStep two: we get the baby. Woohoo!
p119
aVBut then what happens in step three?
p120
aVI want to go back to work
p121
aVbecause I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees.
p122
aVI'm going to give bebko to baba.
p123
aVBut we need to remember
p124
aVthat baba's been infected by the serious meme for 45 years.
p125
aVSo what happens?
p126
aVShe passes that virus on to baby,
p127
aVand it takes a really, really, really long time \u2014 as the redwood trees \u2014
p128
aVfor that serious meme
p129
aVto get out of our operating system.
p130
aa(lp131
VWhat happens then?
p132
aVIt goes into education where we have an antiquated education system
p133
aVthat has little changed for 100 years,
p134
aVthat values rote learning,
p135
aVmemorization and standardization,
p136
aVand devalues self-expression, self-exploration,
p137
aVquestioning, creativity and play.
p138
aVIt's a crap system.
p139
aVTrue story: I went looking for a school for my kid.
p140
aVWe went to this prestigious little school
p141
aVand they say they're going to study math 10 times a week
p142
aVand science eight times a week
p143
aVand reading five times a day and all this stuff.
p144
aVAnd we said, "Well what about play and recess?"
p145
aVAnd they said, "Ha. There won't be a single moment in the schedule."
p146
aV(Laughter)
p147
aVAnd we said, "He's five."
p148
aVWhat a crime. What a crime.
p149
aVAnd it's a crime
p150
aVthat our education system is so serious because education is serious
p151
aVthat we're creating mindless, robotic workers
p152
aVto put bolts in pre-drilled holes.
p153
aVBut I'm sorry, the problems of today
p154
aVare not the problems of the Industrial Revolution.
p155
aVWe need adaptability,
p156
aVthe ability to learn how to be creative and innovative.
p157
aVWe don't need mechanized workers.
p158
aVBut no, now our meme goes into work where we don't value play.
p159
aVWe create robotic workers that we treat like assets,
p160
aVto lever and just throw away.
p161
aa(lp162
VWhat are qualities of a Bulgarian work?
p163
aVAutocratic \u2014
p164
aVdo what I say because I'm the chef.
p165
aVI'm the boss and I know better than you.
p166
aVUntrusting \u2014 you're obviously a criminal, so I'm going to install cameras.
p167
aV(Laughter)
p168
aVControlling \u2014
p169
aVyou're obviously an idiot, so I'm going to make
p170
aVa zillion little processes for you to follow so you don't step out of the box.
p171
aVSo they're restrictive \u2014 don't use your mobile phone,
p172
aVdon't use your laptop, don't search the Internet,
p173
aVdon't be on I.M.
p174
aVThat's somehow unprofessional and bad.
p175
aVAnd at the end of the day, it's unfulfilling
p176
aVbecause you're controlled, you're restricted, you're not valued
p177
aVand you're not having any fun.
p178
aVIn social, in education and in our business,
p179
aVdon't value play.
p180
aVAnd that's why we're last,
p181
aVbecause we don't value play.
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd you can say, "That's ridiculous, Steve. What a dumb idea.
p184
aVIt can't be because of play.
p185
aVJust play, that's a stupid thing."
p186
aVWe have the serious meme in us.
p187
aVWell I'm going to say no.
p188
aVAnd I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech \u2014
p189
aVthat play is the catalyst, it is the revolution,
p190
aVthat we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better.
p191
aVPlay:
p192
aVour brains
p193
aVare hardwired for play.
p194
aVEvolution has selected,
p195
aVover millions and billions of years,
p196
aVfor play in animals and in humans.
p197
aVAnd you know what?
p198
aVEvolution does a really, really good job
p199
aVof deselecting traits that aren't advantageous to us
p200
aVand selecting traits for competitive advantage.
p201
aVNature isn't stupid, and it selected for play.
p202
aVThroughout the animal kingdom, for example:
p203
aVants. Ants play.
p204
aVMaybe you didn't know that.
p205
aVBut when they're playing,
p206
aVthey're learning the social order and dynamics of things.
p207
aVRats play, but what you might not have known
p208
aVis that rats that play more
p209
aVhave bigger brains
p210
aVand they learn tasks better,
p211
aVskills.
p212
aVKittens play. We all know kittens play.
p213
aVBut what you may not know
p214
aVis that kittens deprived of play
p215
aVare unable to interact socially.
p216
aVThey can still hunt, but they can't be social.
p217
aVBears play.
p218
aVBut what you may not know
p219
aVis that bears that play more survive longer.
p220
aVIt's not the bears that learn how to fish better.
p221
aVIt's the ones that play more.
p222
aa(lp223
VAnd a final really interesting study \u2014
p224
aVit's been shown, a correlation
p225
aVbetween play and brain size.
p226
aVThe more you play, the bigger the brains there are.
p227
aVDolphins, pretty big brains, play a lot.
p228
aVBut who do you think
p229
aVwith the biggest brains are the biggest players?
p230
aVYours truly: humans.
p231
aVKids play, we play \u2014
p232
aVof every nationality, of every race,
p233
aVof every color, of every religion.
p234
aVIt's a universal thing \u2014 we play.
p235
aVAnd it's not just kids, it's adults too.
p236
aa(lp237
VReally cool term: neoteny \u2014
p238
aVthe retention of play and juvenile traits in adults.
p239
aVAnd who are the biggest neotenists?
p240
aVHumans. We play sports.
p241
aVWe do it for fun, or as Olympians, or as professionals.
p242
aVWe play musical instruments.
p243
aVWe dance, we kiss, we sing,
p244
aVwe just goof around.
p245
aVWe're designed by nature to play
p246
aVfrom birth to old age.
p247
aVWe're designed to do that continuously \u2014
p248
aVto play and play a lot
p249
aVand not stop playing.
p250
aVIt is a huge benefit.
p251
aVJust like there's benefits to animals,
p252
aVthere's benefits to humans.
p253
aVFor example, it's been shown
p254
aVto stimulate neural growth in the amygdala,
p255
aVin the area where it controls emotions.
p256
aVIt's been shown to promote pre-frontal cortex development
p257
aVwhere a lot of cognition is happening.
p258
aVAs a result, what happens?
p259
aVWe develop more emotional maturity if we play more.
p260
aVWe develop better decision-making ability
p261
aVif we play more.
p262
aa(lp263
VThese guys are facts.
p264
aVIt's not fiction, it's not story tales, it's not make-believe;
p265
aVit's cold, hard science.
p266
aVThese are the benefits to play.
p267
aVIt is a genetic birthright that we have,
p268
aVlike walking or speaking or seeing.
p269
aVAnd if we handicap ourselves with play,
p270
aVwe handicap ourselves
p271
aVas if we would with any other birthright that we have.
p272
aVWe hold ourselves back.
p273
aVLittle exercise just for a second:
p274
aVclose your eyes
p275
aVand try to imagine a world without play.
p276
aVImagine a world without theater, without the arts,
p277
aVwithout song, without dancing,
p278
aVwithout soccer, without football,
p279
aVwithout laughter.
p280
aVWhat does this world look like?
p281
aVIt's pretty bleak.
p282
aVIt's pretty glum.
p283
aa(lp284
VNow imagine your workplace.
p285
aVIs it fun? Is it playful?
p286
aVOr maybe the workplace of your friends \u2014 here we're forward thinking.
p287
aVIs it fun? Is it playful?
p288
aVOr is it crap? Is it autocratic, controlling,
p289
aVrestrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling?
p290
aVWe have this concept
p291
aVthat the opposite of play is work.
p292
aVWe even feel guilty if we're seen playing at work.
p293
aV"Oh, my colleagues see me laughing. I must not have enough work,"
p294
aVor, "Oh, I've got to hide because my boss might see me.
p295
aVHe's going to think I'm not working hard."
p296
aVBut I have news for you: our thinking is backwards.
p297
aa(lp298
VThe opposite of play
p299
aVis not work.
p300
aVThe opposite of play
p301
aVis depression. It's depression.
p302
aVIn fact,
p303
aVplay improves our work.
p304
aVJust like there's benefits for humans and animals,
p305
aVthere's benefits for play at work.
p306
aVFor example, it stimulates creativity.
p307
aVIt increases our openness to change.
p308
aVIt improves our ability to learn.
p309
aVIt provides a sense of purpose and mastery \u2014
p310
aVtwo key motivational things
p311
aVthat increase productivity,
p312
aVthrough play.
p313
aVSo before you start thinking of play as just not serious,
p314
aVplay doesn't mean frivolous.
p315
aVYou know, the professional athlete that loves skiing,
p316
aVhe's serious about it, but he loves it.
p317
aVHe's having fun, he's in the groove, he's in the flow.
p318
aVA doctor might be serious,
p319
aVbut laughter's still a great medicine.
p320
aVOur thinking is backwards.
p321
aVWe shouldn't be feeling guilty.
p322
aVWe should be celebrating play.
p323
aa(lp324
VQuick example from the corporate world.
p325
aVFedEx, easy motto: people, service, profit.
p326
aVIf you treat your people like people, if you treat them great,
p327
aVthey're happier, they're fulfilled, they have a sense of mastery and purpose.
p328
aVWhat happens? They give better service \u2014
p329
aVnot worse, but better.
p330
aVAnd when customers call for service
p331
aVand they're dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled,
p332
aVhow do the customers feel? They feel great.
p333
aVAnd what do great customers do, great-feeling customers?
p334
aVThey buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends,
p335
aVwhich leads to more profit.
p336
aVPeople, service, profit.
p337
aVPlay increases productivity, not decreases.
p338
aa(lp339
VAnd you're going to say,
p340
aV"Gee, that can work for FedEx out there in the United States,
p341
aVbut it can't work in Bulgaria.
p342
aVNo way. We're different."
p343
aVIt does work in Bulgaria, you guys. Two reasons.
p344
aVOne, play is universal.
p345
aVThere's nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can't play,
p346
aVbesides the serious meme that we have to kick out.
p347
aVTwo, I've tried it. I've tried at Sciant.
p348
aVWhen I got there, we had zero happy customers.
p349
aVNot one customer would refer us.
p350
aVI asked them all.
p351
aVWe had marginal profit \u2014 I did.
p352
aVWe had marginal profits,
p353
aVand we had unhappy stakeholders.
p354
aVThrough some basic change,
p355
aVchange like improving transparency,
p356
aVchange like promoting self-direction
p357
aVand collaboration, encouraging collaboration,
p358
aVnot autocracy,
p359
aVthe things like having a results-focus.
p360
aVI don't care when you get in in the morning. I don't care when you leave.
p361
aVI care that your customer and your team is happy
p362
aVand you're organized with that.
p363
aVWhy do I care if you get in at nine o'clock?
p364
aVBasically promoting fun.
p365
aVThrough promoting fun and a great environment,
p366
aVwe were able to transform Sciant
p367
aVand, in just three short years \u2014
p368
aVsounds like a long time, but change is slow \u2014
p369
aVevery customer, from zero to every customer referring us,
p370
aVabove average profits for the industry
p371
aVand happy stakeholders.
p372
aVAnd you can say, "Well how do you know they're happy?"
p373
aVWell we did win, every year that we entered,
p374
aVone of the rankings for best employer for small business.
p375
aVIndependent analysis from anonymous employees
p376
aVon their surveys.
p377
aVIt does, and it can, work in Bulgaria.
p378
aVThere's nothing holding us back,
p379
aVexcept our own mentality about play.
p380
aa(lp381
VSo some steps that we can take \u2014 to finish up \u2014
p382
aVhow to make this revolution through play.
p383
aVFirst of all, you have to believe me.
p384
aVIf you don't believe me,
p385
aVwell just go home and think about it some more or something.
p386
aVSecond of all, if you don't have the feeling of play in you,
p387
aVyou need to rediscover play.
p388
aVWhatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy,
p389
aVthat you enjoyed only six months ago,
p390
aVbut now that you've got that promotion you can't enjoy,
p391
aVbecause you feel like you have to be serious,
p392
aVrediscover it.
p393
aVI don't care if it's mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game.
p394
aVRediscover that
p395
aVbecause you're the leaders,
p396
aVthe innovation leaders, the thought leaders.
p397
aVYou're the ones that have to go back to the office
p398
aVor talk to your friends
p399
aVand ignite the fire of change in the play revolution.
p400
aVYou guys have to, and if you're not feeling it,
p401
aVyour colleagues, your employees, aren't going to feel it.
p402
aVYou've got to go back and say, "Hey, I'm going to trust you."
p403
aVWeird concept: I hired you; I should trust you.
p404
aVI'm going to let you make decisions. I'm going to empower you,
p405
aVand I'm going to delegate to the lowest level, rather than the top.
p406
aVI'm going to encourage constructive criticism.
p407
aVI'm going to let you challenge authority.
p408
aVBecause it's by challenging the way things are always done
p409
aVis that we are able to break out of the rut that we're in
p410
aVand create innovative solutions
p411
aVto problems of today.
p412
aa(lp413
VWe're not always right as leaders.
p414
aVWe're going to eradicate fear.
p415
aVFear is the enemy of play.
p416
aVAnd we're going to do things
p417
aVlike eliminate restrictions.
p418
aVYou know what, let them use their mobile phone
p419
aVfor personal calls \u2014 heaven forbid.
p420
aVLet them be on the Internet.
p421
aVLet them be on instant messengers.
p422
aVLet them take long lunches.
p423
aVLunch is like the recess for work.
p424
aVIt's when you go out in the world
p425
aVand you recharge your brain, you meet your friends,
p426
aVyou have a beer, you have some food, you talk,
p427
aVyou get some synergy of ideas
p428
aVthat maybe you wouldn't have had before.
p429
aVLet them do it. Give them some freedom,
p430
aVand in general, let them play. Let them have fun at the workplace.
p431
aVWe spend so much of our lives at the workplace,
p432
aVand it's supposed to be, what, a miserable grind,
p433
aVso that 20 years from now, we wake up and say, "Is this it?
p434
aVIs that all there was?"
p435
aVUnacceptable. Nepriemliv.
p436
aV(Laughter)
p437
aa(lp438
VSo in summary,
p439
aVwe need a drastic change
p440
aVin the way we think and behave,
p441
aVbut we don't need
p442
aVa workers' revolution.
p443
aVWe don't need a workers' revolution.
p444
aVWhat we need
p445
aVis a players' uprising.
p446
aVWhat we need is a players' uprising.
p447
aVWhat we need is a players' uprising.

VWhat I'm going to do is, I'm going to explain to you
p5
aVan extreme green concept
p6
aVthat was developed at NASA's Glenn Research Center
p7
aVin Cleveland, Ohio.
p8
aVBut before I do that, we have to go over
p9
aVthe definition of what green is,
p10
aV'cause a lot of us have a different definition of it.
p11
aVGreen. The product is created through
p12
aVenvironmentally and socially conscious means.
p13
aVThere's plenty of things that are being called green now.
p14
aVWhat does it actually mean?
p15
aVWe use three metrics to determine green.
p16
aVThe first metric is: Is it sustainable?
p17
aVWhich means, are you preserving what you are doing for future use
p18
aVor for future generations?
p19
aVIs it alternative? Is it different than what is being used today,
p20
aVor does it have a lower carbon footprint
p21
aVthan what's used conventionally?
p22
aVAnd three: Is it renewable?
p23
aVDoes it come from Earth's natural replenishing resources,
p24
aVsuch as sun, wind and water?
p25
aa(lp26
VNow, my task at NASA is to develop
p27
aVthe next generation of aviation fuels.
p28
aVExtreme green. Why aviation?
p29
aVThe field of aviation uses more fuel than just about
p30
aVevery other combined. We need to find an alternative.
p31
aVAlso it's a national aeronautics directive.
p32
aVOne of the national aeronautics goals is to develop
p33
aVthe next generation of fuels, biofuels,
p34
aVusing domestic and safe, friendly resources.
p35
aVNow, combating that challenge
p36
aVwe have to also meet the big three metric \u2014
p37
aVActually, extreme green for us is all three together;
p38
aVthat's why you see the plus there. I was told to say that.
p39
aVSo it has to be the big three at GRC. That's another metric.
p40
aVNinety-seven percent of the world's water is saltwater.
p41
aVHow about we use that? Combine that with number three.
p42
aVDo not use arable land.
p43
aVBecause crops are already growing on that land
p44
aVthat's very scarce around the world.
p45
aVNumber two: Don't compete with food crops.
p46
aVThat's already a well established entity, they don't need another entry.
p47
aVAnd lastly the most precious resource we have on this Earth
p48
aVis fresh water. Don't use fresh water.
p49
aVIf 97.5 percent of the world's water is saltwater,
p50
aV2.5 percent is fresh water. Less than a half percent
p51
aVof that is accessible for human use.
p52
aVBut 60 percent of the population lives within that one percent.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo, combating my problem was, now I have to be extreme green
p55
aVand meet the big three. Ladies and gentlemen,
p56
aVwelcome to the GreenLab Research Facility.
p57
aVThis is a facility dedicated to the next generation
p58
aVof aviation fuels using halophytes.
p59
aVA halophyte is a salt-tolerating plant.
p60
aVMost plants don't like salt, but halophytes tolerate salt.
p61
aVWe also are using weeds
p62
aVand we are also using algae.
p63
aVThe good thing about our lab is, we've had
p64
aV3,600 visitors in the last two years.
p65
aVWhy do you think that's so?
p66
aVBecause we are on to something special.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo, in the lower you see the GreenLab obviously,
p69
aVand on the right hand side you'll see algae.
p70
aVIf you are into the business of the next generation
p71
aVof aviation fuels, algae is a viable option,
p72
aVthere's a lot of funding right now,
p73
aVand we have an algae to fuels program.
p74
aVThere's two types of algae growing.
p75
aVOne is a closed photobioreactor that you see here,
p76
aVand what you see on the other side is our species \u2014
p77
aVwe are currently using a species called Scenedesmus dimorphus.
p78
aVOur job at NASA is to take the experimental and computational
p79
aVand make a better mixing for the closed photobioreactors.
p80
aVNow the problems with closed photobioreactors are:
p81
aVThey are quite expensive, they are automated,
p82
aVand it's very difficult to get them in large scale.
p83
aVSo on large scale what do they use?
p84
aVWe use open pond systems. Now, around the world
p85
aVthey are growing algae, with this racetrack design
p86
aVthat you see here. Looks like an oval with
p87
aVa paddle wheel and mixes really well,
p88
aVbut when it gets around the last turn, which I call turn four \u2014 it's stagnant.
p89
aVWe actually have a solution for that.
p90
aVIn the GreenLab in our open pond system
p91
aVwe use something that happens in nature: waves.
p92
aVWe actually use wave technology on our open pond systems.
p93
aVWe have 95 percent mixing and our lipid content is higher
p94
aVthan a closed photobioreactor system,
p95
aVwhich we think is significant.
p96
aa(lp97
VThere is a drawback to algae, however: It's very expensive.
p98
aVIs there a way to produce algae inexpensively?
p99
aVAnd the answer is: yes.
p100
aVWe do the same thing we do with halophytes,
p101
aVand that is: climatic adaptation.
p102
aVIn our GreenLab we have six primary ecosystems
p103
aVthat range from freshwater all the way to saltwater.
p104
aVWhat we do: We take a potential species, we start at freshwater,
p105
aVwe add a little bit more salt, when the second tank here
p106
aVwill be the same ecosystem as Brazil \u2014
p107
aVright next to the sugar cane fields you can have our plants \u2014
p108
aVthe next tank represents Africa, the next tank represents Arizona,
p109
aVthe next tank represents Florida,
p110
aVand the next tank represents California or the open ocean.
p111
aVWhat we are trying to do is to come up with a single species
p112
aVthat can survive anywhere in the world, where there's barren desert.
p113
aVWe are being very successful so far.
p114
aa(lp115
VNow, here's one of the problems.
p116
aVIf you are a farmer, you need five things to be successful: You need seeds,
p117
aVyou need soil, you need water and you need sun,
p118
aVand the last thing that you need is fertilizer.
p119
aVMost people use chemical fertilizers. But guess what?
p120
aVWe do not use chemical fertilizer.
p121
aVWait a second! I just saw lots of greenery in your GreenLab. You have to use fertilizer.
p122
aVBelieve it or not, in our analysis of our saltwater ecosystems
p123
aV80 percent of what we need are in these tanks themselves.
p124
aVThe 20 percent that's missing is nitrogen and phosphorous.
p125
aVWe have a natural solution: fish.
p126
aVNo we don't cut up the fish and put them in there.
p127
aVFish waste is what we use. As a matter of fact
p128
aVwe use freshwater mollies, that we've used our climatic adaptation technique
p129
aVfrom freshwater all the way to seawater.
p130
aVFreshwater mollies: cheap, they love to make babies,
p131
aVand they love to go to the bathroom.
p132
aVAnd the more they go to the bathroom, the more fertilizer we get,
p133
aVthe better off we are, believe it or not.
p134
aVIt should be noted that we use sand as our soil,
p135
aVregular beach sand. Fossilized coral.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo a lot of people ask me, "How did you get started?"
p138
aVWell, we got started in what we call the indoor biofuels lab.
p139
aVIt's a seedling lab. We have 26 different species of halophytes,
p140
aVand five are winners. What we do here is \u2014
p141
aVactually it should be called a death lab, 'cause we try to
p142
aVkill the seedlings, make them rough \u2014
p143
aVand then we come to the GreenLab.
p144
aVWhat you see in the lower corner
p145
aVis a wastewater treatment plant experiment
p146
aVthat we are growing, a macro-algae that I'll talk about in a minute.
p147
aVAnd lastly, it's me actually working in the lab to prove to you I do work,
p148
aVI don't just talk about what I do.
p149
aVHere's the plant species. Salicornia virginica.
p150
aVIt's a wonderful plant. I love that plant.
p151
aVEverywhere we go we see it. It's all over the place, from Maine
p152
aVall the way to California. We love that plant.
p153
aVSecond is Salicornia bigelovii. Very difficult to get around the world.
p154
aVIt is the highest lipid content that we have,
p155
aVbut it has a shortcoming: It's short.
p156
aVNow you take europaea, which is the largest or the tallest plant that we have.
p157
aVAnd what we are trying to do
p158
aVwith natural selection or adaptive biology \u2014 combine all three
p159
aVto make a high-growth, high-lipid plant.
p160
aVNext, when a hurricane decimated the Delaware Bay \u2014 soybean fields gone \u2014
p161
aVwe came up with an idea: Can you have a plant
p162
aVthat has a land reclamation positive in Delaware? And the answer is yes.
p163
aVIt's called seashore mallow. Kosteletzkya virginica \u2014
p164
aVsay that five times fast if you can.
p165
aVThis is a 100 percent usable plant. The seeds: biofuels. The rest: cattle feed.
p166
aVIt's there for 10 years; it's working very well.
p167
aVNow we get to Chaetomorpha.
p168
aVThis is a macro-algae that loves
p169
aVexcess nutrients. If you are in the aquarium industry
p170
aVyou know we use it to clean up dirty tanks.
p171
aVThis species is so significant to us.
p172
aVThe properties are very close to plastic.
p173
aVWe are trying right now to convert this macro-algae into a bioplastic.
p174
aVIf we are successful, we will revolutionize the plastics industry.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo, we have a seed to fuel program.
p177
aVWe have to do something with this biomass that we have.
p178
aVAnd so we do G.C. extraction, lipid optimization, so on and so forth,
p179
aVbecause our goal really is to come up with
p180
aVthe next generation of aviation fuels, aviation specifics, so on and so forth.
p181
aVSo far we talked about water and fuel,
p182
aVbut along the way we found out something interesting about Salicornia:
p183
aVIt's a food product.
p184
aVSo we talk about ideas worth spreading, right?
p185
aVHow about this: In sub-Saharan Africa, next to the sea, saltwater,
p186
aVbarren desert, how about we take that plant,
p187
aVplant it, half use for food, half use for fuel.
p188
aVWe can make that happen, inexpensively.
p189
aVYou can see there's a greenhouse in Germany
p190
aVthat sells it as a health food product.
p191
aVThis is harvested, and in the middle here is a shrimp dish, and it's being pickled.
p192
aVSo I have to tell you a joke. Salicornia is known as sea beans,
p193
aVsaltwater asparagus and pickle weed.
p194
aVSo we are pickling pickle weed in the middle.
p195
aVOh, I thought it was funny. (Laughter)
p196
aVAnd at the bottom is seaman's mustard. It does make sense,
p197
aVthis is a logical snack. You have mustard,
p198
aVyou are a seaman, you see the halophyte, you mix it together,
p199
aVit's a great snack with some crackers.
p200
aVAnd last, garlic with Salicornia, which is what I like.
p201
aVSo, water, fuel and food.
p202
aa(lp203
VNone of this is possible without the GreenLab team.
p204
aVJust like the Miami Heat has the big three, we have the big three at NASA GRC.
p205
aVThat's myself, professor Bob Hendricks, our fearless leader, and Dr. Arnon Chait.
p206
aVThe backbone of the GreenLab is students.
p207
aVOver the last two years we've had 35 different students
p208
aVfrom around the world working at GreenLab.
p209
aVAs a matter fact my division chief says a lot, "You have a green university."
p210
aVI say, "I'm okay with that, 'cause we are nurturing
p211
aVthe next generation of extreme green thinkers, which is significant."
p212
aa(lp213
VSo, in first summary I presented to you what we think
p214
aVis a global solution for food, fuel and water.
p215
aVThere's something missing to be complete.
p216
aVClearly we use electricity. We have a solution for you \u2014
p217
aVWe're using clean energy sources here.
p218
aVSo, we have two wind turbines connected to the GreenLab,
p219
aVwe have four or five more hopefully coming soon.
p220
aVWe are also using something that is quite interesting \u2014
p221
aVthere is a solar array field at NASA's Glenn Research Center,
p222
aVhasn't been used for 15 years.
p223
aVAlong with some of my electrical engineering colleagues,
p224
aVwe realized that they are still viable,
p225
aVso we are refurbishing them right now.
p226
aVIn about 30 days or so they'll be connected to the GreenLab.
p227
aa(lp228
VAnd the reason why you see red, red and yellow, is
p229
aVa lot of people think NASA employees don't work on Saturday \u2014
p230
aVThis is a picture taken on Saturday.
p231
aVThere are no cars around, but you see my truck in yellow. I work on Saturday. (Laughter)
p232
aVThis is a proof to you that I'm working.
p233
aV'Cause we do what it takes to get the job done, most people know that.
p234
aVHere's a concept with this:
p235
aVWe are using the GreenLab for a micro-grid test bed
p236
aVfor the smart grid concept in Ohio.
p237
aVWe have the ability to do that, and I think it's going to work.
p238
aVSo, GreenLab Research Facility.
p239
aVA self-sustainable renewable energy ecosystem was presented today.
p240
aVWe really, really hope this concept catches on worldwide.
p241
aVWe think we have a solution for food, water, fuel and now energy. Complete.
p242
aVIt's extreme green, it's sustainable, alternative and renewable
p243
aVand it meets the big three at GRC:
p244
aVDon't use arable land, don't compete with food crops,
p245
aVand most of all, don't use fresh water.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo I get a lot of questions about, "What are you doing in that lab?"
p248
aVAnd I usually say, "None of your business, that's what I'm doing in the lab." (Laughter)
p249
aVAnd believe it or not, my number one goal
p250
aVfor working on this project is
p251
aVI want to help save the world.

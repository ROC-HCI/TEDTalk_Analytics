VJust to put everything in context,
p5
aVand to kind of give you a background to where I'm coming from,
p6
aVso that a lot of the things I'm going to say,
p7
aVand the things I'm going to do \u2014
p8
aVor things I'm going to tell you I've done \u2014
p9
aVyou will understand exactly why and how I got motivated to be where I am.
p10
aVI graduated high school in Cleveland, Ohio, 1975.
p11
aVAnd just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad, we went back home.
p12
aVFinished university education, got a medical degree, 1986.
p13
aVAnd by the time I was an intern house officer,
p14
aVI could barely afford to maintain my mother's 13-year-old car \u2014
p15
aVand I was a paid doctor.
p16
aVThis brings us to why a lot of us, who are professionals,
p17
aVare now, as they say, in diaspora.
p18
aVNow, are we going to make that a permanent thing,
p19
aVwhere we all get trained, and we leave, and we don't go back?
p20
aVPerhaps not, I should certainly hope not \u2014
p21
aVbecause that is not my vision.
p22
aa(lp23
VAll right, for good measure, that's where Nigeria is on the African map,
p24
aVand just there is the Delta region that I'm sure everybody's heard of.
p25
aVPeople getting kidnapped, where the oil comes from,
p26
aVthe oil that sometimes I think has driven us all crazy in Nigeria.
p27
aVBut, critical poverty: this slide is from a presentation I gave
p28
aVnot that long ago. Gapminder.org tells the story of the gap
p29
aVbetween Africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care.
p30
aVVery interesting.
p31
aa(lp32
VHow many people do you think are on that taxi?
p33
aVAnd believe it or not, that is a taxi in Nigeria.
p34
aVAnd the capital \u2014 well, what used to be the capital of Nigeria \u2014 Lagos,
p35
aVthat's a taxi, and you have police on them.
p36
aVSo, tell me, how many policemen do you think are on this taxi? And now? Three.
p37
aVSo, when these kind of people \u2014 and, believe me, it's not just the police
p38
aVthat use these taxis in Lagos. We all do. I've been on one of these,
p39
aVand I didn't have a helmet, either.
p40
aVAnd it just reminds me of the thought of what happens when one of us
p41
aVon a taxi like this falls off, has an accident and needs a hospital.
p42
aa(lp43
VBelieve it or not, some of us do survive.
p44
aVSome of us do survive malaria; we do survive AIDS.
p45
aVAnd like I tell my family, and my wife reminds me every time,
p46
aV"You're risking your life, you know, every time you go to that country."
p47
aVAnd she's right. Every time you go there,
p48
aVyou know that if you actually need critical care \u2014
p49
aVcritical care of any sort \u2014 if you have an accident \u2014
p50
aVof which there are many, there are accidents everywhere \u2014
p51
aVwhere do they go?
p52
aVWhere do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff?
p53
aVI'm not saying instead of, I'm saying as well as,
p54
aVAIDS, TB, malaria, typhoid \u2014 the list goes on.
p55
aVI'm saying, where do they go when they're like me?
p56
aVWhen I go back home \u2014 and I do all kinds of things,
p57
aVI teach, I train \u2014 but I catch one of these things,
p58
aVor I'm chronically ill with one of those, where do they go?
p59
aVWhat's the economic impact when one of them dies or becomes disabled?
p60
aa(lp61
VI think it's quite significant. This is where they go.
p62
aVThese are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden \u2014
p63
aVthis is a major hospital. In fact, it's from a major teaching hospital in Nigeria.
p64
aVNow that is less than a year old, in an operating room.
p65
aVThat's sterilizing equipment in Nigeria.
p66
aVYou remember all that oil?
p67
aVYes, I'm sorry if it upsets some of you, but
p68
aVI think you need to see this. That's the floor, OK?
p69
aVYou can say some of this is education.
p70
aVYou can say it's hygiene. I'm not pleading poverty.
p71
aVI'm saying we need more than just, you know, vaccination,
p72
aVmalaria, AIDS, because I want to be treated
p73
aVin a proper hospital if something happens to me out there.
p74
aVIn fact, when I start running around saying,
p75
aV"Hey, boys and girls, you're cardiologists in the U.S.,
p76
aVcan you come home with me and do a mission?"
p77
aVI want them to think, "Well there's some hope."
p78
aa(lp79
VNow, have a look at that. That's the anesthesiology machine.
p80
aVAnd that's my specialty, right?
p81
aVAnesthesiology and critical care \u2014 look at that bag.
p82
aVIt's been taped with tape that we even stopped using in the U.K.
p83
aVAnd believe me, these are current pictures.
p84
aVNow, if something like this, which has happened in the U.K.,
p85
aVthat's where they go. This is the intensive care unit in which I work.
p86
aa(lp87
VAll right, this is a slide from a talk I gave
p88
aVabout intensive care units in Nigeria,
p89
aVand jokingly we refer to it as "Expensive Scare."
p90
aVBecause it's scary and it's expensive, but we need to have it, OK?
p91
aVSo, these are the problems.
p92
aVThere are no prizes for telling us what the problems are, are there?
p93
aVI think we all know. And several speakers before
p94
aVand speakers after me are going to tell us even more problems.
p95
aVThese are a few of them. So, what did I do?
p96
aa(lp97
VThere we go \u2014 we're going on a mission.
p98
aVWe're going to do some open-heart surgery. I was the only Brit,
p99
aVon a team of about nine American cardiac surgeons,
p100
aVcardiac nurse, intensive care nurse.
p101
aVWe all went out and did a mission and we've done three of them so far.
p102
aVJust so you know, I do believe in missions, I do believe in aid
p103
aVand I do believe in charity. They have their place,
p104
aVbut where do they go for those things we talked about earlier?
p105
aVBecause it's not everyone that's going to benefit from a mission.
p106
aVHealth is wealth, in the words of Hans Rosling.
p107
aVYou get wealthier faster if you are healthy first.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo, here we are, mission. Big trouble.
p110
aVOpen-heart surgery in Nigeria \u2014 big trouble.
p111
aVThat's Mike, Mike comes out from Mississippi.
p112
aVDoes he look like he's happy?
p113
aVIt took us two days just to organize the place, but hey,
p114
aVyou know, we worked on it. Does he look happy?
p115
aVYes, that's the medical advice the committee chairman says,
p116
aV"Yes, I told you, you weren't going to be able to,
p117
aVyou can't do this, I just know it."
p118
aVLook, that's the technician we had. So yes, you go on, all right?
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VI got him to come with me \u2014 anesthesia tech \u2014 come with me from the U.K.
p123
aVYes, let's just go work this thing out.
p124
aVSee, that's one of the problems we have in Nigeria and in Africa generally.
p125
aVWe get a lot of donated equipment.
p126
aVEquipment that's obsolete, equipment that doesn't quite work,
p127
aVor it works and you can't fix it. And there's nothing wrong with that,
p128
aVso long as we use it and we move on.
p129
aa(lp130
VBut we had problems with it. We had severe problems there.
p131
aVHe had to get on the phone. This guy was always on the phone.
p132
aVSo what we going to do now?
p133
aVIt looks like all these Americans are here and
p134
aVyes, one Brit, and he's not going to do anything \u2014
p135
aVhe thinks he's British actually, and he's actually Nigerian,
p136
aVI just thought about that.
p137
aVWe eventually got it working, is the truth,
p138
aVbut it was one of these. Even older than the one you saw.
p139
aa(lp140
VThe reason I have this picture here, this X-ray,
p141
aVit's just to tell you where and how we were viewing X-rays.
p142
aVDo you figure where that is? It was on a window.
p143
aVI mean, what's an X-ray viewing box? Please.
p144
aVWell, nowadays everything's on PAX anyway.
p145
aVYou look at your X-rays on a screen and you do stuff with them,
p146
aVyou email them. But we were still using X-rays,
p147
aVbut we didn't even have a viewing box!
p148
aVAnd we were doing open-heart surgery.
p149
aa(lp150
VOK, I know it's not AIDS, I know it's not malaria,
p151
aVbut we still need this stuff. Oh yeah, echo \u2014
p152
aVthis was just to get the children ready and the adults ready.
p153
aVPeople still believe in Voodoo. Heart disease,
p154
aVVSD, hole in the heart, tetralogies.
p155
aVYou still get people who believe in it and they came.
p156
aVAt 67 percent oxygen saturation, the normal is about 97.
p157
aVHer condition, open-heart surgery that as she required,
p158
aVwould have been treated when she was a child.
p159
aVWe had to do these for adults. So, we did succeed and we still do.
p160
aVWe've done three. We're planning another one in July
p161
aVin the north of the country. So, we certainly still do open-heart,
p162
aVbut you can see the contrast between everything that was shipped in \u2014
p163
aVwe ship everything, instruments. We had explosions
p164
aVbecause the kit was designed and installed by people who weren't used to it.
p165
aVThe oxygen tanks didn't quite work right.
p166
aa(lp167
VBut how many did we do the first one? 12.
p168
aVWe did 12 open-heart surgical patients successfully.
p169
aVHere is our very first patient, out of intensive care,
p170
aVand just watch that chair, all right?
p171
aVThis is what I mean about appropriate technology.
p172
aVThat's what he was doing, propping up the bed because the bed simply didn't work.
p173
aVHave you seen one of those before?
p174
aVNo? Yes? Doesn't matter, it worked.
p175
aVI'm sure you've all seen or heard this before:
p176
aV"We, the willing, have been doing so much with so little for so long \u2014
p177
aa(lp178
V(Applause)
p179
aV\u2014 we are now qualified to do anything with nothing."
p180
aa(lp181
V(Applause)
p182
aa(lp183
VThank you. Sustainable Solutions \u2014 this was my first company.
p184
aVThis one's sole aim is to provide the very things that I think are missing.
p185
aVSo, we put my hand in my pocket and say, "Guys, let's just buy stuff.
p186
aVLet's go set up a company that teaches people, educates them,
p187
aVgives them the tools they need to keep going."
p188
aa(lp189
VAnd that's a perfect example of one.
p190
aVUsually when you buy a ventilator in a hospital,
p191
aVyou buy a different one for children,
p192
aVyou buy a different one for transport. This one will do everything,
p193
aVand it will do it at half the price and doesn't need compressed air.
p194
aVIf you're in America and you don't know about this one, we do,
p195
aVbecause we make it our duty to find out
p196
aVwhat's appropriate technology for Africa \u2014 what's appropriately priced,
p197
aVdoes the job, and we move on. Anesthesia machine:
p198
aVmulti-parameter monitor, operating lights, suction.
p199
aVThis little unit here \u2014 remember your little 12-volt plug in the car,
p200
aVthat charges your, whatever, Game Boy, telephone?
p201
aVThat's exactly how the outlets are designed.
p202
aVYes, it will take a solar panel. Yes a solar panel will charge it.
p203
aVBut if you've got mains as well, it will charge the batteries in there.
p204
aVAnd guess what? We have a little pedal charger too, just in case.
p205
aVAnd guess what, if it all fails,
p206
aVif you can find a car that's still got a live battery
p207
aVand you stick it in, it will still work. Then you can customize it.
p208
aVIs it dental surgery you want? General surgery you want?
p209
aVDecide which instruments, stock it up with consumables.
p210
aa(lp211
VAnd currently we're working on oxygen \u2014 oxygen delivery on-site.
p212
aVThe technology for oxygen delivery is not new.
p213
aVOxygen concentrators are very old technology. What is new,
p214
aVand what we will have in a few months, I hope,
p215
aVis that ability to use this same renewable energy system
p216
aVto provide and produce oxygen on site. Zeolite \u2014 it's not new \u2014
p217
aVzeolite removes nitrogen from air and nitrogen is 78 percent of air.
p218
aVIf you take nitrogen out, what's left? Oxygen, pretty much.
p219
aVSo that's not new. What we're doing is applying this technology to it.
p220
aa(lp221
VThese are the basic features of my device, or our device.
p222
aVThis is what makes it so special.
p223
aVApart from the awards it's won,
p224
aVit's portable and it's certified. It's registered, the MHRA \u2014
p225
aVand the CE mark, for those who don't know, for Europe, is the equivalent
p226
aVof the FDA in the U.S.
p227
aVIf you compare it with what's on the market, price-wise,
p228
aVsize-wise, ease of use, complexity ...
p229
aa(lp230
VThis picture was taken last year.
p231
aVThese are members of my graduating class, 1986.
p232
aVIt was in this gentleman's house in the Potomac,
p233
aVfor those of you who are familiar with Maryland.
p234
aVThere are too many of us outside and everybody,
p235
aVjust to borrow a bit from Hans \u2014 Hans Rosling, he's my guy \u2014
p236
aVif the size of the text represents what gets the most attention,
p237
aVit's the problems. But what we really need are African solutions
p238
aVthat are appropriate for Africa \u2014 looking at the culture,
p239
aVlooking at the people, looking at how much money they've got.
p240
aVAfrican people, because they will do it with a passion, I hope.
p241
aVAnd lots and lots of that little bit down there, sacrifice.
p242
aVYou have to do it. Africans have to do it,
p243
aVin conjunction with everyone else.
p244
aa(lp245
VThank you.

VWe live in an incredibly busy world.
p5
aVThe pace of life is often frantic, our minds are always busy,
p6
aVand we're always doing something.
p7
aa(lp8
VSo with that in mind, I'd like you just to take a moment
p9
aVto think, when did you last take any time to do nothing?
p10
aVJust 10 minutes, undisturbed?
p11
aVAnd when I say nothing, I do mean nothing.
p12
aVSo that's no emailing, texting, no Internet,
p13
aVno TV, no chatting, no eating, no reading.
p14
aVNot even sitting there reminiscing about the past
p15
aVor planning for the future.
p16
aVSimply doing nothing.
p17
aVI see a lot of very blank faces.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VYou probably have to go a long way back.
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd this is an extraordinary thing, right?
p24
aVWe're talking about our mind.
p25
aVThe mind, our most valuable and precious resource,
p26
aVthrough which we experience every single moment of our life.
p27
aVThe mind that we rely upon
p28
aVto be happy, content, emotionally stable as individuals,
p29
aVand at the same time, to be kind and thoughtful
p30
aVand considerate in our relationships with others.
p31
aVThis is the same mind that we depend upon
p32
aVto be focused, creative, spontaneous,
p33
aVand to perform at our very best in everything that we do.
p34
aVAnd yet, we don't take any time out to look after it.
p35
aVIn fact, we spend more time looking after our cars,
p36
aVour clothes and our hair than we \u2014
p37
aVokay, maybe not our hair,
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
Vbut you see where I'm going.
p42
aa(lp43
VThe result, of course, is that we get stressed.
p44
aVYou know, the mind whizzes away like a washing machine
p45
aVgoing round and round, lots of difficult, confusing emotions,
p46
aVand we don't really know how to deal with that.
p47
aVAnd the sad fact is that we are so distracted
p48
aVthat we're no longer present in the world in which we live.
p49
aVWe miss out on the things that are most important to us,
p50
aVand the crazy thing is that everybody just assumes,
p51
aVthat's the way life is, so we've just kind of got to get on with it.
p52
aVThat's really not how it has to be.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo I was about 11 when I went along to my first meditation class.
p55
aVAnd trust me, it had all the stereotypes that you can imagine,
p56
aVthe sitting cross-legged on the floor,
p57
aVthe incense, the herbal tea, the vegetarians, the whole deal,
p58
aVbut my mom was going and I was intrigued, so I went along with her.
p59
aVI'd also seen a few kung fu movies,
p60
aVand secretly I kind of thought I might be able to learn how to fly,
p61
aVbut I was very young at the time.
p62
aVNow as I was there, I guess, like a lot of people,
p63
aVI assumed that it was just an aspirin for the mind.
p64
aVYou get stressed, you do some meditation.
p65
aVI hadn't really thought that it could be sort of preventative in nature,
p66
aVuntil I was about 20, when a number of things happened in my life
p67
aVin quite quick succession,
p68
aVreally serious things which just flipped my life upside down
p69
aVand all of a sudden I was inundated with thoughts,
p70
aVinundated with difficult emotions that I didn't know how to cope with.
p71
aVEvery time I sort of pushed one down,
p72
aVanother one would pop back up again.
p73
aVIt was a really very stressful time.
p74
aa(lp75
VI guess we all deal with stress in different ways.
p76
aVSome people will bury themselves in work, grateful for the distraction.
p77
aVOthers will turn to their friends, their family, looking for support.
p78
aVSome people hit the bottle, start taking medication.
p79
aVMy own way of dealing with it was to become a monk.
p80
aVSo I quit my degree, I headed off to the Himalayas,
p81
aVI became a monk, and I started studying meditation.
p82
aa(lp83
VPeople often ask me what I learned from that time.
p84
aVWell, obviously it changed things.
p85
aVLet's face it, becoming a celibate monk is going to change a number of things.
p86
aVBut it was more than that.
p87
aVIt taught me \u2014 it gave me a greater appreciation,
p88
aVan understanding for the present moment.
p89
aVBy that I mean not being lost in thought,
p90
aVnot being distracted,
p91
aVnot being overwhelmed by difficult emotions,
p92
aVbut instead learning how to be in the here and now,
p93
aVhow to be mindful, how to be present.
p94
aa(lp95
VI think the present moment is so underrated.
p96
aVIt sounds so ordinary,
p97
aVand yet we spend so little time in the present moment
p98
aVthat it's anything but ordinary.
p99
aVThere was a research paper that came out of Harvard, just recently,
p100
aVthat said on average, our minds are lost in thought
p101
aValmost 47 percent of the time.
p102
aV47 percent.
p103
aVAt the same time, this sort of constant mind-wandering
p104
aVis also a direct cause of unhappiness.
p105
aVNow we're not here for that long anyway,
p106
aVbut to spend almost half of our life lost in thought
p107
aVand potentially quite unhappy,
p108
aVI don't know, it just kind of seems tragic, actually,
p109
aVespecially when there's something we can do about it,
p110
aVwhen there's a positive, practical, achievable,
p111
aVscientifically proven technique
p112
aVwhich allows our mind to be more healthy,
p113
aVto be more mindful and less distracted.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd the beauty of it is that even though
p116
aVit need only take about 10 minutes a day,
p117
aVit impacts our entire life.
p118
aVBut we need to know how to do it.
p119
aVWe need an exercise.
p120
aVWe need a framework to learn how to be more mindful.
p121
aVThat's essentially what meditation is.
p122
aVIt's familiarizing ourselves with the present moment.
p123
aVBut we also need to know how to approach it in the right way
p124
aVto get the best from it.
p125
aVAnd that's what these are for, in case you've been wondering,
p126
aVbecause most people assume
p127
aVthat meditation is all about stopping thoughts,
p128
aVgetting rid of emotions, somehow controlling the mind,
p129
aVbut actually it's quite different from that.
p130
aVIt's more about stepping back,
p131
aVsort of seeing the thought clearly,
p132
aVwitnessing it coming and going, emotions coming and going
p133
aVwithout judgment, but with a relaxed, focused mind.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo for example, right now,
p136
aVif I focus too much on the balls,
p137
aVthen there's no way I can relax and talk to you at the same time.
p138
aVEqually, if I relax too much talking to you,
p139
aVthere's no way I can focus on the balls.
p140
aVI'm going to drop them.
p141
aVNow in life, and in meditation,
p142
aVthere'll be times when the focus becomes a little bit too intense,
p143
aVand life starts to feel a bit like this.
p144
aVIt's a very uncomfortable way to live life,
p145
aVwhen you get this tight and stressed.
p146
aVAt other times, we might take our foot off the gas a little bit too much,
p147
aVand things just become a sort of little bit like this.
p148
aVOf course in meditation \u2014
p149
aa(lp150
V(Snores)
p151
aa(lp152
Vwe're going to end up falling asleep.
p153
aVSo we're looking for a balance, a focused relaxation
p154
aVwhere we can allow thoughts to come and go
p155
aVwithout all the usual involvement.
p156
aa(lp157
VNow, what usually happens when we're learning to be mindful
p158
aVis that we get distracted by a thought.
p159
aVLet's say this is an anxious thought.
p160
aVEverything's going fine, and we see the anxious thought.
p161
aV"Oh, I didn't realize I was worried about that."
p162
aVYou go back to it, repeat it.
p163
aV"Oh, I am worried.
p164
aVI really am worried. Wow, there's so much anxiety."
p165
aVAnd before we know it, right,
p166
aVwe're anxious about feeling anxious.
p167
aa(lp168
V(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VYou know, this is crazy.
p171
aVWe do this all the time, even on an everyday level.
p172
aVIf you think about the last time you had a wobbly tooth.
p173
aVYou know it's wobbly, and you know that it hurts.
p174
aVBut what do you do every 20, 30 seconds?
p175
aa(lp176
V(Mumbling)
p177
aa(lp178
VIt does hurt.
p179
aVAnd we reinforce the storyline, right?
p180
aVAnd we just keep telling ourselves, and we do it all the time.
p181
aVAnd it's only in learning to watch the mind in this way
p182
aVthat we can start to let go of those storylines and patterns of mind.
p183
aVBut when you sit down and you watch the mind in this way,
p184
aVyou might see many different patterns.
p185
aVYou might find a mind that's really restless and \u2014
p186
aVthe whole time.
p187
aVDon't be surprised if you feel a bit agitated in your body
p188
aVwhen you sit down to do nothing and your mind feels like that.
p189
aVYou might find a mind that's very dull
p190
aVand boring, and it's just, almost mechanical,
p191
aVit just seems it's as if you're getting up, going to work,
p192
aVeat, sleep, get up, work.
p193
aVOr it might just be that one little nagging thought
p194
aVthat just goes round and round your mind.
p195
aa(lp196
VWell, whatever it is,
p197
aVmeditation offers the opportunity, the potential to step back
p198
aVand to get a different perspective,
p199
aVto see that things aren't always as they appear.
p200
aVWe can't change every little thing that happens to us in life,
p201
aVbut we can change the way that we experience it.
p202
aVThat's the potential of meditation, of mindfulness.
p203
aVYou don't have to burn any incense,
p204
aVand you definitely don't have to sit on the floor.
p205
aVAll you need to do is to take 10 minutes out a day
p206
aVto step back, to familiarize yourself with the present moment
p207
aVso that you get to experience a greater sense
p208
aVof focus, calm and clarity in your life.
p209
aa(lp210
VThank you very much.

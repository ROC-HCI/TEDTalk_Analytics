VIn 2002, a group of treatment activists met
p5
aVto discuss the early development of the airplane.
p6
aVThe Wright Brothers, in the beginning of the last century,
p7
aVhad for the first time managed
p8
aVto make one of those devices fly.
p9
aVThey also had taken out numerous patents
p10
aVon essential parts of the airplane.
p11
aVThey were not the only ones.
p12
aVThat was common practice in the industry,
p13
aVand those who held patents on airplanes
p14
aVwere defending them fiercely
p15
aVand suing competitors left and right.
p16
aa(lp17
VThis actually wasn't so great for the development of the aviation industry,
p18
aVand this was at a time that in particular the U.S. government
p19
aVwas interested in ramping up
p20
aVthe production of military airplanes.
p21
aVSo there was a bit of a conflict there.
p22
aVThe U.S. government decided to take action,
p23
aVand forced those patent holders
p24
aVto make their patents available to share with others
p25
aVto enable the production of airplanes.
p26
aa(lp27
VSo what has this
p28
aVgot to do with this?
p29
aa(lp30
VIn 2002, Nelson Otwoma, a Kenyan social scientist,
p31
aVdiscovered he had HIV and needed access to treatment.
p32
aVHe was told that a cure did not exist.
p33
aVAIDS, he heard, was lethal,
p34
aVand treatment was not offered. This was at a time
p35
aVthat treatment actually existed in rich countries.
p36
aVAIDS had become a chronic disease.
p37
aVPeople in our countries here in Europe, in North America,
p38
aVwere living with HIV, healthy lives.
p39
aVNot so for Nelson. He wasn't rich enough,
p40
aVand not so for his three-year-old son, who he discovered a year later
p41
aValso had HIV.
p42
aa(lp43
VNelson decided to become a treatment activist
p44
aVand join up with other groups.
p45
aVIn 2002, they were facing a different battle.
p46
aVPrices for ARVs, the drugs needed to treat HIV,
p47
aVcost about 12,000 [dollars] per patient per year.
p48
aVThe patents on those drugs were held
p49
aVby a number of Western pharmaceutical companies
p50
aVthat were not necessarily willing
p51
aVto make those patents available.
p52
aVWhen you have a patent, you can exclude
p53
aVanyone else from making, from producing or making
p54
aVlow-cost versions, for example,
p55
aVavailable of those medications.
p56
aVClearly this led to patent wars breaking out
p57
aVall over the globe.
p58
aa(lp59
VLuckily, those patents did not exist everywhere.
p60
aVThere were countries that did not recognize
p61
aVpharmaceutical product patents, such as India,
p62
aVand Indian pharmaceutical companies
p63
aVstarted to produce so-called generic versions,
p64
aVlow-cost copies of antiretroviral medicines,
p65
aVand make them available in the developing world,
p66
aVand within a year the price had come down
p67
aVfrom 10,000 dollars per patient per year
p68
aVto 350 dollars per patient per year,
p69
aVand today that same triple pill cocktail
p70
aVis available for 60 dollars per patient per year,
p71
aVand of course that started to have an enormous effect
p72
aVon the number of people who could afford access
p73
aVto those medicines.
p74
aVTreatment programs became possible,
p75
aVfunding became available, and the number of people
p76
aVon antiretroviral drugs started to increase very rapidly.
p77
aa(lp78
VToday, eight million people
p79
aVhave access to antiretroviral drugs.
p80
aVThirty-four million are infected with HIV.
p81
aVNever has this number been so high,
p82
aVbut actually this is good news,
p83
aVbecause what it means is people stop dying.
p84
aVPeople who have access to these drugs stop dying.
p85
aVAnd there's something else.
p86
aVThey also stop passing on the virus.
p87
aVThis is fairly recent science that has shown that.
p88
aVWhat that means is we have the tools
p89
aVto break the back of this epidemic.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo what's the problem?
p92
aVWell, things have changed.
p93
aVFirst of all, the rules have changed.
p94
aVToday, all countries are obliged to provide
p95
aVpatents for pharmaceuticals that last at least 20 years.
p96
aVThis is as a result of the intellectual property rules
p97
aVof the World Trade Organization.
p98
aVSo what India did is no longer possible.
p99
aVSecond, the practice of patent-holding companies have changed.
p100
aVHere you see the patent practices
p101
aVbefore the World Trade Organization's rules, before '95,
p102
aVbefore antiretroviral drugs.
p103
aVThis is what you see today,
p104
aVand this is in developing countries, so what that means is,
p105
aVunless we do something deliberate
p106
aVand unless we do something now,
p107
aVwe will very soon be faced with another drug price crisis,
p108
aVbecause new drugs are developed,
p109
aVnew drugs go to market, but these medicines are patented
p110
aVin a much wider range of countries.
p111
aVSo unless we act, unless we do something today,
p112
aVwe will soon be faced [with] what some have termed
p113
aVthe treatment time bomb.
p114
aa(lp115
VIt isn't only the number of drugs that are patented.
p116
aVThere's something else that can really scare
p117
aVgeneric manufacturers away.
p118
aVThis shows you a patent landscape.
p119
aVThis is the landscape of one medicine.
p120
aVSo you can imagine that if you are a generic company
p121
aVabout to decide whether to invest
p122
aVin the development of this product, unless you know
p123
aVthat the licenses to these patents
p124
aVare actually going to be available,
p125
aVyou will probably choose to do something else.
p126
aVAgain, deliberate action is needed.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo surely
p129
aVif a patent pool could be established
p130
aVto ramp up the production of military airplanes,
p131
aVwe should be able to do something similar
p132
aVto tackle the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd we did.
p135
aVIn 2010, UNITAID established the Medicines Patent Pool
p136
aVfor HIV.
p137
aVAnd this is how it works:
p138
aVPatent holders, inventors
p139
aVthat develop new medicines
p140
aVpatent those inventions,
p141
aVbut make those patents available
p142
aVto the Medicines Patent Pool. The Medicines Patent Pool
p143
aVthen license those out to whoever needs access to those patents.
p144
aVThat can be generic manufacturers.
p145
aVIt can also be not-for-profit drug development agencies,
p146
aVfor example.
p147
aVThose manufacturers can then sell those medicines
p148
aVat much lower cost to people who need access to them,
p149
aVto treatment programs that need access to them.
p150
aVThey pay royalties over the sales to the patent holders,
p151
aVso they are remunerated for sharing their intellectual property.
p152
aa(lp153
VThere is one key difference
p154
aVwith the airplane patent pool.
p155
aVThe Medicines Patent Pool is a voluntary mechanism.
p156
aVThe airplane patent holders were not left a choice
p157
aVwhether they'd license their patents or not.
p158
aVThey were forced to do so.
p159
aVThat is something that the Medicines Patent Pool cannot do.
p160
aVIt relies on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies
p161
aVto license their patents and make them available
p162
aVfor others to use.
p163
aa(lp164
VToday, Nelson Otwoma is healthy.
p165
aVHe has access to antiretroviral drugs.
p166
aVHis son will soon be 14 years old.
p167
aVNelson is a member of the expert advisory group
p168
aVof the Medicines Patent Pool,
p169
aVand he told me not so long ago,
p170
aV"Ellen, we rely in Kenya and in many other countries
p171
aVon the Medicines Patent Pool to make sure
p172
aVthat new medicines also become available to us,
p173
aVthat new medicines, without delay, become available to us."
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd this is no longer fantasy.
p176
aVAlready, I'll give you an example.
p177
aVIn August of this year, the United States drug agency
p178
aVapproved a new four-in-one AIDS medication.
p179
aVThe company, Gilead, that holds the patents,
p180
aVhas licensed the intellectual property to the Medicines Patent Pool.
p181
aVThe pool is already working today, two months later,
p182
aVwith generic manufacturers to make sure that this product
p183
aVcan go to market at low cost
p184
aVwhere and when it is needed. This is unprecedented.
p185
aVThis has never been done before.
p186
aVThe rule is about a 10-year delay for a new product
p187
aVto go to market in developing countries, if at all.
p188
aVThis has never been seen before.
p189
aVNelson's expectations are very high,
p190
aVand quite rightly so. He and his son will need access
p191
aVto the next generation of antiretrovirals
p192
aVand the next, throughout their lifetime,
p193
aVso that he and many others in Kenya and other countries
p194
aVcan continue to live healthy, active lives.
p195
aa(lp196
VNow we count on the willingness of drug companies
p197
aVto make that happen. We count on those companies
p198
aVthat understand that it is in the interest, not only in the interest
p199
aVof the global good, but also in their own interest,
p200
aVto move from conflict to collaboration,
p201
aVand through the Medicines Patent Pool they can make that happen.
p202
aVThey can also choose not to do that,
p203
aVbut those that go down that road may end up
p204
aVin a similar situation the Wright brothers ended up with
p205
aVearly last century, facing forcible measures
p206
aVby government. So they'd better jump now.
p207
aVThank you. (Applause)

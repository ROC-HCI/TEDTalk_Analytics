VSo, indeed, I have spent my life
p5
aVlooking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive.
p6
aVWaking up with Abraham Lincoln in the morning,
p7
aVthinking of Franklin Roosevelt when I went to bed at night.
p8
aVBut when I try and think about what I've learned
p9
aVabout the meaning in life, my mind keeps wandering back
p10
aVto a seminar that I took when I was a graduate student at Harvard
p11
aVwith the great psychologist Erik Erikson.
p12
aa(lp13
VHe taught us that the richest and fullest lives
p14
aVattempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms:
p15
aVwork, love and play.
p16
aVAnd that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the other,
p17
aVis to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age.
p18
aVWhereas to pursue all three with equal dedication,
p19
aVis to make possible a life filled not only with achievement,
p20
aVbut with serenity.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo since I tell stories, let me look back
p23
aVon the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point \u2014
p24
aVAbraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson.
p25
aVAs for that first sphere of work,
p26
aVI think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggests
p27
aVis that fierce ambition is a good thing.
p28
aVHe had a huge ambition.
p29
aVBut it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame \u2014
p30
aVwhat it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life
p31
aVso that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it.
p32
aa(lp33
VEven as a child, it seemed, Lincoln dreamed heroic dreams.
p34
aVHe somehow had to escape that hard-scrabble farm
p35
aVfrom which he was born.
p36
aVNo schooling was possible for him,
p37
aVexcept a few weeks here, a few weeks there.
p38
aVBut he read books in every spare moment he could find.
p39
aVIt was said when he got a copy of the King James Bible
p40
aVor "Aesop's Fables," he was so excited he couldn't sleep.
p41
aVHe couldn't eat.
p42
aVThe great poet Emily Dickinson once said,
p43
aV"There is no frigate like a book to take us lands away."
p44
aVHow true for Lincoln.
p45
aa(lp46
VThough he never would travel to Europe,
p47
aVhe went with Shakespeare's kings to merry England,
p48
aVhe went with Lord Byron's poetry to Spain and Portugal.
p49
aVLiterature allowed him to transcend his surroundings.
p50
aVBut there were so many losses in his early life
p51
aVthat he was haunted by death.
p52
aVHis mother died when he was only nine years old;
p53
aVhis only sister, Sarah, in childbirth a few years later;
p54
aVand his first love, Ann Rutledge, at the age of 22.
p55
aVMoreover, when his mother lay dying,
p56
aVshe did not hold out for him the hope
p57
aVthat they would meet in an afterworld.
p58
aVShe simply said to him,
p59
aV"Abraham, I'm going away from you now, and I shall never return."
p60
aVAs a result he became obsessed with the thought
p61
aVthat when we die our life is swept away \u2014 dust to dust.
p62
aa(lp63
VBut only as he grew older did he develop
p64
aVa certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion \u2014
p65
aVbut followed by other cultures as well \u2014
p66
aVthat if you could accomplish something worthy in your life,
p67
aVyou could live on in the memory of others.
p68
aVYour honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence.
p69
aVAnd that worthy ambition became his lodestar.
p70
aVIt carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered
p71
aVwhen he was in his early 30s.
p72
aa(lp73
VThree things had combined to lay him low.
p74
aVHe had broken his engagement with Mary Todd,
p75
aVnot certain he was ready to marry her,
p76
aVbut knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that.
p77
aVHis one intimate friend, Joshua Speed, was leaving Illinois
p78
aVto go back to Kentucky because Speed's father had died.
p79
aVAnd his political career in the state legislature
p80
aVwas on a downward slide.
p81
aVHe was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal.
p82
aVThey took all knives and razors and scissors from his room.
p83
aVAnd his great friend Speed went to his side and said,
p84
aV"Lincoln, you must rally or you will die."
p85
aVHe said that, "I would just as soon die right now,
p86
aVbut I've not yet done anything to make any human being
p87
aVremember that I have lived."
p88
aa(lp89
VSo fueled by that ambition, he returned to the state legislature.
p90
aVHe eventually won a seat in Congress.
p91
aVHe then ran twice for the Senate, lost twice.
p92
aV"Everyone is broken by life," Ernest Hemingway once said,
p93
aV"but some people are stronger in the broken places."
p94
aVSo then he surprised the nation with an upset victory
p95
aVfor the presidency over three far more experienced,
p96
aVfar more educated, far more celebrated rivals.
p97
aVAnd then when he won the general election,
p98
aVhe stunned the nation even more
p99
aVby appointing each of these three rivals into his Cabinet.
p100
aVIt was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought,
p101
aV"He'll look like a figurehead compared to these people."
p102
aVThey said, "Why are you doing this, Lincoln?"
p103
aVHe said, "Look, these are the strongest
p104
aVand most able men in the country.
p105
aVThe country is in peril. I need them by my side."
p106
aVBut perhaps my old friend Lyndon Johnson
p107
aVmight have put it in less noble fashion:
p108
aV"Better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out,
p109
aVthan outside the tent pissing in."
p110
aV(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VBut it soon became clear that Abraham Lincoln
p113
aVwould emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team.
p114
aVFor each of them soon came to understand
p115
aVthat he possessed an unparalleled array of
p116
aVemotional strengths and political skills
p117
aVthat proved far more important than the thinness of his external résumé.
p118
aVFor one thing, he possessed an uncanny ability
p119
aVto empathize with and to think about other peoples' point of view.
p120
aVHe repaired injured feelings that might have escalated
p121
aVinto permanent hostility.
p122
aVHe shared credit with ease,
p123
aVassumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates,
p124
aVconstantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes.
p125
aVThese are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in 2008.
p126
aV(Applause)
p127
aVHe refused to be provoked by petty grievances.
p128
aVHe never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights.
p129
aVAnd he expressed his unshakeable convictions
p130
aVin everyday language, in metaphors, in stories.
p131
aVAnd with a beauty of language \u2014 almost as if
p132
aVthe Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child
p133
aVhad worked their way into his very soul.
p134
aa(lp135
VIn 1863, when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed,
p136
aVhe brought his old friend, Joshua Speed, back to the White House,
p137
aVand remembered that conversation of decades before, when he was so sad.
p138
aVAnd he, pointing to the Proclamation, said,
p139
aV"I believe, in this measure, my fondest hopes will be realized."
p140
aVBut as he was about to put his signature on the Proclamation
p141
aVhis own hand was numb and shaking
p142
aVbecause he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a New Year's reception.
p143
aVSo he put the pen down.
p144
aVHe said, "If ever my soul were in an act, it is in this act.
p145
aVBut if I sign with a shaking hand,
p146
aVposterity will say, 'He hesitated.'"
p147
aVSo he waited until he could take up the pen
p148
aVand sign with a bold and clear hand.
p149
aVBut even in his wildest dreams,
p150
aVLincoln could never have imagined
p151
aVhow far his reputation would reach.
p152
aa(lp153
VI was so thrilled to find an interview with the great Russian writer,
p154
aVLeo Tolstoy, in a New York newspaper in the early 1900s.
p155
aVAnd in it, Tolstoy told of a trip that he'd recently made
p156
aVto a very remote area of the Caucasus,
p157
aVwhere there were only wild barbarians,
p158
aVwho had never left this part of Russia.
p159
aVKnowing that Tolstoy was in their midst,
p160
aVthey asked him to tell stories of the great men of history.
p161
aVSo he said, "I told them about Napoleon
p162
aVand Alexander the Great and Frederick the Great
p163
aVand Julius Caesar, and they loved it.
p164
aVBut before I finished, the chief of the barbarians stood up and said,
p165
aV'But wait, you haven't told us about the greatest ruler of them all.
p166
aVWe want to hear about that man who spoke with a voice of thunder,
p167
aVwho laughed like the sunrise,
p168
aVwho came from that place called America, which is so far from here,
p169
aVthat if a young man should travel there,
p170
aVhe would be an old man when he arrived.
p171
aVTell us of that man. Tell us of Abraham Lincoln.'"
p172
aVHe was stunned.
p173
aVHe told them everything he could about Lincoln.
p174
aVAnd then in the interview he said, "What made Lincoln so great?
p175
aVNot as great a general as Napoleon,
p176
aVnot as great a statesman as Frederick the Great."
p177
aVBut his greatness consisted, and historians would roundly agree,
p178
aVin the integrity of his character
p179
aVand the moral fiber of his being.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo in the end that powerful ambition
p182
aVthat had carried Lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized.
p183
aVThat ambition that had allowed him to laboriously educate himself by himself,
p184
aVto go through that string of political failures
p185
aVand the darkest days of the war.
p186
aVHis story would be told.
p187
aVSo as for that second sphere, not of work, but of love \u2014
p188
aVencompassing family, friends and colleagues \u2014
p189
aVit, too, takes work and commitment.
p190
aVThe Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life,
p191
aVwhen I helped him on his memoirs,
p192
aVwas a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of
p193
aVwork, power and individual success,
p194
aVthat he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left
p195
aVto get him through the days
p196
aVonce the presidency was gone.
p197
aa(lp198
VMy relationship with him began on a rather curious level.
p199
aVI was selected as a White House Fellow when I was 24 years old.
p200
aVWe had a big dance at the White House.
p201
aVPresident Johnson did dance with me that night.
p202
aVNot that peculiar \u2014
p203
aVthere were only three women out of the 16 White House Fellows.
p204
aVBut he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me
p205
aVto work directly for him in the White House.
p206
aVBut it was not to be that simple.
p207
aVFor in the months leading up to my selection,
p208
aVlike many young people, I'd been active
p209
aVin the anti-Vietnam War movement,
p210
aVand had written an article against Lyndon Johnson,
p211
aVwhich unfortunately came out in The New Republic
p212
aVtwo days after the dance in the White House.
p213
aV(Laugher)
p214
aVAnd the theme of the article was how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power.
p215
aV(Laughter)
p216
aVSo I was certain he would kick me out of the program.
p217
aVBut instead, surprisingly, he said,
p218
aV"Oh, bring her down here for a year,
p219
aVand if I can't win her over, no one can."
p220
aVSo I did end up working for him in the White House.
p221
aVEventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs,
p222
aVnever fully understanding why he'd chosen me to spend so many hours with.
p223
aa(lp224
VI like to believe it was because I was a good listener.
p225
aVHe was a great storyteller.
p226
aVFabulous, colorful, anecdotal stories.
p227
aVThere was a problem with these stories, however,
p228
aVwhich I later discovered, which is that half of them weren't true.
p229
aVBut they were great, nonetheless.
p230
aV(Laughter)
p231
aVSo I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales.
p232
aVBut I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman.
p233
aVAnd he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation.
p234
aVSo I constantly chatted to him about boyfriends,
p235
aVeven when I didn't have any at all.
p236
aa(lp237
VEverything was working perfectly,
p238
aVuntil one day he said he wanted to discuss our relationship.
p239
aVSounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake,
p240
aVconveniently called Lake Lyndon Baines Johnson.
p241
aVAnd there was wine and cheese and a red-checked tablecloth \u2014
p242
aVall the romantic trappings.
p243
aVAnd he started out,
p244
aV"Doris, more than any other woman I have ever known ... "
p245
aVAnd my heart sank.
p246
aVAnd then he said,
p247
aV"You remind me of my mother."
p248
aV(Laughter)
p249
aa(lp250
VIt was pretty embarrassing, given what was going on in my mind.
p251
aVBut I must say, the older I've gotten,
p252
aVthe more I realize what an incredible privilege it was
p253
aVto have spent so many hours with this aging lion of a man.
p254
aVA victor in a thousand contests,
p255
aVthree great civil rights laws, Medicare, aid to education.
p256
aVAnd yet, roundly defeated in the end by the war in Vietnam.
p257
aVAnd because he was so sad and so vulnerable,
p258
aVhe opened up to me in ways he never would have
p259
aVhad I known him at the height of his power \u2014
p260
aVsharing his fears, his sorrows and his worries.
p261
aVAnd I'd like to believe that the privilege fired within me
p262
aVthe drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure,
p263
aVthat I've tried to bring to each of my books since then.
p264
aa(lp265
VBut it also brought home to me the lessons
p266
aVwhich Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of us
p267
aVabout the importance of finding balance in life.
p268
aVFor on the surface, Lyndon Johnson should have had
p269
aVeverything in the world to feel good about in those last years,
p270
aVin the sense that he had been elected to the presidency;
p271
aVhe had all the money he needed to pursue
p272
aVany leisure activity he wanted;
p273
aVhe owned a spacious ranch in the countryside, a penthouse in the city,
p274
aVsailboats, speedboats.
p275
aVHe had servants to answer any whim,
p276
aVand he had a family who loved him deeply.
p277
aa(lp278
VAnd yet, years of concentration solely on work and individual success
p279
aVmeant that in his retirement he could find no solace
p280
aVin family, in recreation, in sports or in hobbies.
p281
aVIt was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large
p282
aVthat even the love of a family, without work, could not fill it.
p283
aVAs his spirits sagged, his body deteriorated
p284
aVuntil, I believe, he slowly brought about his own death.
p285
aVIn those last years, he said he was so sad
p286
aVwatching the American people look toward a new president and forgetting him.
p287
aVHe spoke with immense sadness in his voice,
p288
aVsaying maybe he should have spent more time with his children,
p289
aVand their children in turn.
p290
aVBut it was too late.
p291
aVDespite all that power, all that wealth,
p292
aVhe was alone when he finally died \u2014
p293
aVhis ultimate terror realized.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo as for that third sphere of play,
p296
aVwhich he never had learned to enjoy,
p297
aVI've learned over the years
p298
aVthat even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy \u2014
p299
aVenough so that a hobby, a sport, a love of music,
p300
aVor art, or literature, or any form of recreation,
p301
aVcan provide true pleasure, relaxation and replenishment.
p302
aVSo deep, for instance, was Abraham Lincoln's love of Shakespeare,
p303
aVthat he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theater,
p304
aVeven during those dark days of the war.
p305
aVHe said, when the lights went down and a Shakespeare play came on,
p306
aVfor a few precious hours he could imagine himself
p307
aVback in Prince Hal's time.
p308
aa(lp309
VBut an even more important form of relaxation for him,
p310
aVthat Lyndon Johnson never could enjoy,
p311
aVwas a love of \u2014 somehow \u2014 humor,
p312
aVand feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produce
p313
aVas a sidelight to the sadness.
p314
aVHe once said that he laughed so he did not cry,
p315
aVthat a good story, for him, was better than a drop of whiskey.
p316
aVHis storytelling powers had first been recognized
p317
aVwhen he was on the circuit in Illinois.
p318
aVThe lawyers and the judges would travel
p319
aVfrom one county courthouse to the other,
p320
aVand when anyone was knowing Lincoln was in town,
p321
aVthey would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories.
p322
aVHe would stand with his back against a fire
p323
aVand entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales.
p324
aVAnd all these stories became part of his memory bank,
p325
aVso he could call on them whenever he needed to.
p326
aVAnd they're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument.
p327
aa(lp328
VOne of his favorite stories, for example,
p329
aVhad to do with the Revolutionary War hero, Ethan Allen.
p330
aVAnd as Lincoln told the story,
p331
aVMr. Allen went to Britain after the war.
p332
aVAnd the British people were still upset
p333
aVabout losing the Revolution,
p334
aVso they decided to embarrass him a little bit
p335
aVby putting a huge picture of General Washington
p336
aVin the only outhouse, where he'd have to encounter it.
p337
aVThey figured he'd be upset about the indignity
p338
aVof George Washington being in an outhouse.
p339
aVBut he came out of the outhouse not upset at all.
p340
aVAnd so they said, "Well, did you see George Washington in there?"
p341
aV"Oh, yes," he said, "perfectly appropriate place for him."
p342
aV"What do you mean?" they said.
p343
aV"Well," he said, "there's nothing to make an Englishman shit
p344
aVfaster than the sight of General George Washington."
p345
aV(Laughter)
p346
aV(Applause)
p347
aa(lp348
VSo you can imagine, if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting \u2014
p349
aVand he had hundreds of these stories \u2014
p350
aVyou would have to relax.
p351
aVSo between his nightly treks to the theater,
p352
aVhis story telling, and his extraordinary sense of humor
p353
aVand his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry,
p354
aVhe found that form of play which carried him through his days.
p355
aVIn my own life, I shall always be grateful
p356
aVfor having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball.
p357
aVWhich allows me, from the beginning of spring training
p358
aVto the end of the fall,
p359
aVto have something to occupy my mind and heart
p360
aVother than my work.
p361
aa(lp362
VIt all began when I was only six years old,
p363
aVand my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score
p364
aVwhile listening to baseball games \u2014
p365
aVso that when he went to work in New York during the day,
p366
aVI could record for him the history of that afternoon's
p367
aVBrooklyn Dodgers game.
p368
aVNow, when you're only six years old,
p369
aVand your father comes home every single night
p370
aVand listens to you \u2014 as I now realize that I, in excruciating detail,
p371
aVrecounted every single play of every inning
p372
aVof the game that had just taken place that afternoon.
p373
aVBut he made me feel I was telling him a fabulous story.
p374
aVIt makes you think there's something magic about history
p375
aVto keep your father's attention.
p376
aa(lp377
VIn fact, I'm convinced I learned the narrative art
p378
aVfrom those nightly sessions with my father.
p379
aVBecause at first, I'd be so excited I would blurt out,
p380
aV"The Dodgers won!" or, "The Dodgers lost!"
p381
aVWhich took much of the drama of this two-hour telling away.
p382
aV(Laughter)
p383
aVSo I finally learned you had to tell a story
p384
aVfrom beginning to middle to end.
p385
aVI must say, so fervent was my love
p386
aVof the old Brooklyn Dodgers in those days
p387
aVthat I had to confess in my first confession
p388
aVtwo sins that related to baseball.
p389
aa(lp390
VThe first occurred because the Dodgers' catcher, Roy Campanella,
p391
aVcame to my hometown of Rockville Centre, Long Island,
p392
aVjust as I was in preparation for my first Holy Communion.
p393
aVAnd I was so excited \u2014
p394
aVfirst person I'd ever see outside of Ebbets Field.
p395
aVBut it so happened he was speaking in a Protestant Church.
p396
aVWhen you are brought up as a Catholic, you think
p397
aVthat if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church,
p398
aVyou'll be struck dead at the threshold.
p399
aVSo I went to my father in tears, "What are we going to do?"
p400
aVHe said, "Don't worry. He's speaking in a parish hall.
p401
aVWe're sitting in folding chairs. He's talking about sportsmanship.
p402
aVIt's not a sin."
p403
aVBut as I left that night, I was certain that somehow
p404
aVI'd traded the life of my everlasting soul
p405
aVfor this one night with Roy Campanella.
p406
aV(Laughter)
p407
aVAnd there were no indulgences around that I could buy.
p408
aVSo I had this sin on my soul when I went to my first confession.
p409
aVI told the priest right away.
p410
aVHe said, "No problem. It wasn't a religious service."
p411
aVBut then, unfortunately, he said, "And what else, my child?"
p412
aa(lp413
VAnd then came my second sin.
p414
aVI tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church,
p415
aVwishing harm to others, being mean to my sisters.
p416
aVAnd he said, "To whom did you wish harm?"
p417
aVAnd I had to say that I wished that various New York Yankees players
p418
aVwould break arms, legs and ankles \u2014
p419
aV(Laughter)
p420
aV\u2014 so that the Brooklyn Dodgers could win their first World Series.
p421
aVHe said, "How often do you make these horrible wishes?"
p422
aVAnd I had to say, every night when I said my prayers.

aV(Laughter)
p424
aVSo he said, "Look, I'll tell you something.
p425
aVI love the Brooklyn Dodgers, as you do,
p426
aVbut I promise you some day they will win fairly and squarely.
p427
aVYou do not need to wish harm on others to make it happen."
p428
aV"Oh yes," I said.
p429
aVBut luckily, my first confession \u2014 to a baseball-loving priest!
p430
aV(Laughter)
p431
aa(lp432
VWell, though my father died of a sudden heart attack
p433
aVwhen I was still in my 20s,
p434
aVbefore I had gotten married and had my three sons,
p435
aVI have passed his memory \u2014 as well as his love of baseball \u2014 on to my boys.
p436
aVThough when the Dodgers abandoned us to come to L.A.,
p437
aVI lost faith in baseball until I moved to Boston
p438
aVand became an irrational Red Socks fan.
p439
aVAnd I must say, even now, when I sit with my sons
p440
aVwith our season tickets,
p441
aVI can sometimes close my eyes against the sun
p442
aVand imagine myself, a young girl once more, in the presence of my father,
p443
aVwatching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below:
p444
aVJackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Pee Wee Reese, and Duke Snider.
p445
aa(lp446
VI must say there is magic in these moments.
p447
aVWhen I open my eyes and I see my sons
p448
aVin the place where my father once sat,
p449
aVI feel an invisible loyalty and love
p450
aVlinking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see,
p451
aVbut whose heart and soul they have come to know
p452
aVthrough all the stories I have told.
p453
aVWhich is why, in the end, I shall always be grateful for this curious love of history,
p454
aVallowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past.
p455
aVAllowing me to learn from these large figures
p456
aVabout the struggle for meaning for life.
p457
aVAllowing me to believe that the private people
p458
aVwe have loved and lost in our families,
p459
aVand the public figures we have respected in our history,
p460
aVjust as Abraham Lincoln wanted to believe,
p461
aVreally can live on, so long as we pledge
p462
aVto tell and to retell the stories of their lives.
p463
aVThank you for letting me be that storyteller today.
p464
aV(Applause)
p465
aVThank you.

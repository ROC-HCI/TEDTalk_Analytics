VI'm a contemporary artist and I show in art galleries and museums.
p5
aVI show a number of photographs and films,
p6
aVbut I also make television programs, books and some advertising,
p7
aVall with the same concept.
p8
aVAnd it's about our fixation with celebrity and celebrity culture,
p9
aVand the importance of the image:
p10
aVcelebrity is born of photography.
p11
aa(lp12
VI'm going to start with how I started with this concept seven years ago,
p13
aVwhen Princess Diana died.
p14
aVThere was a sort of a standstill in Britain
p15
aVthe moment of her death,
p16
aVand people decided to mourn her death in a sort of mass way.
p17
aVI was fascinated by this phenomenon,
p18
aVso I wondered:
p19
aVcould one erase the image of Diana, actually quite crudely and physically?
p20
aVSo, I got a gun and started to shoot at the image of Diana,
p21
aVbut I couldn't erase this from my memory
p22
aVand certainly it was not being erased from the public psyche.
p23
aVMomentum was being built.
p24
aVThe press wrote about her death in rather, I felt, pornographic ways \u2014
p25
aVlike, "Which bit of artery left which bit of body?"
p26
aVand "How did she die in the back of the car?" \u2014
p27
aVand I was intrigued by this sort of mass voyeurism,
p28
aVso I made these rather gory images.
p29
aa(lp30
VI then went on wondering whether I could actually replace her image,
p31
aVso I got a look-alike of Diana
p32
aVand posed her in the right positions and angles
p33
aVand created something that was in, or existed in, the public imagination.
p34
aVSo people were wondering: was she going to marry Dodi?
p35
aVWas she in love with him?
p36
aVWas she pregnant? Did she want his baby?
p37
aVWas she pregnant when she died?
p38
aVSo I created this image of Diana, Dodi and their imaginary mixed-race child
p39
aVand this image came out, which caused a huge public outcry at the time.
p40
aa(lp41
VI then went on to make more comments on the media and press imagery,
p42
aVso I started making reference to media imagery \u2014
p43
aVmade it grainy, shot through doorways and so on and so forth \u2014
p44
aVto titillate the public or the viewer further
p45
aVin terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism.
p46
aVSo, this is an image of Diana looking at Camilla kissing her husband,
p47
aVand this was a sequence of images.
p48
aVAnd this gets shown in art galleries like this, as a sequence.
p49
aVAnd similarly with the Di-Dodian baby imagery \u2014
p50
aVthis is another art gallery installation.
p51
aa(lp52
VI'm particularly interested in how you can't rely on your own perception.
p53
aVThis is Jane Smith and Jo Bloggs, for instance,
p54
aVbut you think it's Camilla and the Queen,
p55
aVand I'm fascinated how what you think is real isn't necessarily real.
p56
aVAnd the camera can lie,
p57
aVand it makes it very, very easy
p58
aVwith the mass bombardment of imagery to tell untruths.
p59
aVSo, I continued to work on this project of how photography seduces us
p60
aVand is more interesting to look at than the actual real subject matter.
p61
aVAnd at the same time, it removes us from the real subject matter,
p62
aa(lp63
Vand this acts as a sort of titillating thing.
p64
aVSo, the photograph becomes this teaser and incites desire and voyeurism;
p65
aVwhat you can't have, you want more.
p66
aVIn the photograph, the real subject doesn't exist
p67
aVso it makes you want that person more.
p68
aVAnd that is the way, I think, that celebrity magazines work now:
p69
aVthe more pictures you see of these celebrities,
p70
aVthe more you feel you know them,
p71
aVbut you don't know them
p72
aVand you want to know them further.
p73
aa(lp74
VOf course, the Queen goes to her stud often to watch her horses ...
p75
aVwatch her horses. (Laughter).
p76
aVAnd then I was sort of making imagery.
p77
aVIn England there's an expression: "you can't imagine the Queen on the loo."
p78
aVSo I'm trying to penetrate that.
p79
aVWell, here is the image.
p80
aa(lp81
VAll this imagery was creating a lot of fuss
p82
aVand I was cited as a disgusting artist. The press were writing about this,
p83
aVgiving full pages about how terrible this was.
p84
aVWhich I found very interesting that it was going full cycle:
p85
aVI was making comments about the press
p86
aVand about how we know facts and information only by media \u2014
p87
aVbecause we don't know the real people;
p88
aVvery few of us know the real people \u2014
p89
aVbut it was going back into the press
p90
aVand they were publicizing, effectively, my filthy work.
p91
aVSo, these are broadsheets, tabloids, debates were being had all about this work,
p92
aVfilms were being banned before people had actually had the look at the work,
p93
aVpoliticians were getting involved \u2014
p94
aVall sorts of things \u2014 great headlines.
p95
aa(lp96
VThen suddenly, it started to get on front pages.
p97
aVI was being asked and paid to do front covers.
p98
aVSuddenly I was becoming sort of acceptable,
p99
aVwhich I found also fascinating.
p100
aVHow one moment \u2014 it was disgusting \u2014
p101
aVjournalists would lie to me to get a story or a photograph of me,
p102
aVsaying my work was wonderful,
p103
aVand the next minute there were terrible headlines about me.
p104
aVBut then this changed suddenly.
p105
aa(lp106
VI then started to work for magazines and newspapers.
p107
aVThis was, for example, an image that went into Tatler.
p108
aVThis was another newspaper image.
p109
aVIt was an April fool actually, and to this day some people think it's real.
p110
aVI was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day,
p111
aVand they were saying there's this great image of the Queen
p112
aVsitting outside William Hill.
p113
aVThey thought it was real.
p114
aa(lp115
VI was exploring, at the time, the hyperbole of icons \u2014
p116
aVand Diana and Marilyn \u2014 and the importance of celebrity in our lives.
p117
aVHow they wheedle their way into the collective psyche
p118
aVwithout us even knowing,
p119
aVand how that should happen.
p120
aVI explored with actually dressing up as the celebrities myself.
p121
aVThere's me as Diana \u2014
p122
aVI look like the mass murderer Myra Hindley, I think, in this one. (Laughter).
p123
aVAnd me as the Queen.
p124
aVI then continued on to make a whole body of work about Marilyn \u2014
p125
aVthe biggest icon of all \u2014
p126
aVand trying to titillate by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so forth,
p127
aVand only showing certain angles to create a reality that, obviously,
p128
aVis completely constructed.
p129
aVThis is the look-alike, so the crafting elements of this is completely enormous.
p130
aVShe looks nothing like Marilyn,
p131
aVbut by the time we've made her up and put wigs and makeup on,
p132
aVshe looks exactly like Marilyn,
p133
aVto the extent that her husband couldn't recognize her \u2014
p134
aVor recognize this look-alike \u2014 in these photographs,
p135
aVwhich I find quite interesting.
p136
aVSo, all this work is getting shown in art galleries.
p137
aVThen I made a book.
p138
aVI was also making a TV series for the BBC at the time.
p139
aVStills from the TV series went into this book.
p140
aa(lp141
VBut there was a real legal problem because it looks real,
p142
aVbut how do you get over that?
p143
aVBecause obviously it's making a comment about our culture right now:
p144
aVthat we can't tell what's real.
p145
aVHow do we know when we're looking at something whether it's real or not?
p146
aVSo, from my point of view, it's important to publish it,
p147
aVbut at the same time it does cause a confusion \u2014
p148
aVintentional on my behalf,
p149
aVbut problematic for any outlet that I'm working with.
p150
aVSo a big disclaimer is put on everything that I do,
p151
aVand I made narratives about all the European or Brit celebrities
p152
aVand comments about our public figures.
p153
aVYou know, what does Tony Blair get up to in private with his fashion guru?
p154
aVAnd also dealing with the perceptions that are put about
p155
aVBin Laden, Saddam Hussein, the links that were put about pre-Iraq war.
p156
aVAnd what is going to happen to the monarchy?
p157
aVBecause obviously the British public,
p158
aVI think, would prefer William to Charles on the throne.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd it's that wish, or that desire, that I suppose I'm dealing with in my work.
p161
aVI'm not really interested in the celebrity themselves.
p162
aVI'm interested in the perception of the celebrity.
p163
aVAnd with some look-alikes, they are so good
p164
aVyou don't know whether they're real or not.
p165
aa(lp166
VI did an advertising campaign for Schweppes, which is Coca-Cola,
p167
aVand so that was very interesting in terms of the legalities.
p168
aVIt's highly commercial.
p169
aVBut it was a difficulty for me \u2014 because this is my artwork;
p170
aVshould I do advertising? \u2014 at the time.
p171
aVSo I made sure the work was not compromised in any way
p172
aVand that the integrity of the work remained the same.
p173
aVBut the meanings changed in the sense that with the logo on,
p174
aVyou're closing all the lines of interpretation down to selling a product
p175
aVand that's all you're doing.
p176
aVWhen you take the logo off, you're opening up the interpretations
p177
aVand making the work inconclusive,
p178
aVopposed to conclusive when you are advertising.
p179
aa(lp180
VThis image is quite interesting, actually,
p181
aVbecause I think we made it three years ago.
p182
aVAnd it's Camilla in her wedding dress, which, again,
p183
aVnearly got re-used now, recently prior to her wedding.
p184
aVTony Blair and Cherie. And again, the legalities \u2014 we had to be very careful.
p185
aVIt's obviously a very big commercial company, and so this little,
p186
aV"Shh \u2014 it's not really them,"
p187
aVwas put on the side of the imagery.
p188
aVAnd Margaret Thatcher visiting Jeffery Archer in jail.
p189
aa(lp190
VI then was asked by Selfridges to do a series of windows for them,
p191
aVso I built a sauna bath in one of their windows and created little scenes \u2014
p192
aVlive scenes with look-alikes inside the windows,
p193
aVand the windows were all steamed up.
p194
aVSo, it's Tony Blair reading and practicing his speech;
p195
aVI've got them doing yoga inside there with Carole Caplin;
p196
aVSven making out with Ulrika Jonsson, who he was having an affair with at that time.
p197
aVThis was a huge success for them
p198
aVbecause the imagery got shown in the press the day after
p199
aVin every single newspaper, broadsheets and tabloids.
p200
aVIt was a bit of a road stopper, which was problematic
p201
aVbecause the police kept on trying to clear away the crowds,
p202
aVbut huge fun \u2014 it was great for me to do a performance.
p203
aVAlso, people were taking photographs of this,
p204
aVso it was being texted around the world extremely quickly, all this imagery.
p205
aVAnd the press were interviewing, and I was signing my book. (Laughter).
p206
aa(lp207
VFurther imagery. I'm making a new book now with Taschen
p208
aVthat I'm working on really for a sort of global market \u2014
p209
aVmy previous book was only for the U.K. market \u2014
p210
aVthat I suppose it could be called humorous.
p211
aVI suppose I come from a sort of non-humorous background
p212
aVwith serious intent,
p213
aVand then suddenly my work is funny.
p214
aVAnd I think it doesn't really matter that my work is considered humorous, in a way;
p215
aVI think it's a way in for me to deal with the importance of imagery
p216
aVand how we read all our information through imagery.
p217
aVIt's an extremely fast way of getting information.
p218
aVIt's extremely difficult if it's constructed correctly,
p219
aVand there are techniques of constructing iconic imagery.
p220
aa(lp221
VThis image, for example, is sort of spot-on
p222
aVbecause it exactly sums up what Elton may be doing in private,
p223
aVand also what might be happening with Saddam Hussein, and George Bush
p224
aVreading the Koran upside-down.
p225
aVFor example, George Bush target practice \u2014
p226
aVshooting at Bin Laden and Michael Moore.
p227
aVAnd then you change the photograph he's shooting at,
p228
aVand it suddenly becomes rather grim and maybe less accessible. (Laughter).
p229
aVTony Blair being used as a mounting block,
p230
aVand Rumsfeld and Bush laughing with some Abu Ghraib photos behind,
p231
aVand the seriousness, or the intellect, of Bush.
p232
aVAnd also, commenting on the behind the scenes \u2014
p233
aVwell, as we know now \u2014 what goes on in prisons.
p234
aVAnd in fact, George Bush and Tony Blair
p235
aVare having great fun during all of this.
p236
aa(lp237
VAnd really commenting, you know,
p238
aVbased on the perception we have of the celebrities.
p239
aVWhat Jack Nicholson might be up to in his celebrity life,
p240
aVand the fact that he tried to ... he had a bit of road rage
p241
aVand golf-clubbed a driver the other day.
p242
aVI mean, it's extremely difficult to find these look-alikes,
p243
aVso I'm constantly going up to people in the street
p244
aVand trying to ask people to come
p245
aVand be in one of my photographs or films.
p246
aVAnd sometimes asking the real celebrity,
p247
aVmistaking them for someone who just looks like the real person,
p248
aVwhich is highly embarrassing. (Laughter).
p249
aa(lp250
VI've also been working with The Guardian on a topical basis \u2014
p251
aVa page a week in their newspaper \u2014
p252
aVwhich has been very interesting, working topically.
p253
aVSo, Jamie Oliver and school dinners;
p254
aVBush and Blair having difficulty getting alongside Muslim culture;
p255
aVthe whole of the hunting issue,
p256
aVand the royal family refusing to stop hunting;
p257
aVand the tsunami issues; and obviously Harry;
p258
aVBlair's views on Gordon Brown, which I find very interesting;
p259
aVCondi and Bush.
p260
aVThis image I've decided to show having a reservation about it.
p261
aVI made it a year ago. And just how meanings change,
p262
aVand there were a terrible thing that has happened,
p263
aVbut the fear is lurking around in our minds prior to that.
p264
aVThat's why this image was made one year ago,
p265
aVand what it means today.
p266
aVSo, I'll leave you with these clips to have a look. (Music)
p267
aa(lp268
VChris Anderson: Thank you.

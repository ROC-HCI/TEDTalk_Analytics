VHas anyone among you ever been exposed to tear gas?
p5
aVTear gas? Anyone?
p6
aVI'm sorry to hear that, so you might know that it's a very toxic substance,
p7
aVbut you might not know that it's a very simple molecule
p8
aVwith an unpronouncable name:
p9
aVit's called chlorobenzalmalononitrile.
p10
aVI made it.
p11
aVIt's decades old, but it's becoming very trendy among police forces
p12
aVaround the planet lately, it seems,
p13
aVand according to my experience as a non-voluntary breather of it,
p14
aVtear gas has two main but quite opposite effects.
p15
aVOne, it can really burn your eyes,
p16
aVand two, it can also help you to open them.
p17
aa(lp18
VTear gas definitely helped to open mine to something
p19
aVthat I want to share with you this afternoon:
p20
aVthat livestreaming the power of independent broadcasts through the web
p21
aVcan be a game-changer in journalism,
p22
aVin activism, and as I see it, in the political discourse as well.
p23
aa(lp24
VThat idea started  to dawn on me in early 2011
p25
aVwhen I was covering a protest in São Paulo.
p26
aVIt was the marijuana march,
p27
aVa gathering of people asking for the legalization of cannabis.
p28
aVWhen that group started to move,
p29
aVthe riot police came from the back with rubber bullets, bombs,
p30
aVand then the gas.
p31
aVBut to make a long story short,
p32
aVI had entered that protest as the editor-in-chief
p33
aVof a well-established printed magazine where I'd worked for 11 years,
p34
aVand thanks to this unsolicited effects of tear gas,
p35
aVI left it as a journalist that was now committed to new ways
p36
aVof sharing the raw experience of what it's like to be there, actually.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo in the following week, I was back in the streets,
p39
aVbut that time, I wasn't a member of any media outlet anymore.
p40
aVI was there as an independent livestreamer, and all I had with me
p41
aVwas basically borrowed equipment.
p42
aVI had a very simple camera and a backpack with 3G modems.
p43
aVAnd I had this weblink that could be shared through social media,
p44
aVcould be put in any website,
p45
aVand that time, the protest went along fine.
p46
aVThere was no violence.
p47
aVThere was no action scenes.
p48
aVBut there was something really exciting,
p49
aVbecause I could see at a distance the TV channels covering it,
p50
aVand they had these big vans and the teams and the cameras,
p51
aVand I was basically doing the same thing
p52
aVand all I had was a backpack.
p53
aVAnd that was really exciting to a journalist,
p54
aVbut the most interesting part was when I got back home, actually,
p55
aVbecause I learned that I had been watched
p56
aVby more than 90,000 people,
p57
aVand I got hundreds of emails and messages of people asking me, basically,
p58
aVhow did I do it,
p59
aVhow it was possible to do such a thing.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd I learned something else, that that was actually the first time
p62
aVthat somebody had ever done a livestreaming in a street protest
p63
aVin the country.
p64
aVAnd that really shocked me,
p65
aVbecause I was no geek, I was no technology guy,
p66
aVand all the equipment needed was already there,
p67
aVwas easily available.
p68
aVAnd I realized that we had a frontier here,
p69
aVa very important one,
p70
aVthat it was just a matter of changing the perspective,
p71
aVand the web could be actually used,
p72
aValready used, as a colossal and uncontrollable
p73
aVand highly anarchical TV channel, TV network,
p74
aVand anyone with very basic skills and very basic equipment,
p75
aVeven someone like me who had this little stuttering issue,
p76
aVso if it happens, bear with me please,
p77
aVeven someone like me could become a broadcaster.
p78
aVAnd that sounded revolutionary in my mind.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo for the next couple of years,
p81
aVI started to experiment with livestreaming in different ways,
p82
aVnot only in the streets but mostly in studios and in homes,
p83
aVuntil the beginning of 2013, last year,
p84
aVwhen I became the cofounder of a group called Mídia NINJA.
p85
aVNINJA is an acronym
p86
aVthat stands for Narrativas Independentes  Jornalismo e Ação,
p87
aVor in English, independent narratives, journalism, and action.
p88
aVIt was a media group that had little media plan.
p89
aVWe didn't have any financial structure.
p90
aVWe were not planning to make money out of this,
p91
aVwhich was wise, because you shouldn't try to make money out of journalism now.
p92
aVBut we had a very solid and clear conviction,
p93
aVthat we knew that the hyperconnected environment of social media
p94
aVcould maybe allow us to consolidate
p95
aVa network of experimental journalists throughout the country.
p96
aVSo we launched a Facebook page first, and then a manifesto,
p97
aVand started to cover the streets in a very simple way.
p98
aa(lp99
VBut then something happened, something that wasn't predicted,
p100
aVthat no one could have anticipated.
p101
aVStreet protests started to erupt in São Paulo.
p102
aVThey began as very local and specific.
p103
aVThey were against the bus fare hike that had just happened in the city.
p104
aVThis is a bus.
p105
aVIt's written there, "Theft."
p106
aVBut those kind of manifestations started to grow,
p107
aVand they kept happening.
p108
aVSo the police violence against them started to grow as well.
p109
aVBut there was another conflict,
p110
aVthe one I believe that's more important here
p111
aVto make my point that it was a narrative conflict.
p112
aVThere was this mainstream media version of the facts
p113
aVthat anyone who was on the streets could easily challenge
p114
aVif they presented their own vision of what was actually happening there.
p115
aVAnd it was this clash of visions, this clash of narratives,
p116
aVthat I think turned those protests
p117
aVinto a long period in the country of political reckoning
p118
aVwhere hundreds of thousands of people,
p119
aVprobably more than a million people
p120
aVtook to the streets in the whole country.
p121
aa(lp122
VBut it wasn't about the bus fare hike anymore.
p123
aVIt was about everything.
p124
aVThe people's demands, their expectations,
p125
aVthe reasons why they were on the streets
p126
aVcould be as diverse as they could be contradictory in many cases.
p127
aVIf you could read it, you would understand me.
p128
aVBut it was in this environment of political catharsis
p129
aVthat the country was going through
p130
aVthat it had to do with politics, indeed,
p131
aVbut it had to do also with a new way of organizing,
p132
aVthrough a new way of communicating.
p133
aVIt was in that environment that Mídia NINJA emerged
p134
aVfrom almost anonymity to become a national phenomenon,
p135
aVbecause we did have the right equipment.
p136
aVWe are not using big cameras.
p137
aVWe are using basically this.
p138
aVWe are using smartphones.
p139
aVAnd that, actually, allowed us to become invisible in the middle of the protests,
p140
aVbut it allowed us to do something else:
p141
aVto show what it was like to be in the protests,
p142
aVto present to people at home a subjective perspective.
p143
aa(lp144
VBut there was something that is more important,
p145
aVI think, than the equipment.
p146
aVIt was our mindset,
p147
aVbecause we are not behaving as a media outlet.
p148
aVWe are not competing for news.
p149
aVWe are trying to encourage people,
p150
aVto invite people, and to actually teach people
p151
aVhow to do this, how they also could become broadcasters.
p152
aVAnd that was crucial to turn Mídia NINJA from a small group of people,
p153
aVand in a matter of weeks,
p154
aVwe multiplied and we grew exponentially throughout the country.
p155
aVSo in a matter of a week or two, as the protests kept happening,
p156
aVwe were hundreds of young people
p157
aVconnected in this network throughout the country.
p158
aVWe were covering more than 50 cities at the same time.
p159
aVThat's something that no TV channel could ever do.
p160
aVThat was responsible for turning us suddenly, actually,
p161
aVinto kind of the mainstream media of social media.
p162
aVSo we had a couple of thousands of followers on our Facebook page,
p163
aVand soon we had a quarter of a million followers.
p164
aVOur posts and our videos
p165
aVwere being seen by more than 11 million timelines a week.
p166
aVIt was way more than any newspaper or any magazine could ever do.
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd that turned Mídia NINJA into something else,
p169
aVmore than a media outlet, than a media project.
p170
aVIt became almost like a public service
p171
aVto the citizen, to the protester,
p172
aVto the activist,
p173
aVbecause they had a very simple and efficient and peaceful tool
p174
aVto confront both police and media authority.
p175
aVMany of our images started  to be used in regular TV channels.
p176
aVOur livestreams started to be broadcast even in regular televisions
p177
aVwhen things got really rough.
p178
aVSome our images were responsible to take some people out of jail,
p179
aVpeople who were being arrested unfairly
p180
aVunder false accusations, and we could prove them innocent.
p181
aVAnd that also turned Mídia NINJA very soon
p182
aVto be seen as almost an enemy of cops, unfortunately,
p183
aVand we started to be severely beaten, and eventually arrested on the streets.
p184
aVIt happened in many cases.
p185
aVBut that was also useful, because we were still at the web,
p186
aVso that helped to trigger an important debate in the country
p187
aVon the role of the media itself
p188
aVand the state of the freedom of the press in the country.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo Mídia NINJA now evolved
p191
aVand finally consolidated itself in what we hoped it would become:
p192
aVa national network of hundreds of young people,
p193
aVself-organizing themselves locally
p194
aVto cover social, human rights issues,
p195
aVand expressing themselves not only politically
p196
aVbut journalistically.
p197
aa(lp198
VWhat I started to do in the beginning of this year,
p199
aVas Mídia NINJA is already a self-organizing network,
p200
aVI'm dedicating myself to another project.
p201
aVIt's called Fluxo, which is Portuguese for "stream."
p202
aVIt's a journalism studio in São Paulo downtown,
p203
aVwhere I used livestream to experiment
p204
aVwith what I call post-television formats.
p205
aVBut I'm also trying to come up with ways to finance independent journalism
p206
aVthrough a direct relationship with an audience,
p207
aVwith an active audience,
p208
aVbecause now I really want to try to make a living
p209
aVout of my tear gas resolution back then.
p210
aa(lp211
VBut there's something more significant here,
p212
aVsomething that I believe is more important and more crucial than my personal example.
p213
aVI said that livestream could turn the web into a colossal TV network,
p214
aVbut I believe it does something else,
p215
aVbecause after watching people using it,
p216
aVnot only to cover things but to express, to organize themselves politically,
p217
aVI believe livestream can turn cyberspace into a global political arena
p218
aVwhere everyone might have a voice,
p219
aVa proper voice,
p220
aVbecause livestream takes the monopoly of the broadcast political discourse,
p221
aVof the verbal aspect of the political dialogue
p222
aVout of the mouths of just politicians and political pundits alone,
p223
aVand it empowers the citizen through this direct and non-mediated power
p224
aVof exchanging experiences and dialogue,
p225
aVempowers them to question and to influence authorities
p226
aVin ways in which we are about to see.
p227
aa(lp228
VAnd I believe it does something else that might be even more important,
p229
aVthat the simplicity of the technology can merge objectivity and subjectivity
p230
aVin a very political way, as I see it,
p231
aVbecause it really helps the audience,
p232
aVthe citizen, to see the world through somebody else's eye,
p233
aVso it helps the citizen to put him- or herself
p234
aVin other people's place.
p235
aVAnd that idea, I think,  should be the intention,
p236
aVshould be the goal of any good journalism, any good activism,
p237
aVbut most of all, any good politics.
p238
aa(lp239
VThank you very much. It was an honor.

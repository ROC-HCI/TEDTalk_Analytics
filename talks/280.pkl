VWelcome. If I could have the first slide, please?
p5
aVContrary to calculations made by some engineers, bees can fly,
p6
aVdolphins can swim, and geckos can even climb
p7
aVup the smoothest surfaces. Now, what I want to do, in the short time I have,
p8
aVis to try to allow each of you to experience
p9
aVthe thrill of revealing nature's design.
p10
aVI get to do this all the time, and it's just incredible.
p11
aVI want to try to share just a little bit of that with you in this presentation.
p12
aVThe challenge of looking at nature's designs \u2014
p13
aVand I'll tell you the way that we perceive it, and the way we've used it.
p14
aVThe challenge, of course, is to answer this question:
p15
aVwhat permits this extraordinary performance of animals
p16
aVthat allows them basically to go anywhere?
p17
aVAnd if we could figure that out, how can we implement those designs?
p18
aa(lp19
VWell, many biologists will tell engineers, and others,
p20
aVorganisms have millions of years to get it right;
p21
aVthey're spectacular; they can do everything wonderfully well.
p22
aVSo, the answer is bio-mimicry: just copy nature directly.
p23
aVWe know from working on animals that the truth is
p24
aVthat's exactly what you don't want to do \u2014 because evolution works
p25
aVon the just-good-enough principle, not on a perfecting principle.
p26
aVAnd the constraints in building any organism, when you look at it,
p27
aVare really severe. Natural technologies have incredible constraints.
p28
aVThink about it. If you were an engineer and I told you
p29
aVthat you had to build an automobile, but it had to start off to be this big,
p30
aVthen it had to grow to be full size and had to work every step along the way.
p31
aVOr think about the fact that if you build an automobile, I'll tell you that you also \u2014 inside it \u2014
p32
aVhave to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VAnd you can absolutely never, absolutely never, because of history
p37
aVand the inherited plan, start with a clean slate.
p38
aVSo, organisms have this important history.
p39
aVReally evolution works more like a tinkerer than an engineer.
p40
aVAnd this is really important when you begin to look at animals.
p41
aVInstead, we believe you need to be inspired by biology.
p42
aVYou need to discover the general principles of nature,
p43
aVand then use these analogies when they're advantageous.
p44
aVThis is a real challenge to do this, because animals,
p45
aVwhen you start to really look inside them \u2014 how they work \u2014
p46
aVappear hopelessly complex. There's no detailed history
p47
aVof the design plans, you can't go look it up anywhere.
p48
aVThey have way too many motions for their joints, too many muscles.
p49
aVEven the simplest animal we think of, something like an insect,
p50
aVand they have more neurons and connections than you can imagine.
p51
aa(lp52
VHow can you make sense of this? Well, we believed \u2014
p53
aVand we hypothesized \u2014 that one way animals could work simply,
p54
aVis if the control of their movements
p55
aVtended to be built into their bodies themselves.
p56
aVWhat we discovered was that two-, four-, six- and eight-legged animals
p57
aVall produce the same forces on the ground when they move.
p58
aVThey all work like this kangaroo, they bounce.
p59
aVAnd they can be modeled by a spring-mass system that we call the spring mass system
p60
aVbecause we're biomechanists. It's actually a pogo stick.
p61
aVThey all produce the pattern of a pogo stick. How is that true?
p62
aVWell, a human, one of your legs works like two legs of a trotting dog,
p63
aVor works like three legs, together as one, of a trotting insect,
p64
aVor four legs as one of a trotting crab.
p65
aVAnd then they alternate in their propulsion,
p66
aVbut the patterns are all the same. Almost every organism we've looked at this way
p67
aV\u2014 you'll see next week, I'll give you a hint,
p68
aVthere'll be an article coming out that says that really big things
p69
aVlike T. rex probably couldn't do this, but you'll see that next week.
p70
aa(lp71
VNow, what's interesting is the animals, then \u2014 we said \u2014 bounce along
p72
aVthe vertical plane this way, and in our collaborations with Pixar,
p73
aVin "A Bug's Life," we discussed the
p74
aVbipedal nature of the characters of the ants.
p75
aVAnd we told them, of course, they move in another plane as well.
p76
aVAnd they asked us this question. They say, "Why model
p77
aVjust in the sagittal plane or the vertical plane,
p78
aVwhen you're telling us these animals are moving
p79
aVin the horizontal plane?" This is a good question.
p80
aVNobody in biology ever modeled it this way.
p81
aVWe took their advice and we modeled the animals moving
p82
aVin the horizontal plane as well. We took their three legs,
p83
aVwe collapsed them down as one.
p84
aVWe got some of the best mathematicians in the world
p85
aVfrom Princeton to work on this problem.
p86
aVAnd we were able to create a model
p87
aVwhere animals are not only bouncing up and down,
p88
aVbut they're also bouncing side to side at the same time.
p89
aVAnd many organisms fit this kind of pattern.
p90
aVNow, why is this important to have this model?
p91
aVBecause it's very interesting. When you take this model
p92
aVand you perturb it, you give it a push,
p93
aVas it bumps into something, it self-stabilizes, with no brain
p94
aVor no reflexes, just by the structure alone.
p95
aVIt's a beautiful model. Let's look at the mathematics.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VThat's enough!
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VThe animals, when you look at them running,
p104
aVappear to be self-stabilizing like this,
p105
aVusing basically springy legs. That is, the legs can do
p106
aVcomputations on their own; the control algorithms, in a sense,
p107
aVare embedded in the form of the animal itself.
p108
aVWhy haven't we been more inspired by nature and these kinds of discoveries?
p109
aVWell, I would argue that human technologies are really different from
p110
aVnatural technologies, at least they have been so far.
p111
aVThink about the typical kind of robot that you see.
p112
aVHuman technologies have tended to be large, flat,
p113
aVwith right angles, stiff, made of metal. They have rolling devices
p114
aVand axles. There are very few motors, very few sensors.
p115
aVWhereas nature tends to be small, and curved,
p116
aVand it bends and twists, and has legs instead, and appendages,
p117
aVand has many muscles and many, many sensors.
p118
aVSo it's a very different design. However, what's changing,
p119
aVwhat's really exciting \u2014 and I'll show you some of that next \u2014
p120
aVis that as human technology takes on more of the characteristics
p121
aVof nature, then nature really can become a much more useful teacher.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd here's one example that's really exciting.
p124
aVThis is a collaboration we have with Stanford.
p125
aVAnd they developed this new technique, called Shape Deposition Manufacturing.
p126
aVIt's a technique where they can mix materials together and mold any shape
p127
aVthat they like, and put in the material properties.
p128
aVThey can embed sensors and actuators right in the form itself.
p129
aVFor example, here's a leg: the clear part is stiff,
p130
aVthe white part is compliant, and you don't need any axles there or anything.
p131
aVIt just bends by itself beautifully.
p132
aVSo, you can put those properties in. It inspired them to show off
p133
aVthis design by producing a little robot they named Sprawl.
p134
aVOur work has also inspired another robot, a biologically inspired bouncing robot,
p135
aVfrom the University of Michigan and McGill
p136
aVnamed RHex, for robot hexapod, and this one's autonomous.
p137
aVLet's go to the video, and let me show you some of these animals moving
p138
aVand then some of the simple robots
p139
aVthat have been inspired by our discoveries.
p140
aVHere's what some of you did this morning, although you did it outside,
p141
aVnot on a treadmill.
p142
aVHere's what we do.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VThis is a death's head cockroach. This is an American cockroach
p147
aVyou think you don't have in your kitchen.
p148
aVThis is an eight-legged scorpion, six-legged ant, forty-four-legged centipede.
p149
aVNow, I said all these animals are sort of working like pogo sticks \u2014
p150
aVthey're bouncing along as they move. And you can see that
p151
aVin this ghost crab, from the beaches of Panama and North Carolina.
p152
aVIt goes up to four meters per second when it runs.
p153
aVIt actually leaps into the air, and has aerial phases
p154
aVwhen it does it, like a horse, and you'll see it's bouncing here.
p155
aVWhat we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human
p156
aVlike Richard, or a cockroach, or a crab, or a kangaroo,
p157
aVthe relative leg stiffness of that spring is the same for everything we've seen so far.
p158
aVNow, what good are springy legs then? What can they do?
p159
aVWell, we wanted to see if they allowed the animals
p160
aVto have greater stability and maneuverability.
p161
aVSo, we built a terrain that had obstacles three times the hip height
p162
aVof the animals that we're looking at.
p163
aVAnd we were certain they couldn't do this. And here's what they did.
p164
aVThe animal ran over it and it didn't even slow down!
p165
aVIt didn't decrease its preferred speed at all.
p166
aVWe couldn't believe that it could do this. It said to us
p167
aVthat if you could build a robot with very simple, springy legs,
p168
aVyou could make it as maneuverable as any that's ever been built.
p169
aa(lp170
VHere's the first example of that. This is the Stanford
p171
aVShape Deposition Manufactured robot, named Sprawl.
p172
aVIt has six legs \u2014 there are the tuned, springy legs.
p173
aVIt moves in a gait that an insect uses, and here it is
p174
aVgoing on the treadmill. Now, what's important about this robot,
p175
aVcompared to other robots, is that it can't see anything,
p176
aVit can't feel anything, it doesn't have a brain, yet it can maneuver
p177
aVover these obstacles without any difficulty whatsoever.
p178
aVIt's this technique of building the properties into the form.
p179
aVThis is a graduate student. This is what he's doing to his thesis project \u2014
p180
aVvery robust, if a graduate student
p181
aVdoes that to his thesis project.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VThis is from McGill and University of Michigan. This is the RHex,
p186
aVmaking its first outing in a demo.
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
VSame principle: it only has six moving parts,
p191
aVsix motors, but it has springy, tuned legs. It moves in the gait of the insect.
p192
aVIt has the middle leg moving in synchrony with the front,
p193
aVand the hind leg on the other side. Sort of an alternating tripod,
p194
aVand they can negotiate obstacles just like the animal.
p195
aa(lp196
V(Laughter)
p197
aa(lp198
V(Voice: Oh my God.)
p199
aa(lp200
V(Applause)
p201
aa(lp202
VRobert Full: It'll go on different surfaces \u2014 here's sand \u2014
p203
aValthough we haven't perfected the feet yet, but I'll talk about that later.
p204
aVHere's RHex entering the woods.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Laughter)
p207
aa(lp208
VAgain, this robot can't see anything, it can't feel anything,
p209
aVit has no brain. It's just working with a tuned mechanical system,
p210
aVwith very simple parts, but inspired from the fundamental dynamics of the animal.
p211
aV(Voice: Ah, I love him, Bob.) RF: Here's it going down a pathway.
p212
aVI presented this to the jet propulsion lab at NASA, and they said
p213
aVthat they had no ability to go down craters to look for ice,
p214
aVand life, ultimately, on Mars. And he said \u2014
p215
aVespecially with legged-robots, because they're way too complicated.
p216
aVNothing can do that. And I talk next. I showed them this video
p217
aVwith the simple design of RHex here. And just to convince them
p218
aVwe should go to Mars in 2011, I tinted the video orange
p219
aVjust to give them the sense of being on Mars.
p220
aa(lp221
V(Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
V(Applause)
p224
aa(lp225
VAnother reason why animals have extraordinary performance,
p226
aVand can go anywhere, is because they have an effective interaction
p227
aVwith the environment. The animal I'm going to show you,
p228
aVthat we studied to look at this, is the gecko.
p229
aVWe have one here and notice its position. It's holding on.
p230
aVNow I'm going to challenge you. I'm going show you a video.
p231
aVOne of the animals is going to be running on the level,
p232
aVand the other one's going to be running up a wall. Which one's which?
p233
aVThey're going at a meter a second. How many think the one on the left
p234
aVis running up the wall?
p235
aa(lp236
V(Applause)
p237
aa(lp238
VOkay. The point is it's really hard to tell, isn't it? It's incredible,
p239
aVwe looked at students do this and they couldn't tell.
p240
aVThey can run up a wall at a meter a second, 15 steps per second,
p241
aVand they look like they're running on the level. How do they do this?
p242
aVIt's just phenomenal. The one on the right was going up the hill.
p243
aVHow do they do this? They have bizarre toes. They have toes
p244
aVthat uncurl like party favors when you blow them out,
p245
aVand then peel off the surface, like tape.
p246
aVLike if we had a piece of tape now, we'd peel it this way.
p247
aVThey do this with their toes. It's bizarre! This peeling inspired
p248
aViRobot \u2014 that we work with \u2014 to build Mecho-Geckos.
p249
aVHere's a legged version and a tractor version, or a bulldozer version.
p250
aVLet's see some of the geckos move with some video,
p251
aVand then I'll show you a little bit of a clip of the robots.
p252
aVHere's the gecko running up a vertical surface. There it goes,
p253
aVin real time. There it goes again. Obviously, we have to slow this down a little bit.
p254
aa(lp255
VYou can't use regular cameras.
p256
aVYou have to take 1,000 pictures per second to see this.
p257
aVAnd here's some video at 1,000 frames per second.
p258
aVNow, I want you to look at the animal's back.
p259
aVDo you see how much it's bending like that? We can't figure that out \u2014
p260
aVthat's an unsolved mystery. We don't know how it works.
p261
aVIf you have a son or a daughter that wants to come to Berkeley,
p262
aVcome to my lab and we'll figure this out. Okay, send them to Berkeley
p263
aVbecause that's the next thing I want to do. Here's the gecko mill.
p264
aa(lp265
V(Laughter)
p266
aa(lp267
VIt's a see-through treadmill with a see-through treadmill belt,
p268
aVso we can watch the animal's feet, and videotape them
p269
aVthrough the treadmill belt, to see how they move.
p270
aVHere's the animal that we have here, running on a vertical surface.
p271
aVPick a foot and try to watch a toe, and see if you can see what the animal's doing.
p272
aVSee it uncurl and then peel these toes.
p273
aVIt can do this in 14 milliseconds. It's unbelievable.
p274
aVHere are the robots that they inspire, the Mecho-Geckos from iRobot.
p275
aVFirst we'll see the animals toes peeling \u2014 look at that.
p276
aVAnd here's the peeling action of the Mecho-Gecko.
p277
aVIt uses a pressure-sensitive adhesive to do it.
p278
aVPeeling in the animal. Peeling in the Mecho-Gecko \u2014
p279
aVthat allows them climb autonomously. Can go on the flat surface,
p280
aVtransition to a wall, and then go onto a ceiling.
p281
aVThere's the bulldozer version. Now, it doesn't use pressure-sensitive glue.
p282
aVThe animal does not use that.
p283
aVBut that's what we're limited to, at the moment.
p284
aa(lp285
VWhat does the animal do? The animal has weird toes.
p286
aVAnd if you look at the toes, they have these little leaves there,
p287
aVand if you blow them up and zoom in, you'll see
p288
aVthat's there's little striations in these leaves.
p289
aVAnd if you zoom in 270 times, you'll see it looks like a rug.
p290
aVAnd if you blow that up, and zoom in 900 times,
p291
aVyou see there are hairs there, tiny hairs. And if you look carefully,
p292
aVthose tiny hairs have striations. And if you zoom in on those 30,000 times,
p293
aVyou'll see each hair has split ends.
p294
aVAnd if you blow those up, they have these little structures on the end.
p295
aVThe smallest branch of the hairs looks like spatulae,
p296
aVand an animal like that has one billion of these nano-size split ends,
p297
aVto get very close to the surface. In fact, there's the diameter of your hair \u2014
p298
aVa gecko has two million of these, and each hair has 100 to 1,000 split ends.
p299
aVThink of the contact of that that's possible.
p300
aa(lp301
VWe were fortunate to work with another group
p302
aVat Stanford that built us a special manned sensor,
p303
aVthat we were able to measure the force of an individual hair.
p304
aVHere's an individual hair with a little split end there.
p305
aVWhen we measured the forces, they were enormous.
p306
aVThey were so large that a patch of hairs about this size \u2014
p307
aVthe gecko's foot could support the weight of a small child,
p308
aVabout 40 pounds, easily. Now, how do they do it?
p309
aVWe've recently discovered this. Do they do it by friction?
p310
aVNo, force is too low. Do they do it by electrostatics?
p311
aVNo, you can change the charge \u2014 they still hold on.
p312
aVDo they do it by interlocking? That's kind of a like a Velcro-like thing.
p313
aVNo, you can put them on molecular smooth surfaces \u2014 they don't do it.
p314
aVHow about suction? They stick on in a vacuum.
p315
aVHow about wet adhesion? Or capillary adhesion?
p316
aVThey don't have any glue, and they even stick under water just fine.
p317
aVIf you put their foot under water, they grab on.
p318
aVHow do they do it then? Believe it or not, they grab on
p319
aVby intermolecular forces, by Van der Waals forces.
p320
aa(lp321
VYou know, you probably had this a long time ago in chemistry,
p322
aVwhere you had these two atoms, they're close together,
p323
aVand the electrons are moving around. That tiny force is sufficient
p324
aVto allow them to do that because it's added up so many times
p325
aVwith these small structures.
p326
aVWhat we're doing is, we're taking that inspiration of the hairs,
p327
aVand with another colleague at Berkeley, we're manufacturing them.
p328
aVAnd just recently we've made a breakthrough, where we now believe
p329
aVwe're going to be able to create the first synthetic, self-cleaning,
p330
aVdry adhesive. Many companies are interested in this.
p331
aa(lp332
V(Laughter)
p333
aa(lp334
VWe also presented to Nike even.
p335
aa(lp336
V(Laughter)
p337
aa(lp338
V(Applause)
p339
aa(lp340
VWe'll see where this goes. We were so excited about this
p341
aVthat we realized that that small-size scale \u2014
p342
aVand where everything gets sticky, and gravity doesn't matter anymore \u2014
p343
aVwe needed to look at ants and their feet, because
p344
aVone of my other colleagues at Berkeley has built a six-millimeter silicone
p345
aVrobot with legs. But it gets stuck. It doesn't move very well.
p346
aVBut the ants do, and we'll figure out why, so that ultimately
p347
aVwe'll make this move. And imagine: you're going to be able
p348
aVto have swarms of these six-millimeter robots available to run around.
p349
aVWhere's this going? I think you can see it already.
p350
aa(lp351
VClearly, the Internet is already having eyes and ears,
p352
aVyou have web cams and so forth. But it's going to also have legs and hands.
p353
aVYou're going to be able to do programmable
p354
aVwork through these kinds of robots, so that you can run,
p355
aVfly and swim anywhere. We saw David Kelly is at the beginning of that with his fish.
p356
aVSo, in conclusion, I think the message is clear.
p357
aVIf you need a message, if nature's not enough, if you care about
p358
aVsearch and rescue, or mine clearance, or medicine,
p359
aVor the various things we're working on, we must preserve
p360
aVnature's designs, otherwise these secrets will be lost forever.
p361
aVThank you.

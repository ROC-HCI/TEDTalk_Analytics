VI'll start with my favorite muse, Emily Dickinson,
p5
aVwho said that wonder is not knowledge, neither is it ignorance.
p6
aVIt's something which is suspended
p7
aVbetween what we believe we can be,
p8
aVand a tradition we may have forgotten.
p9
aVAnd I think, when I listen to these incredible people here,
p10
aVI've been so inspired \u2014 so many incredible ideas, so many visions.
p11
aVAnd yet, when I look at the environment outside,
p12
aVyou see how resistant architecture is to change.
p13
aVYou see how resistant it is to those very ideas.
p14
aVWe can think them out. We can create incredible things.
p15
aVAnd yet, at the end,
p16
aVit's so hard to change a wall.
p17
aVWe applaud the well-mannered box.
p18
aVBut to create a space that never existed is what interests me;
p19
aVto create something that has never been,
p20
aVa space that we have never entered except in our minds and our spirits.
p21
aVAnd I think that's really what architecture is based on.
p22
aa(lp23
VArchitecture is not based on concrete
p24
aVand steel and the elements of the soil.
p25
aVIt's based on wonder.
p26
aVAnd that wonder is really what has created the greatest cities,
p27
aVthe greatest spaces that we have had.
p28
aVAnd I think that is indeed what architecture is. It is a story.
p29
aVBy the way, it is a story that is told through
p30
aVits hard materials.
p31
aVBut it is a story of effort and struggle
p32
aVagainst improbabilities.
p33
aVIf you think of the great buildings, of the cathedrals, of the temples,
p34
aVof the pyramids, of pagodas,
p35
aVof cities in India and beyond,
p36
aVyou think of how incredible this is that that was realized
p37
aVnot by some abstract idea, but by people.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo, anything that has been made can be unmade.
p40
aVAnything that has been made can be made better.
p41
aVThere it is: the things that I really believe
p42
aVare of important architecture.
p43
aVThese are the dimensions that I like to work with.
p44
aVIt's something very personal.
p45
aVIt's not, perhaps, the dimensions appreciated by art critics
p46
aVor architecture critics or city planners.
p47
aVBut I think these are the necessary oxygen
p48
aVfor us to live in buildings, to live in cities,
p49
aVto connect ourselves in a social space.
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd I therefore believe that optimism is what drives architecture forward.
p52
aVIt's the only profession where you have to believe in the future.
p53
aVYou can be a general, a politician, an economist who is depressed,
p54
aVa musician in a minor key, a painter in dark colors.
p55
aVBut architecture is that complete ecstasy that the future can be better.
p56
aVAnd it is that belief that I think drives society.
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd today we have a kind of evangelical pessimism all around us.
p59
aVAnd yet it is in times like this
p60
aVthat I think architecture can thrive with big ideas,
p61
aVideas that are not small. Think of the great cities.
p62
aVThink of the Empire State Building, the Rockefeller Center.
p63
aVThey were built in times that were
p64
aVnot really the best of times in a certain way.
p65
aVAnd yet that energy and power of architecture
p66
aVhas driven an entire social and political space that these buildings occupy.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo again, I am a believer in the expressive.
p69
aVI have never been a fan of the neutral.
p70
aVI don't like neutrality in life, in anything.
p71
aVI think expression.
p72
aVAnd it's like espresso coffee, you know, you take the essence of the coffee.
p73
aVThat's what expression is.
p74
aVIt's been missing in much of the architecture,
p75
aVbecause we think architecture is the realm of the neutered,
p76
aVthe realm of the kind of a state that has no opinion,
p77
aVthat has no value.
p78
aVAnd yet, I believe it is the expression \u2014
p79
aVexpression of the city, expression of our own space \u2014
p80
aVthat gives meaning to architecture.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd, of course, expressive spaces are not mute.
p83
aVExpressive spaces are not spaces
p84
aVthat simply confirm what we already know.
p85
aVExpressive spaces may disturb us.
p86
aVAnd I think that's also part of life.
p87
aVLife is not just an anesthetic to make us smile,
p88
aVbut to reach out across the abyss of history,
p89
aVto places we have never been,
p90
aVand would have perhaps been, had we not been so lucky.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo again, radical versus conservative.
p93
aVRadical, what does it mean? It's something which is rooted,
p94
aVand something which is rooted deep in a tradition.
p95
aVAnd I think that is what architecture is, it's radical.
p96
aVIt's not just a conservation in formaldehyde
p97
aVof dead forms.
p98
aVIt is actually a living connection
p99
aVto the cosmic event that we are part of,
p100
aVand a story that is certainly ongoing.
p101
aVIt's not something that has a good ending or a bad ending.
p102
aVIt's actually a story in which our acts themselves
p103
aVare pushing the story in a particular way.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo again I am a believer in the radical architecture.
p106
aVYou know the Soviet architecture of that building
p107
aVis the conservation.
p108
aVIt's like the old Las Vegas used to be.
p109
aVIt's about conserving emotions, conserving the traditions
p110
aVthat have obstructed the mind in moving forward
p111
aVand of course what is radical is to confront them.
p112
aVAnd I think our architecture is a confrontation
p113
aVwith our own senses.
p114
aVTherefore I believe it should not be cool.
p115
aa(lp116
VThere is a lot of appreciation for the kind of cool architecture.
p117
aVI've always been an opponent of it. I think emotion is needed.
p118
aVLife without emotion would really not be life.
p119
aVEven the mind is emotional.
p120
aVThere is no reason which does not take a position
p121
aVin the ethical sphere, in the philosophical mystery of what we are.
p122
aVSo I think emotion is a dimension
p123
aVthat is important to introduce into city space, into city life.
p124
aa(lp125
VAnd of course, we are all about the struggle of emotions.
p126
aVAnd I think that is what makes the world a wondrous place.
p127
aVAnd of course, the confrontation of the cool, the unemotional with emotion,
p128
aVis a conversation that I think
p129
aVcities themselves have fostered.
p130
aVI think that is the progress of cities.
p131
aVIt's not only the forms of cities,
p132
aVbut the fact that they incarnate emotions,
p133
aVnot just of those who build them,
p134
aVbut of those who live there as well.
p135
aa(lp136
VInexplicable versus understood. You know, too often we want to understand everything.
p137
aVBut architecture is not the language of words.
p138
aVIt's a language. But it is not a language that can be reduced
p139
aVto a series of programmatic notes that we can verbally write.
p140
aVToo many buildings that you see outside that are so banal
p141
aVtell you a story, but the story is very short,
p142
aVwhich says, "We have no story to tell you."
p143
aV(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VSo the important thing actually,
p146
aVis to introduce the actual architectural dimensions,
p147
aVwhich might be totally inexplicable in words,
p148
aVbecause they operate in proportions,
p149
aVin materials, in light.
p150
aVThey connect themselves into various sources,
p151
aVinto a kind of complex vector matrix
p152
aVthat isn't really frontal
p153
aVbut is really embedded in the lives,
p154
aVand in the history of a city, and of a people.
p155
aVSo again, the notion that a building should just be explicit
p156
aVI think is a false notion,
p157
aVwhich has reduced architecture into banality.
p158
aa(lp159
VHand versus the computer.
p160
aVOf course, what would we be without computers?
p161
aVOur whole practice depends on computing.
p162
aVBut the computer should not just be the glove of the hand;
p163
aVthe hand should really be the driver of the computing power.
p164
aVBecause I believe that the hand
p165
aVin all its primitive, in all its physiological obscurity,
p166
aVhas a source, though the source is unknown,
p167
aVthough we don't have to be mystical about it.
p168
aVWe realize that the hand has been given us
p169
aVby forces that are beyond our own autonomy.
p170
aVAnd I think when I draw drawings
p171
aVwhich may imitate the computer, but are not computer drawings \u2014
p172
aVdrawings that can come from sources
p173
aVthat are completely not known, not normal, not seen,
p174
aVyet the hand \u2014 and that's what I really, to all of you who are working \u2014
p175
aVhow can we make the computer respond to our hand
p176
aVrather than the hand responding to the computer.
p177
aa(lp178
VI think that's part of what the complexity of architecture is.
p179
aVBecause certainly we have gotten used to the propaganda
p180
aVthat the simple is the good. But I don't believe it.
p181
aVListening to all of you, the complexity of thought,
p182
aVthe complexity of layers of meaning is overwhelming.
p183
aVAnd I think we shouldn't shy away in architecture,
p184
aVYou know, brain surgery, atomic theory,
p185
aVgenetics, economics
p186
aVare complex complex fields.
p187
aVThere is no reason that architecture should shy away
p188
aVand present this illusory world of the simple.
p189
aVIt is complex. Space is complex.
p190
aVSpace is something that folds out of itself into completely new worlds.
p191
aVAnd as wondrous as it is,
p192
aVit cannot be reduced to a kind of simplification
p193
aVthat we have often come to be admired.
p194
aVAnd yet, our lives are complex.
p195
aVOur emotions are complex.
p196
aVOur intellectual desires are complex.
p197
aVSo I do believe that architecture as I see it
p198
aVneeds to mirror that complexity in every single space that we have,
p199
aVin every intimacy that we possess.
p200
aa(lp201
VOf course that means that architecture is political.
p202
aVThe political is not an enemy of architecture.
p203
aVThe politeama is the city. It's all of us together.
p204
aVAnd I've always believed that the act of architecture,
p205
aVeven a private house, when somebody else will see it, is a political act,
p206
aVbecause it will be visible to others.
p207
aVAnd we live in a world which is connecting us more and more.
p208
aVSo again, the evasion of that sphere,
p209
aVwhich has been so endemic to that sort of pure architecture,
p210
aVthe autonomous architecture that is just an abstract object
p211
aVhas never appealed to me.
p212
aVAnd I do believe that this interaction
p213
aVwith the history, with history that is often very difficult,
p214
aVto grapple with it, to create
p215
aVa position that is beyond our normal expectations and to create a critique.
p216
aa(lp217
VBecause architecture is also the asking of questions.
p218
aVIt's not only the giving of answers.
p219
aVIt's also, just like life, the asking of questions.
p220
aVTherefore it is important that it be real.
p221
aVYou know we can simulate almost anything.
p222
aVBut the one thing that can be ever simulated
p223
aVis the human heart, the human soul.
p224
aVAnd architecture is so closely intertwined with it
p225
aVbecause we are born somewhere and we die somewhere.
p226
aVSo the reality of architecture is visceral. It's not intellectual.
p227
aVIt's not something that comes to us from books and theories.
p228
aVIt's the real that we touch \u2014 the door, the window,
p229
aVthe threshold, the bed \u2014
p230
aVsuch prosaic objects. And yet,
p231
aVI try, in every building, to take that virtual world,
p232
aVwhich is so enigmatic and so rich,
p233
aVand create something in the real world.
p234
aVCreate a space for an office,
p235
aVa space of sustainability
p236
aVthat really works between that virtuality
p237
aVand yet can be realized as something real.
p238
aa(lp239
VUnexpected versus habitual.
p240
aVWhat is a habit? It's just a shackle for ourselves.
p241
aVIt's a self-induced poison.
p242
aVSo the unexpected is always unexpected.
p243
aVYou know, it's true, the cathedrals, as unexpected,
p244
aVwill always be unexpected.
p245
aVYou know Frank Gehry's buildings, they will continue to be unexpected in the future.
p246
aVSo not the habitual architecture that instills in us
p247
aVthe false sort of stability,
p248
aVbut an architecture that is full of tension,
p249
aVan architecture that goes beyond itself
p250
aVto reach a human soul and a human heart,
p251
aVand that breaks out of the shackles of habits.
p252
aa(lp253
VAnd of course habits are enforced by architecture.
p254
aVWhen we see the same kind of architecture
p255
aVwe become immured in that world of those angles,
p256
aVof those lights, of those materials.
p257
aVWe think the world really looks like our buildings.
p258
aVAnd yet our buildings are pretty much limited by the techniques and wonders
p259
aVthat have been part of them.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo again, the unexpected which is also the raw.
p262
aVAnd I often think of the raw and the refined.
p263
aVWhat is raw? The raw, I would say
p264
aVis the naked experience, untouched by luxury,
p265
aVuntouched by expensive materials,
p266
aVuntouched by the kind of refinement
p267
aVthat we associate with high culture.
p268
aVSo the rawness, I think, in space,
p269
aVthe fact that sustainability can actually, in the future
p270
aVtranslate into a raw space,
p271
aVa space that isn't decorated,
p272
aVa space that is not mannered in any source,
p273
aVbut a space that might be cool in terms of its temperature,
p274
aVmight be refractive to our desires.
p275
aVA space that doesn't always follow us
p276
aVlike a dog that has been trained to follow us,
p277
aVbut moves ahead into directions of demonstrating
p278
aVother possibilities, other experiences,
p279
aVthat have never been part of the vocabulary of architecture.
p280
aa(lp281
VAnd of course that juxtaposition is of great interest to me
p282
aVbecause it creates a kind of a spark of new energy.
p283
aVAnd so I do like something which is pointed, not blunt,
p284
aVsomething which is focused on reality,
p285
aVsomething that has the power, through its leverage,
p286
aVto transform even a very small space.
p287
aa(lp288
VSo architecture maybe is not so big, like science,
p289
aVbut through its focal point
p290
aVit can leverage in an Archimedian way
p291
aVwhat we think the world is really about.
p292
aVAnd often it takes just a building
p293
aVto change our experience of what could be done, what has been done,
p294
aVhow the world has remained both in between stability and instability.
p295
aVAnd of course buildings have their shapes.
p296
aVThose shapes are difficult to change.
p297
aVAnd yet, I do believe that in every social space,
p298
aVin every public space,
p299
aVthere is a desire to communicate more
p300
aVthan just that blunt thought, that blunt technique,
p301
aVbut something that pinpoints, and can point in various directions
p302
aVforward, backward, sideways and around.
p303
aVSo that is indeed what is memory.
p304
aVSo I believe that my main interest is to memory.
p305
aVWithout memory we would be amnesiacs.
p306
aVWe would not know which way we were going,
p307
aVand why we are going where we're going.
p308
aa(lp309
VSo I've been never interested in the forgettable reuse,
p310
aVrehashing of the same things over and over again,
p311
aVwhich, of course, get accolades of critics.
p312
aVCritics like the performance to be repeated again and again the same way.
p313
aVBut I rather play something
p314
aVcompletely unheard of,
p315
aVand even with flaws,
p316
aVthan repeat the same thing over and over which has been hollowed
p317
aVby its meaninglessness.
p318
aVSo again, memory is the city, memory is the world.
p319
aVWithout the memory there would be no story to tell.
p320
aVThere would be nowhere to turn.
p321
aa(lp322
VThe memorable, I think, is really our world, what we think the world is.
p323
aVAnd it's not only our memory,
p324
aVbut those who remember us,
p325
aVwhich means that architecture is not mute.
p326
aVIt's an art of communication.
p327
aVIt tells a story. The story can reach into obscure desires.
p328
aVIt can reach into sources that are not explicitly available.
p329
aVIt can reach into millennia
p330
aVthat have been buried,
p331
aVand return them in a just and unexpected equity.
p332
aa(lp333
VSo again, I think the notion that
p334
aVthe best architecture is silent has never appealed to me.
p335
aVSilence maybe is good for a cemetery but not for a city.
p336
aVCities should be full of vibrations, full of sound, full of music.
p337
aVAnd that indeed is the architectural mission
p338
aVthat I believe is important,
p339
aVis to create spaces that are vibrant,
p340
aVthat are pluralistic,
p341
aVthat can transform the most prosaic activities,
p342
aVand raise them to a completely different expectation.
p343
aVCreate a shopping center, a swimming place
p344
aVthat is more like a museum than like entertainment.
p345
aVAnd these are our dreams.
p346
aa(lp347
VAnd of course risk. I think architecture should be risky.
p348
aVYou know it costs a lot of money and so on, but yes,
p349
aVit should not play it safe.
p350
aVIt should not play it safe, because if it plays it safe
p351
aVit's not moving us in a direction that we want to be.
p352
aVAnd I think, of course,
p353
aVrisk is what underlies the world.
p354
aVWorld without risk would not be worth living.
p355
aVSo yes, I do believe that the risk we take in every building.
p356
aVRisks to create spaces that have never been cantilevered to that extent.
p357
aVRisks of spaces that have never been
p358
aVso dizzying,
p359
aVas they should be, for a pioneering city.
p360
aVRisks that really move architecture
p361
aVeven with all its flaws, into a space which is much better
p362
aVthat the ever again repeated
p363
aVhollowness of a ready-made thing.
p364
aa(lp365
VAnd of course that is finally what I believe architecture to be.
p366
aVIt's about space. It's not about fashion.
p367
aVIt's not about decoration.
p368
aVIt's about creating with minimal means
p369
aVsomething which can not be repeated,
p370
aVcannot be simulated in any other sphere.
p371
aVAnd there of course is the space that we need to breathe,
p372
aVis the space we need to dream.
p373
aVThese are the spaces that are
p374
aVnot just luxurious spaces for some of us,
p375
aVbut are important for everybody in this world.
p376
aa(lp377
VSo again, it's not about the changing fashions, changing theories.
p378
aVIt's about carving out a space for trees.
p379
aVIt's carving out a space where nature can enter
p380
aVthe domestic world of a city.
p381
aVA space where something which has never seen a light of day
p382
aVcan enter into the inner workings of a density.
p383
aVAnd I think that is really the nature of architecture.
p384
aa(lp385
VNow I am a believer in democracy.
p386
aVI don't like beautiful buildings
p387
aVbuilt for totalitarian regimes.
p388
aVWhere people cannot speak, cannot vote, cannot do anything.
p389
aVWe too often admire those buildings. We think they are beautiful.
p390
aVAnd yet when I think of the poverty of society
p391
aVwhich doesn't give freedom to its people,
p392
aVI don't admire those buildings.
p393
aVSo democracy, as difficult as it is, I believe in it.
p394
aa(lp395
VAnd of course, at Ground Zero what else?
p396
aVIt's such a complex project.
p397
aVIt's emotional. There is so many interests.
p398
aVIt's political. There is so many parties to this project.
p399
aVThere is so many interests. There's money. There's political power.
p400
aVThere are emotions of the victims.
p401
aVAnd yet, in all its messiness, in all its difficulties,
p402
aVI would not have liked somebody to say,
p403
aV"This is the tabula rasa, mister architect \u2014 do whatever you want."
p404
aVI think nothing good will come out of that.
p405
aa(lp406
VI think architecture is about consensus.
p407
aVAnd it is about the dirty word "compromise." Compromise is not bad.
p408
aVCompromise, if it's artistic,
p409
aVif it is able to cope with its strategies \u2014
p410
aVand there is my first sketch and the last rendering \u2014
p411
aVit's not that far away.
p412
aVAnd yet, compromise, consensus,
p413
aVthat is what I believe in.
p414
aVAnd Ground Zero, despite all its difficulties, it's moving forward.
p415
aVIt's difficult. 2011, 2013. Freedom Tower, the memorial.
p416
aVAnd that is where I end.
p417
aa(lp418
VI was inspired when I came here as an immigrant
p419
aVon a ship like millions of others,
p420
aVlooking at America from that point of view.
p421
aVThis is America. This is liberty.
p422
aVThis is what we dream about. Its individuality,
p423
aVdemonstrated in the skyline. It's resilience.
p424
aVAnd finally, it's the freedom that America represents,
p425
aVnot just to me, as an immigrant, but to everyone in the world. Thank you.
p426
aa(lp427
V(Applause)
p428
aa(lp429
VChris Anderson: I've got a question.
p430
aVSo have you come to peace
p431
aVwith the process that happened at Ground Zero
p432
aVand the loss of the original, incredible design that you came up with?
p433
aa(lp434
VDaniel Libeskind: Look. We have to cure ourselves
p435
aVof the notion that we are authoritarian,
p436
aVthat we can determine everything that happens.
p437
aVWe have to rely on others, and shape the process in the best way possible.
p438
aVI came from the Bronx. I was taught not to be a loser,
p439
aVnot to be somebody who just gives up in a fight.
p440
aVYou have to fight for what you believe. You don't always win
p441
aVeverything you want to win. But you can steer the process.

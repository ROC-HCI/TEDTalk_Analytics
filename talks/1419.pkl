VI'm a process engineer, I know all about boilers and incinerators
p5
aVand fabric filters, and cyclones, and things like that.
p6
aVBut I also have Marfan syndrome.
p7
aVThis is an inherited disorder.
p8
aVAnd in 1992, I participated in a genetic study,
p9
aVand found to my horror, as you can see from the slide,
p10
aVthat my ascending aorta was not in the normal range,
p11
aVthe green line at the bottom.
p12
aVEveryone in here will be between 3.2-3.6,
p13
aVand I was already up at 4.4.
p14
aVAnd as you can see, my aorta dilated progressively,
p15
aVand I got closer and closer to the point where surgery was going to be necessary.
p16
aa(lp17
VThe surgery on offer was pretty gruesome.
p18
aVAnesthetize you, open your chest,
p19
aVput you on an artificial heart and lung machine,
p20
aVdrop your body temperature to about 18 centigrade,
p21
aVstop your heart, cut the aorta out,
p22
aVreplace it with a plastic valve and a plastic aorta.
p23
aVAnd most importantly, commit you to a lifetime of anticoagulation therapy.
p24
aVNormally, warfarin.
p25
aVThe thought of the surgery was not attractive.
p26
aVThe thought of the warfarin was really quite frightening.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo I said to myself,
p29
aV"I'm an engineer, I'm in R&D, this is just a plumbing problem."
p30
aV"I can do this, I can change this."
p31
aVSo I set out to change the entire treatment for aortic dilation.
p32
aVThe project aim is really quite simple.
p33
aVThe only real problem with the ascending aorta
p34
aVin people with Marfan syndrome
p35
aVis that it lacks some tensile strength.
p36
aVSo, the possibility exists to simply externally wrap the pipe,
p37
aVand it would remain stable and operate quite happily.
p38
aVIf your high-pressure hose pipe or hydraulic line bulges a little,
p39
aVyou just wrap some tape around it, it really is that simple.
p40
aVIn concept, though not in execution.
p41
aVThe great advantage of an external support, for me,
p42
aVwas that I could retain all of my own bits,
p43
aVall of my own endothelium and valves,
p44
aVand not need any anticoagulation therapy.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo, where do we start?
p47
aVThis is a sagittal slice through me.
p48
aVIn the middle, you can see that little structure squeezing out,
p49
aVthat's the left ventricle,
p50
aVpushing blood out through the aortic valve.
p51
aVYou can see two of the leaflets of the aortic valve working there.
p52
aVUp into the ascending aorta.
p53
aVAnd it's that part, the ascending aorta,
p54
aVwhich dilates and ultimately bursts, which of course is fatal.
p55
aVWe started by organizing image acquisition
p56
aVfrom magnetic resonance and CT imaging machines,
p57
aVfrom which to make a model of the patient's aorta.
p58
aa(lp59
VThis is a model of my aorta.
p60
aVI've got a real one in my pocket,
p61
aVif anyone would like to look at it, and play with it.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VYou can see it's quite a complex structure.
p66
aVIt has a funny tri-lobal shape at the bottom,
p67
aVwhich contains the aortic valve.
p68
aVIt then comes back into a round form,
p69
aVand then tapers and curves off.
p70
aVIt's quite a difficult structure to produce.
p71
aVThis is a sort of CAD model of me,
p72
aVand this is one of the later CAD models.
p73
aVWe went through an iterative process of producing better and better models.
p74
aVWhen we produced that model,
p75
aVwe turned it into a solid, plastic model, as you can see,
p76
aVusing a rapid prototyping technique, another engineering technique.
p77
aVWe then used that former
p78
aVto manufacture a perfectly bespoke porous textile mesh,
p79
aVwhich takes the shape of the former and perfectly fits the aorta.
p80
aVSo this is absolutely personalized medicine at its best, really.
p81
aVEvery patient we do has an absolutely bespoke implant.
p82
aa(lp83
VOnce you've made it, the installation is quite easy.
p84
aVJohn Pepper, bless his heart, professor of cardiothoracic surgery.
p85
aVNever done it before in his life, he put the first one in, didn't like it,
p86
aVhe put the second one in.
p87
aVHappy, away I went.
p88
aVFour and a half hours on the table, and everything was done.
p89
aVSo the surgical implantation was actually the easiest part.
p90
aa(lp91
VIf you compare our new treatment to the existing alternative,
p92
aVthe composite aortic root graft,
p93
aVthere are one or two startling comparisons
p94
aVwhich I'm sure will be clear to all of you.
p95
aVTwo hours to install one of our devices,
p96
aVcompared to 6 hours for the existing treatment.
p97
aVAs I said, the existing treatment requires the heart-lung bypass machine,
p98
aVand it requires a total body cooling.
p99
aVWe don't need any of that. We work on a beating heart.
p100
aVHe opens you up,
p101
aVhe accesses the aorta while your heart is beating,
p102
aVall at the right temperature.
p103
aVNo breaking into your circulatory system.
p104
aVSo it really is great.
p105
aa(lp106
VBut for me, absolutely the best point is,
p107
aVthere is no anticoagulation therapy required.
p108
aVI don't take any drugs at all,
p109
aVother than recreational ones that I would choose to take.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VAnd in fact, if you speak to people who are on long-term warfarin,
p114
aVit is a serious compromise to your quality of life,
p115
aVand even worse, it inevitably foreshortens your life.
p116
aVLikewise, if you have the artificial valve option,
p117
aVyou're committed to antibiotic therapy
p118
aVwhenever you have any intrusive medical treatment,
p119
aVeven trips to the dentist require that you take antibiotics,
p120
aVin case you get an internal infection on the valve.
p121
aVAgain, I don't have any of that, so I'm entirely free,
p122
aVmy artery is fixed.
p123
aVI haven't got to worry about it, which is a rebirth for me.
p124
aa(lp125
VBack to the theme of the presentation, multidisciplinary research,
p126
aVhow on earth does a process engineer used to working with boilers
p127
aVend up producing a medical device which transforms his own life?
p128
aVWell, the answer to that is, a multidisciplinary team.
p129
aVThis is a list of the core team,
p130
aVand you can see there aren't only two principal technical disciplines there,
p131
aVmedicine and engineering,
p132
aVbut also, there are various specialists from within those two disciplines.
p133
aVJohn Pepper was the cardiac surgeon who did all the actual work on me.
p134
aVBut everyone else had to contribute one way or another.
p135
aVRaad Mohiaddin, a medical radiologist.
p136
aVWe had to get good-quality images from which to make the CAD model.
p137
aVWarren Thornton, who still does all our CAD models for us,
p138
aVhad to write a bespoke piece of CAD code
p139
aVto produce this model from this really rather difficult input data set.
p140
aa(lp141
VThere are some barriers to this, though, there are some problems.
p142
aVJargon is a big one.
p143
aVI would think no one in this room understands the first four jargon points.
p144
aVThe engineers amongst you will recognize "rapid prototyping" and "CAD."
p145
aVThe medics amongst you, if there are any, will recognize the first two,
p146
aVbut there will be nobody else here that understands all those four words.
p147
aVTaking the jargon out was very important
p148
aVto ensure that everyone in the team understood exactly what was meant
p149
aVwhen a particular phrase was used.
p150
aa(lp151
VOur disciplinary conventions were funny as well.
p152
aVWe took a lot of horizontal slice images through me,
p153
aVproduced those slices and used them to build a CAD model.
p154
aVAnd the very first CAD model we made,
p155
aVthe surgeons were playing with it and couldn't quite figure it out.
p156
aVAnd then we realized that it was actually a mirror image of the real aorta.
p157
aVAnd it was a mirror image because in the real world,
p158
aVwe always look down on plans,
p159
aVplans of houses, or streets, or maps.
p160
aVIn the medical world, they look up at plans.
p161
aVSo the horizontal images were all in inversion.
p162
aVSo, one needs to be careful with disciplinary conventions.
p163
aVEveryone needs to understand what is assumed and what is not.
p164
aa(lp165
VInstitutional barriers were another serious headache in the project.
p166
aVThe Brompton Hospital was taken over
p167
aVby the Imperial College School of Medicine.
p168
aVAnd there are some seriously bad relationship problems
p169
aVbetween the two organizations.
p170
aVI was working with the Imperial and the Brompton,
p171
aVand this generated some serious problems for the project.
p172
aVReally, problems that shouldn't exist.
p173
aa(lp174
VResearch & Ethics Committee.
p175
aVIf you want to do anything new in surgery,
p176
aVyou have to get a license from your local Research & Ethics.
p177
aVI'm sure it's the same in Poland.
p178
aVThere will be some form of equivalent which licenses new types of surgery.
p179
aVWe didn't only have the bureaucratic problems associated with that,
p180
aVwe also had professional jealousies.
p181
aVThere were people on the Research & Ethics committee
p182
aVwho really didn't want to see John Pepper succeed again.
p183
aVBecause he is so successful.
p184
aVAnd they made extra problems for us.
p185
aa(lp186
VBureaucratic problems.
p187
aVUltimately, when you have a new treatment,
p188
aVyou have to have a guidance note for all the hospitals in the country.
p189
aVIn the UK, we have the National Institute and Clinical Excellence.
p190
aVYou have an equivalent in Poland, no doubt.
p191
aVAnd we had to get past the NICE problem.
p192
aVWe now have a great clinical guidance, out on the net.
p193
aVSo any other hospitals interested can come along, read the NICE report,
p194
aVget in touch with us, and then get doing it themselves.
p195
aa(lp196
VFunding barriers, another big area to be concerned with.
p197
aVA big problem with understanding one of those perspectives.
p198
aVWhen we first approached one of the big, charitable UK organizations
p199
aVthat fund this kind of stuff,
p200
aVwe essentially gave them an engineering proposal.
p201
aVThey didn't understand it, they were doctors, next to God,
p202
aVit must be rubbish, they binned it.
p203
aVSo in the end, I went after private investors, just gave up on it.
p204
aVMost R&D is going to be institutionally funded,
p205
aVby the Polish Academy of Sciences
p206
aVor the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, or whatever.
p207
aVAnd you need to get past those people.
p208
aa(lp209
VJargon is a huge problem when you try to work across disciplines,
p210
aVbecause in an engineering world, we all understand CAD and RP.
p211
aVNot in the medical world.
p212
aVI suppose the funding bureaucrats ultimately have to get their act together.
p213
aVThey've really got to start talking to each other,
p214
aVand exercise a bit of imagination, if that's not too much to ask.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Laughter)
p217
aa(lp218
VWhich it probably is.
p219
aa(lp220
V(Laughter)
p221
aa(lp222
VI've coined the phrase "obstructive conservatism."
p223
aVSo many people in the medical world don't want to change.
p224
aVParticularly when some jumped-up engineer has come along with the answer.
p225
aVThey don't want to change.
p226
aVThey simply want to do whatever they've done before.
p227
aVAnd in fact, many surgeons in the UK are still waiting
p228
aVfor one of our patients to have some sort of an episode,
p229
aVso that they could say, "Told you that was no good."
p230
aVWe've actually got 30 patients.
p231
aVAt seven and a half years,
p232
aVwe've got 90 post-op patient years between us,
p233
aVand we haven't had a single problem.
p234
aVAnd still, there are people in the UK saying,
p235
aV"That external aortic root, it will never work, you know."
p236
aa(lp237
VIt really is a problem.
p238
aVI'm sure everyone in this room has come across arrogance
p239
aVamongst medics, doctors, surgeons, at some point.
p240
aVThe middle point is simply the way that the doctors protect themselves.
p241
aV"Well, of course, I'm looking after my patient."
p242
aVI think it's not good, but that's my view.
p243
aa(lp244
VEgos, of course, again a huge problem.
p245
aVIf you work in a multidisciplinary team,
p246
aVyou've got to give your guys the benefit of the doubt,
p247
aVyou've got to express support for them.
p248
aVTom Treasure, professor of cardiothoracic surgery.
p249
aVIncredible guy.
p250
aVDead easy to give him respect.
p251
aVHim giving me respect? Slightly different.
p252
aa(lp253
V(Laughter)
p254
aa(lp255
VThat's all the bad news.
p256
aVThe good news is, the benefits are stonkingly huge.
p257
aVTranslate that one! I bet they can't.
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
VWhen you have a group of people with different professional training,
p262
aVa different professional experience,
p263
aVthey not only have a different knowledge base,
p264
aVbut also a different perspective on everything.
p265
aVAnd if you can bring them together,
p266
aVand get them talking and understanding each other,
p267
aVthe results can be spectacular.
p268
aVYou can find really novel solutions that have never been looked at before,
p269
aVvery quickly and easily.
p270
aVYou can short-cut huge amounts of work
p271
aVsimply by using the extended knowledge base you have.
p272
aVAnd as a result, it's an entirely different use
p273
aVof the technology and the knowledge around you.
p274
aa(lp275
VThe result of all this is that you can get incredibly quick progress
p276
aVon incredibly small budgets.
p277
aVI'm so embarrassed at how cheap it was to get from my idea
p278
aVto me being implanted
p279
aVthat I'm not prepared to tell you what it cost,
p280
aVbecause I suspect there are absolutely standard surgical treatments,
p281
aVprobably in the USA,
p282
aVwhich cost more for a one-off patient
p283
aVthan the cost of us getting from my dream to my reality.
p284
aa(lp285
VThat's all I want to say, and I've got three minutes left.
p286
aVSo, Ewa's going to like me.
p287
aVIf you have any questions, please come up and talk to me later on,
p288
aVit would be a pleasure to speak with you.
p289
aa(lp290
VMany thanks.

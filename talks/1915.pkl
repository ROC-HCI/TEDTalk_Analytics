VI'm McKenna Pope. I'm 14 years old,
p5
aVand when I was 13, I convinced
p6
aVone of the largest toy companies,
p7
aVtoymakers, in the world, Hasbro,
p8
aVto change the way that they marketed
p9
aVone of their most best-selling products.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo allow me to tell you about it.
p12
aVSo I have a brother, Gavin.
p13
aVWhen this whole shebang happened, he was four.
p14
aVHe loved to cook.
p15
aVHe was always getting ingredients out of the fridge
p16
aVand mixing them into these, needless to say,
p17
aVuneatable concoctions,
p18
aVor making invisible macaroni and cheese.
p19
aVHe wanted to be a chef really badly.
p20
aVAnd so what better gift for a kid who wanted to be a chef
p21
aVthan an Easy-Bake Oven. Right?
p22
aVI mean, we all had those when we were little.
p23
aVAnd he wanted one so badly.
p24
aa(lp25
VBut then he started to realize something.
p26
aVIn the commercials, and on the  boxes for the Easy-Bake Ovens,
p27
aVHasbro marketed them specifically to girls.
p28
aVAnd the way that they did this
p29
aVwas they would only feature girls on the boxes or in the commercials,
p30
aVand there would be flowery prints all over the ovens
p31
aVand it would be in bright pink and purple,
p32
aVvery gender-specific colors to females, right?
p33
aVSo it kind of was sending a message
p34
aVthat only girls are supposed to cook; boys aren't.
p35
aVAnd this discouraged my brother a lot.
p36
aVHe thought that he wasn't supposed to want to be a chef,
p37
aVbecause that was something that girls did.
p38
aVGirls cooked; boys didn't,
p39
aVor so was the message that Hasbro was sending.
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd this got me thinking,
p42
aVGod, I wish there was a way that I could change this,
p43
aVthat could I have my voice heard by Hasbro
p44
aVso I could ask them and tell them
p45
aVwhat they were doing wrong
p46
aVand ask them to change it.
p47
aVAnd that got me thinking about a website
p48
aVthat I had learned about a few months prior
p49
aVcalled Change.org.
p50
aVChange.org is an online petition-sharing platform
p51
aVwhere you can create a petition and share it
p52
aVacross all of these social media networks,
p53
aVthrough Facebook, through Twitter,
p54
aVthrough YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr,
p55
aVthrough whatever you can think of.
p56
aVAnd so I created a petition
p57
aValong with the YouTube video that I added to the petition
p58
aVbasically asking Hasbro
p59
aVto change the way that they marketed it,
p60
aVin featuring boys in the commercials, on the boxes,
p61
aVand most of all creating them
p62
aVin less gender-specific colors.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo this petition started to take off \u2014
p65
aVhumongously fast, you have no idea.
p66
aVI was getting interviewed by all these national news outlets
p67
aVand press outlets, and it was amazing.
p68
aVIn three weeks, maybe three and a half,
p69
aVI had 46,000 signatures on this petition.
p70
aa(lp71
V(Applause)
p72
aa(lp73
VThank you.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo, needless to say, it was crazy.
p76
aVEventually, Hasbro themselves invited me to their headquarters
p77
aVso they could go and unveil
p78
aVtheir new Easy-Bake Oven product to me
p79
aVin black, silver and blue.
p80
aVIt was literally one of the best moments of my life.
p81
aVIt was like "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."
p82
aVThat thing was amazing.
p83
aa(lp84
VWhat I didn't realize at the time, however,
p85
aVwas that I had become an activist,
p86
aVI could change something,
p87
aVthat even as a kid, or maybe  even especially as a kid,
p88
aVmy voice mattered, and your voice matters too.
p89
aVI want to let you know it's not going to be easy,
p90
aVand it wasn't easy for me,
p91
aVbecause I faced a lot of obstacles.
p92
aVPeople online, and sometimes even in real life,
p93
aVwere disrespectful to me and my family,
p94
aVand talked about how the whole thing was a waste of time,
p95
aVand it really discouraged me.
p96
aVAnd actually, I have some examples, because what's better revenge
p97
aVthan displaying their idiocy?
p98
aVSo, let's see.
p99
aVFrom user name Liquidsore29 \u2014
p100
aVinteresting user names we have here\u2014
p101
aV"Disgusting liberal moms making their sons gay."
p102
aVLiquidsore29, really? Really? Okay.
p103
aVHow about from Whiteboy77AGS:
p104
aV"People always need something to (female dog) about."
p105
aVFrom Jeffrey Gutierrez:
p106
aV"OMG, shut up. You just want money and attention."
p107
aa(lp108
VSo it was comments like these
p109
aVthat really discouraged me from wanting to make change in the future
p110
aVbecause I thought, people don't care,
p111
aVpeople think it's a waste of time,
p112
aVand people are going to be disrespectful  to me and my family.
p113
aVIt hurt me, and it made me think,
p114
aVwhat's the point of making change in the future?
p115
aa(lp116
VBut then I started to realize something.
p117
aVHaters gonna hate.
p118
aVCome on, say it with me. One, two, three:
p119
aVHaters gonna hate.
p120
aVSo let your haters hate,
p121
aVyou know what, and make your change,
p122
aVbecause I know you can.
p123
aVI look out into this crowd,
p124
aVand I see 400 people
p125
aVwho came out because they wanted to know how they could make a change,
p126
aVand I know that you can, and all of you watching at home can too
p127
aVbecause you have so much that you  can do and that you believe in,
p128
aVand you can trade it across all these social media,
p129
aVthrough Facebook, through Twitter, through  YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr,
p130
aVthrough whatever else you can think of.
p131
aVAnd you can make that change.
p132
aVYou can take what you believe in
p133
aVand turn it into a cause and change it.
p134
aVAnd that spark that you've been  hearing about all day today,
p135
aVyou can use that spark that you have within you
p136
aVand turn it into a fire.
p137
aa(lp138
VThank you.

today&#39;s teenagers melting their brains on the Internet, there&#39;s at least one who stands out against the crowd: teen activist McKenna Pope. In 2012 Pope&#39;s four-year-old brother, who had a passion for cooking, was beyond excited to ask for an Easy-Bake Oven for Christmas. But, confused by the pink and purple colors and the television ads that only featured girls using the toy, he became discouraged.</p><p>Pope, thirteen at the time, was indignant that her brother should think any less of himself as a boy who liked to cook. Naturally Pope turned to the Internet. She posted <a href=\\"http://www.change.org/petitions/hasbro-feature-boys-in-the-packaging-of-the-easy-bake-oven\\" target=\\"_blank\\">a video and written petition</a> urging the CEO of Hasbro to change its marketing and packaging around the <a href=\\"http://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/easy-bake-evolution/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Easy-Bake Oven</a>  to make it appealing to boys as well as girls.

VEinstein said that
p5
aV"I never think about the future \u2014 it comes soon enough."
p6
aa(lp7
VAnd he was right, of course.
p8
aVSo today, I'm here to ask you to think of
p9
aVhow the future is happening now.
p10
aVOver the past 200 years, the world has experienced
p11
aVtwo major waves of innovation.
p12
aVFirst, the Industrial Revolution
p13
aVbrought us machines and factories, railways,
p14
aVelectricity, air travel,
p15
aVand our lives have never been the same.
p16
aVThen the Internet revolution
p17
aVbrought us computing power, data networks,
p18
aVunprecedented access
p19
aVto information and communication,
p20
aVand our lives have never been the same.
p21
aa(lp22
VNow we are experiencing
p23
aVanother metamorphic change:
p24
aVthe industrial Internet.
p25
aVIt brings together intelligent machines,
p26
aVadvanced analytics,
p27
aVand the creativity of people at work.
p28
aVIt's the marriage of minds and machines.
p29
aVAnd our lives will never be the same.
p30
aa(lp31
VIn my current role, I see up close
p32
aVhow technology is beginning to transform
p33
aVindustrial sectors that play a huge role
p34
aVin our economy and in our lives:
p35
aVenergy, aviation, transportation, health care.
p36
aVFor an economist, this is highly unusual,
p37
aVand it's extremely exciting,
p38
aVbecause this is a transformation
p39
aVas powerful as the Industrial Revolution and more,
p40
aVand before the Industrial Revolution,
p41
aVthere was no economic growth to speak of.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo what is this industrial Internet?
p44
aVIndustrial machines are being equipped
p45
aVwith a growing number of electronic sensors
p46
aVthat allow them to see, hear, feel
p47
aVa lot more than ever before,
p48
aVgenerating prodigious amounts of data.
p49
aVIncreasingly sophisticated analytics
p50
aVthen sift through the data,
p51
aVproviding insights that allow us
p52
aVto operate the machines in entirely new ways,
p53
aVa lot more efficiently.
p54
aVAnd not just individual machines,
p55
aVbut fleets of locomotives, airplanes,
p56
aVentire systems like power grids, hospitals.
p57
aVIt is asset optimization and system optimization.
p58
aVOf course, electronic sensors
p59
aVhave been around for some time,
p60
aVbut something has changed:
p61
aVa sharp decline in the cost of sensors
p62
aVand, thanks to advances in cloud computing,
p63
aVa rapid decrease in the cost of storing
p64
aVand processing data.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo we are moving to a world
p67
aVwhere the machines we work with
p68
aVare not just intelligent; they are brilliant.
p69
aVThey are self-aware, they are predictive,
p70
aVreactive and social.
p71
aVIt's jet engines, locomotives, gas turbines,
p72
aVmedical devices, communicating seamlessly
p73
aVwith each other and with us.
p74
aVIt's a world where information itself
p75
aVbecomes intelligent and comes to us
p76
aVautomatically when we need it
p77
aVwithout having to look for it.
p78
aVWe are beginning to deploy
p79
aVthroughout the industrial system
p80
aVembedded virtualization,
p81
aVmulti-core processor technology,
p82
aVadvanced cloud-based communications,
p83
aVa new software-defined machine infrastructure
p84
aVwhich allows machine functionality
p85
aVto become virtualized in software,
p86
aVdecoupling machine software from hardware,
p87
aVand allowing us to remotely and automatically
p88
aVmonitor, manage and upgrade industrial assets.
p89
aa(lp90
VWhy does any of this matter at all?
p91
aVWell first of all, it's already allowing us
p92
aVto shift towards preventive,
p93
aVcondition-based maintenance,
p94
aVwhich means fixing machines
p95
aVjust before they break,
p96
aVwithout wasting time
p97
aVservicing them on a fixed schedule.
p98
aVAnd this, in turn, is pushing us towards
p99
aVzero unplanned downtime,
p100
aVwhich means there will be no more power outages,
p101
aVno more flight delays.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo let me give you a few examples
p104
aVof how these brilliant machines work,
p105
aVand some of the examples may seem trivial,
p106
aVsome are clearly more profound,
p107
aVbut all of them are going to have a very powerful impact.
p108
aa(lp109
VLet's start with aviation.
p110
aVToday, 10 percent of all flights
p111
aVcancellations and delays
p112
aVare due to unscheduled maintenance events.
p113
aVSomething goes wrong unexpectedly.
p114
aVThis results in eight billion dollars in costs
p115
aVfor the airline industry globally every year,
p116
aVnot to mention the impact on all of us:
p117
aVstress, inconvenience,
p118
aVmissed meetings as we sit helplessly
p119
aVin an airport terminal.
p120
aVSo how can the industrial Internet help here?
p121
aVWe've developed a preventive maintenance system
p122
aVwhich can be installed on any aircraft.
p123
aVIt's self-learning and able to predict issues
p124
aVthat a human operator would miss.
p125
aVThe aircraft, while in flight,
p126
aVwill communicate with technicians on the ground.
p127
aVBy the time it lands, they will already know
p128
aVif anything needs to be serviced.
p129
aVJust in the U.S., a system like this can prevent
p130
aVover 60,000 delays and cancellations every year,
p131
aVhelping seven million passengers
p132
aVget to their destinations on time.
p133
aa(lp134
VOr take healthcare.
p135
aVToday, nurses spend an average
p136
aVof 21 minutes per shift
p137
aVlooking for medical equipment.
p138
aVThat seems trivial, but it's less time spent
p139
aVcaring for patients.
p140
aVSt. Luke's Medical Center in Houston, Texas,
p141
aVwhich has deployed industrial Internet technology
p142
aVto electronically monitor and connect
p143
aVpatients, staff and medical equipment,
p144
aVhas reduced bed turnaround times
p145
aVby nearly one hour.
p146
aVIf you need surgery, one hour matters.
p147
aVIt means more patients can be treated,
p148
aVmore lives can be saved.
p149
aVAnother medical center, in Washington state,
p150
aVis piloting an application that allows
p151
aVmedical images from city scanners and MRIs
p152
aVto be analyzed in the cloud,
p153
aVdeveloping better analytics
p154
aVat a lower cost.
p155
aVImagine a patient
p156
aVwho has suffered a severe trauma,
p157
aVand needs the attention of several specialists:
p158
aVa neurologist, a cardiologist,
p159
aVan orthopedic surgeon.
p160
aVIf all of them can have instantaneous and simultaneous access
p161
aVto scans and images as they are taken,
p162
aVthey will be able to deliver better healthcare faster.
p163
aVSo all of this translates into better health outcomes,
p164
aVbut it can also deliver substantial economic benefits.
p165
aVJust a one-percent reduction in existing inefficiencies
p166
aVcould yield savings of over 60 billion dollars
p167
aVto the healthcare industry worldwide,
p168
aVand that is just a drop in the sea
p169
aVcompared to what we need to do to make healthcare
p170
aVaffordable on a sustainable basis.
p171
aa(lp172
VSimilar advances are happening in energy,
p173
aVincluding renewable energy.
p174
aVWind farms equipped with new remote monitorings and diagnostics
p175
aVthat allow wind turbines to talk to each other
p176
aVand adjust the pitch of their blades in a coordinated way,
p177
aVdepending on how the wind is blowing,
p178
aVcan now produce electricity at a cost
p179
aVof less than five cents per kilowatt/hour.
p180
aVTen years ago, that cost was 30 cents,
p181
aVsix times as much.
p182
aa(lp183
VThe list goes on, and it will grow fast,
p184
aVbecause industrial data are now growing exponentially.
p185
aVBy 2020, they will account for over 50 percent
p186
aVof all digital information.
p187
aa(lp188
VBut this is not just about data, so let me switch gears
p189
aVand tell you how this is impacting already
p190
aVthe jobs we do every day,
p191
aVbecause this new wave of innovation
p192
aVis bringing about new tools and applications
p193
aVthat will allow us to collaborate
p194
aVin a smarter and faster way,
p195
aVmaking our jobs not just more efficient
p196
aVbut more rewarding.
p197
aVImagine a field engineer arriving at the wind farm
p198
aVwith a handheld device telling her
p199
aVwhich turbines need servicing.
p200
aVShe already has all the spare parts,
p201
aVbecause the problems were diagnosed in advanced.
p202
aVAnd if she faces an unexpected issue,
p203
aVthe same handheld device will allow her to
p204
aVcommunicate with colleagues at the service center,
p205
aVlet them see what she sees,
p206
aVtransmit data that they can run through diagnostics,
p207
aVand they can stream videos that will guide her,
p208
aVstep by step, through whatever complex procedure
p209
aVis needed to get the machines back up and running.
p210
aVAnd their interaction gets documented
p211
aVand stored in a searchable database.
p212
aa(lp213
VLet's stop and think about this for a minute,
p214
aVbecause this is a very important point.
p215
aVThis new wave of innovation is fundamentally
p216
aVchanging the way we work.
p217
aVAnd I know that many of you will be concerned  about the impact that innovation might have on jobs.
p218
aVUnemployment is already high,
p219
aVand there is always a fear  that innovation will destroy jobs.
p220
aVAnd innovation is disruptive.
p221
aVBut let me stress two things here.
p222
aVFirst, we've already lived through
p223
aVmechanization of agriculture, automation of industry,
p224
aVand employment has gone up,
p225
aVbecause innovation is fundamentally about growth.
p226
aVIt makes products more affordable.
p227
aVIt creates new demand, new jobs.
p228
aVSecond, there is a concern that in the future,
p229
aVthere will only be room for engineers,
p230
aVdata scientists, and other highly-specialized workers.
p231
aVAnd believe me, as an economist, I am also scared.
p232
aVBut think about it:
p233
aVJust as a child can easily figure out
p234
aVhow to operate an iPad,
p235
aVso a new generation of mobile and intuitive
p236
aVindustrial applications will make life easier
p237
aVfor workers of all skill levels.
p238
aVThe worker of the future will be more like Iron Man
p239
aVthan the Charlie Chaplin of "Modern Times."
p240
aVAnd to be sure, new high-skilled jobs will be created:
p241
aVmechanical digital engineers who understand
p242
aVboth the machines and the data;
p243
aVmanagers who understand their industry
p244
aVand the analytics and can reorganize the business
p245
aVto take full advantage of the technology.
p246
aa(lp247
VBut now let's take a step back.
p248
aVLet's look at the big picture.
p249
aVThere are people who argue that today's innovation
p250
aVis all about social media and silly games,
p251
aVwith nowhere near the transformational power
p252
aVof the Industrial Revolution.
p253
aVThey say that all the growth-enhancing innovations
p254
aVare behind us.
p255
aVAnd every time I hear this, I can't help thinking that
p256
aVeven back in the Stone Age,
p257
aVthere must have been a group of cavemen
p258
aVsitting around a fire one day
p259
aVlooking very grumpy,
p260
aVand looking disapprovingly at another group of cavemen
p261
aVrolling a stone wheel up and down a hill,
p262
aVand saying to each other,
p263
aV"Yeah, this wheel thing,
p264
aVcool toy, sure, but compared to fire,
p265
aVit will have no impact.
p266
aVThe big discoveries are all behind us."
p267
aV(Laughter)
p268
aa(lp269
VThis technological revolution
p270
aVis as inspiring and transformational
p271
aVas anything we have ever seen.
p272
aVHuman creativity and innovation have always propelled us forward.
p273
aVThey've created jobs.
p274
aVThey've raised living standards.
p275
aVThey've made our lives
p276
aVhealthier and more rewarding.
p277
aVAnd the new wave of innovation
p278
aVwhich is beginning to sweep through industry
p279
aVis no different.
p280
aVIn the U.S. alone, the industrial Internet
p281
aVcould raise average income by 25 to 40 percent
p282
aVover the next 15 years,
p283
aVboosting growth to rates we haven't seen in a long time,
p284
aVand adding between 10 and 15 trillion dollars to global GDP.
p285
aVThat is the size of the entire U.S. economy today.
p286
aa(lp287
VBut this is not a foregone conclusion.
p288
aVWe are just at the beginning of this transformation,
p289
aVand there will be barriers to break,
p290
aVobstacles to overcome.
p291
aVWe will need to invest in the new technologies.
p292
aVWe will need to adapt organizations and managerial practices.
p293
aVWe will need a robust cybersecurity approach
p294
aVthat protects sensitive information and intellectual property
p295
aVand safeguards critical infrastructure from cyberattacks.
p296
aVAnd the education system will need to evolve
p297
aVto ensure students are equipped with the right skills.
p298
aVIt's not going to be easy,
p299
aVbut it is going to be worth it.
p300
aVThe economic challenges facing us are hard,
p301
aVbut when I walk the factory floor,
p302
aVand I see how humans and brilliant machines
p303
aVare becoming interconnected,
p304
aVand I see the difference this makes
p305
aVin a hospital, in an airport,
p306
aVin a power generation plant, I'm not just optimistic,
p307
aVI'm enthusiastic.
p308
aVThis new technological revolution is upon us.
p309
aa(lp310
VSo think about the future \u2014 it will be here soon enough.
p311
aa(lp312
VThank you.

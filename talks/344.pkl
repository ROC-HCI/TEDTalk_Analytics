VSo, a big question that we're facing now
p5
aVand have been for quite a number of years now:
p6
aVare we at risk of a nuclear attack?
p7
aVNow, there's a bigger question
p8
aVthat's probably actually more important than that,
p9
aVis the notion of permanently eliminating
p10
aVthe possibility of a nuclear attack,
p11
aVeliminating the threat altogether.
p12
aVAnd I would like to make a case to you that
p13
aVover the years since we first developed atomic weaponry,
p14
aVuntil this very moment,
p15
aVwe've actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world
p16
aVthat's characterized by two phases,
p17
aVwhich I'm going to go through with you right now.
p18
aa(lp19
VFirst of all, we started off the nuclear age in 1945.
p20
aVThe United States had developed a couple of atomic weapons
p21
aVthrough the Manhattan Project,
p22
aVand the idea was very straightforward:
p23
aVwe would use the power of the atom
p24
aVto end the atrocities and the horror
p25
aVof this unending World War II
p26
aVthat we'd been involved in in Europe and in the Pacific.
p27
aVAnd in 1945,
p28
aVwe were the only nuclear power.
p29
aVWe had a few nuclear weapons,
p30
aVtwo of which we dropped on Japan, in Hiroshima,
p31
aVa few days later in Nagasaki, in August 1945,
p32
aVkilling about 250,000 people between those two.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd for a few years,
p35
aVwe were the only nuclear power on Earth.
p36
aVBut by 1949, the Soviet Union had decided
p37
aVit was unacceptable to have us as the only nuclear power,
p38
aVand they began to match what the United States had developed.
p39
aVAnd from 1949 to 1985
p40
aVwas an extraordinary time
p41
aVof a buildup of a nuclear arsenal
p42
aVthat no one could possibly have imagined
p43
aVback in the 1940s.
p44
aVSo by 1985 \u2014 each of those red bombs up here
p45
aVis equivalent of a thousands warheads \u2014
p46
aVthe world had
p47
aV65,000 nuclear warheads,
p48
aVand seven members of something
p49
aVthat came to be known as the "nuclear club."
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd it was an extraordinary time,
p52
aVand I am going to go through some of the mentality
p53
aVthat we \u2014 that Americans and the rest of the world were experiencing.
p54
aVBut I want to just point out to you that 95 percent
p55
aVof the nuclear weapons at any particular time
p56
aVsince 1985 \u2014 going forward, of course \u2014
p57
aVwere part of the arsenals
p58
aVof the United States and the Soviet Union.
p59
aVAfter 1985, and before the break up of the Soviet Union,
p60
aVwe began to disarm
p61
aVfrom a nuclear point of view.
p62
aVWe began to counter-proliferate,
p63
aVand we dropped the number of nuclear warheads in the world
p64
aVto about a total of 21,000.
p65
aVIt's a very difficult number to deal with,
p66
aVbecause what we've done is
p67
aVwe've quote unquote "decommissioned" some of the warheads.
p68
aVThey're still probably usable. They could be "re-commissioned,"
p69
aVbut the way they count things, which is very complicated,
p70
aVwe think we have about a third
p71
aVof the nuclear weapons we had before.
p72
aVBut we also, in that period of time,
p73
aVadded two more members to the nuclear club:
p74
aVPakistan and North Korea.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo we stand today with a still fully armed nuclear arsenal
p77
aVamong many countries around the world,
p78
aVbut a very different set of circumstances.
p79
aVSo I'm going to talk about
p80
aVa nuclear threat story in two chapters.
p81
aVChapter one is 1949 to 1991,
p82
aVwhen the Soviet Union broke up,
p83
aVand what we were dealing with, at that point and through those years,
p84
aVwas a superpowers' nuclear arms race.
p85
aVIt was characterized by
p86
aVa nation-versus-nation,
p87
aVvery fragile standoff.
p88
aVAnd basically,
p89
aVwe lived for all those years,
p90
aVand some might argue that we still do,
p91
aVin a situation of
p92
aVbeing on the brink, literally,
p93
aVof an apocalyptic, planetary calamity.
p94
aVIt's incredible that we actually lived through all that.
p95
aa(lp96
VWe were totally dependent during those years
p97
aVon this amazing acronym, which is MAD.
p98
aVIt stands for mutually assured destruction.
p99
aVSo it meant
p100
aVif you attacked us, we would attack you
p101
aVvirtually simultaneously,
p102
aVand the end result would be a destruction
p103
aVof your country and mine.
p104
aVSo the threat of my own destruction
p105
aVkept me from launching
p106
aVa nuclear attack on you. That's the way we lived.
p107
aVAnd the danger of that, of course, is that
p108
aVa misreading of a radar screen
p109
aVcould actually cause a counter-launch,
p110
aVeven though the first country had not actually launched anything.
p111
aVDuring this chapter one,
p112
aVthere was a high level of public awareness
p113
aVabout the potential of nuclear catastrophe,
p114
aVand an indelible image was implanted
p115
aVin our collective minds
p116
aVthat, in fact, a nuclear holocaust
p117
aVwould be absolutely globally destructive
p118
aVand could, in some ways, mean the end of civilization as we know it.
p119
aVSo this was chapter one.
p120
aa(lp121
VNow the odd thing is that even though
p122
aVwe knew that there would be
p123
aVthat kind of civilization obliteration,
p124
aVwe engaged in America in a series \u2014
p125
aVand in fact, in the Soviet Union \u2014
p126
aVin a series of response planning.
p127
aVIt was absolutely incredible.
p128
aVSo premise one is we'd be destroying the world,
p129
aVand then premise two is, why don't we get prepared for it?
p130
aVSo what
p131
aVwe offered ourselves
p132
aVwas a collection of things. I'm just going to go skim through a few things,
p133
aVjust to jog your memories.
p134
aVIf you're born after 1950, this is just \u2014
p135
aVconsider this entertainment, otherwise it's memory lane.
p136
aa(lp137
VThis was Bert the Turtle. (Video)
p138
aVThis was basically an attempt
p139
aVto teach our schoolchildren
p140
aVthat if we did get engaged
p141
aVin a nuclear confrontation and atomic war,
p142
aVthen we wanted our school children
p143
aVto kind of basically duck and cover.
p144
aVThat was the principle. You \u2014
p145
aVthere would be a nuclear conflagration
p146
aVabout to hit us, and if you get under your desk,
p147
aVthings would be OK.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VI didn't do all that well
p152
aVin psychiatry in medical school, but I was interested,
p153
aVand I think this was seriously delusional.
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VSecondly, we told people
p158
aVto go down in their basements
p159
aVand build a fallout shelter.
p160
aVMaybe it would be a study when we weren't having an atomic war,
p161
aVor you could use it as a TV room, or, as many teenagers found out,
p162
aVa very, very safe place for a little privacy with your girlfriend.
p163
aVAnd actually \u2014 so there are multiple uses of the bomb shelters.
p164
aVOr you could buy a prefabricated bomb shelter
p165
aVthat you could simply bury in the ground.
p166
aVNow, the bomb shelters at that point \u2014
p167
aVlet's say you bought a prefab one \u2014 it would be a few hundred dollars,
p168
aVmaybe up to 500, if you got a fancy one.
p169
aVYet, what percentage of Americans
p170
aVdo you think ever had a bomb shelter in their house?
p171
aVWhat percentage lived in a house with a bomb shelter?
p172
aa(lp173
VLess than two percent. About 1.4 percent
p174
aVof the population, as far as anyone knows,
p175
aVdid anything,
p176
aVeither making a space in their basement
p177
aVor actually building a bomb shelter.
p178
aVMany buildings, public buildings, around the country \u2014
p179
aVthis is New York City \u2014 had these little civil defense signs,
p180
aVand the idea was that you would
p181
aVrun into one of these shelters and be safe
p182
aVfrom the nuclear weaponry.
p183
aVAnd one of the greatest governmental delusions
p184
aVof all time was something that happened
p185
aVin the early days of
p186
aVthe Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, as we now know,
p187
aVand are well aware of their behaviors from Katrina.
p188
aVHere is their first big public
p189
aVannouncement.
p190
aVThey would propose \u2014
p191
aVactually there were about six volumes written on this \u2014
p192
aVa crisis relocation plan
p193
aVthat was dependent upon
p194
aVthe United States having three to four days warning
p195
aVthat the Soviets were going to attack us.
p196
aVSo the goal was to evacuate the target cities.
p197
aVWe would move people out of the target cities
p198
aVinto the countryside.
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd I'm telling you, I actually testified at the Senate
p201
aVabout the absolute ludicrous idea
p202
aVthat we would actually evacuate,
p203
aVand actually have three or four days' warning.
p204
aVIt was just completely off the wall.
p205
aVTurns out that they had another idea
p206
aVbehind it, even though this was \u2014
p207
aVthey were telling the public it was to save us.
p208
aVThe idea was that we would force the Soviets
p209
aVto re-target their nuclear weapons \u2014 very expensive \u2014
p210
aVand potentially double their arsenal,
p211
aVto not only take out the original site,
p212
aVbut take out sites where people were going.
p213
aVThis was what apparently, as it turns out, was behind all this.
p214
aVIt was just really, really frightening.
p215
aa(lp216
VThe main point here is we were dealing with
p217
aVa complete disconnect from reality.
p218
aVThe civil defense programs were disconnected
p219
aVfrom the reality of what we'd see in all-out nuclear war.
p220
aVSo organizations like Physicians for Social Responsibility,
p221
aVaround 1979, started saying this a lot publicly.
p222
aVThey would do a bombing run. They'd go to your city,
p223
aVand they'd say, "Here's a map of your city.
p224
aVHere's what's going to happen if we get a nuclear hit."
p225
aVSo no possibility of medical response to,
p226
aVor meaningful preparedness for
p227
aVall-out nuclear war.
p228
aVSo we had to prevent nuclear war
p229
aVif we expected to survive.
p230
aVThis disconnect was never actually resolved.
p231
aVAnd what happened was \u2014
p232
aVwhen we get in to chapter two
p233
aVof the nuclear threat era,
p234
aVwhich started back in 1945.
p235
aa(lp236
VChapter two starts in 1991.
p237
aVWhen the Soviet Union broke up,
p238
aVwe effectively lost that adversary
p239
aVas a potential attacker of the United States, for the most part.
p240
aVIt's not completely gone. I'm going to come back to that.
p241
aVBut from 1991
p242
aVthrough the present time,
p243
aVemphasized by the attacks of 2001,
p244
aVthe idea of an all-out nuclear war
p245
aVhas diminished and the idea of a single event,
p246
aVact of nuclear terrorism
p247
aVis what we have instead.
p248
aVAlthough the scenario has changed
p249
aVvery considerably, the fact is
p250
aVthat we haven't changed our mental image
p251
aVof what a nuclear war means.
p252
aVSo I'm going to tell you what the implications of that are in just a second.
p253
aVSo, what is a nuclear terror threat?
p254
aVAnd there's four key ingredients to describing that.
p255
aa(lp256
VFirst thing is that the global nuclear weapons,
p257
aVin the stockpiles that I showed you in those original maps,
p258
aVhappen to be not uniformly secure.
p259
aVAnd it's particularly not secure
p260
aVin the former Soviet Union, now in Russia.
p261
aVThere are many, many sites where warheads are stored
p262
aVand, in fact, lots of sites where fissionable materials,
p263
aVlike highly enriched uranium and plutonium,
p264
aVare absolutely not safe.
p265
aVThey're available to be bought, stolen, whatever.
p266
aVThey're acquirable, let me put it that way.
p267
aVFrom 1993 through 2006,
p268
aVthe International Atomic Energy Agency
p269
aVdocumented 175 cases of nuclear theft,
p270
aV18 of which involved highly enriched uranium or plutonium,
p271
aVthe key ingredients to make a nuclear weapon.
p272
aVThe global stockpile of highly enriched uranium
p273
aVis about 1,300, at the low end,
p274
aVto about 2,100 metric tons.
p275
aVMore than 100 megatons of this
p276
aVis stored in particularly insecure
p277
aVRussian facilities.
p278
aVHow much of that do you think it would take
p279
aVto actually build a 10-kiloton bomb?
p280
aVWell, you need about 75 pounds of it.
p281
aa(lp282
VSo, what I'd like to show you
p283
aVis
p284
aVwhat it would take to hold 75 pounds
p285
aVof highly enriched uranium.
p286
aVThis is not a product placement. It's just \u2014
p287
aVin fact, if I was Coca Cola, I'd be pretty distressed about this \u2014
p288
aV(Laughter)
p289
aV\u2014 but
p290
aVbasically, this is it.
p291
aa(lp292
VThis is what you would need to steal or buy
p293
aVout of that 100-metric-ton stockpile
p294
aVthat's relatively insecure
p295
aVto create the type of bomb
p296
aVthat was used in Hiroshima.
p297
aVNow you might want to look at plutonium
p298
aVas another fissionable material that you might use in a bomb.
p299
aVThat \u2014 you'd need 10 to 13 pounds of plutonium.
p300
aVNow, plutonium, 10 to 13 pounds:
p301
aVthis. This is enough plutonium
p302
aVto create a Nagasaki-size atomic weapon.
p303
aVNow this situation, already I \u2014
p304
aVyou know, I don't really like thinking about this,
p305
aValthough somehow I got myself a job
p306
aVwhere I have to think about it. So
p307
aVthe point is that we're very, very insecure
p308
aVin terms of developing this material.
p309
aVThe second thing is, what about the know-how?
p310
aa(lp311
VAnd there's a lot of controversy about
p312
aVwhether terror organizations have the know-how
p313
aVto actually make a nuclear weapon.
p314
aVWell, there's a lot of know-how out there.
p315
aVThere's an unbelievable amount of know-how out there.
p316
aVThere's detailed information on how to assemble
p317
aVa nuclear weapon from parts.
p318
aVThere's books about how to build a nuclear bomb.
p319
aVThere are plans for how to create a terror farm
p320
aVwhere you could actually manufacture and develop
p321
aVall the components and assemble it.
p322
aVAll of this information is relatively available.
p323
aVIf you have an undergraduate degree in physics,
p324
aVI would suggest \u2014
p325
aValthough I don't, so maybe it's not even true \u2014
p326
aVbut something close to that would allow you,
p327
aVwith the information that's currently available,
p328
aVto actually build a nuclear weapon.
p329
aa(lp330
VThe third element of the nuclear terror threat
p331
aVis that, who would actually do such a thing?
p332
aVWell, what we're seeing now is a level of terrorism
p333
aVthat involves individuals who are highly organized.
p334
aVThey are very dedicated and committed.
p335
aVThey are stateless.
p336
aVSomebody once said, Al Qaeda
p337
aVdoes not have a return address,
p338
aVso if they attack us with a nuclear weapon,
p339
aVwhat's the response, and to whom is the response?
p340
aVAnd they're retaliation-proof.
p341
aVSince there is no real retribution possible
p342
aVthat would make any difference,
p343
aVsince there are people willing to actually give up their lives
p344
aVin order to do a lot of damage to us,
p345
aVit becomes apparent
p346
aVthat the whole notion
p347
aVof this mutually assured destruction would not work.
p348
aa(lp349
VHere is Sulaiman Abu Ghaith,
p350
aVand Sulaiman was a key lieutenant of Osama Bin Laden.
p351
aVHe wrote many, many times statements to this effect:
p352
aV"we have the right to kill four million Americans,
p353
aVtwo million of whom should be children."
p354
aVAnd we don't have to go overseas
p355
aVto find people willing to do harm, for whatever their reasons.
p356
aVMcVeigh and Nichols, and the Oklahoma City attack
p357
aVin the 1990s
p358
aVwas a good example of homegrown terrorists.
p359
aVWhat if they had gotten their hands on a nuclear weapon?
p360
aVThe fourth element
p361
aVis that the high-value U.S. targets
p362
aVare accessible, soft and plentiful.
p363
aa(lp364
VThis would be a talk for another day, but the level of the preparedness
p365
aVthat the United States has achieved
p366
aVsince 9/11 of '01
p367
aVis unbelievably inadequate.
p368
aVWhat you saw after Katrina
p369
aVis a very good indicator
p370
aVof how little prepared the United States is
p371
aVfor any kind of major attack.
p372
aVSeven million ship cargo containers
p373
aVcome into the United States every year.
p374
aVFive to seven percent only are inspected \u2014
p375
aVfive to seven percent.
p376
aa(lp377
VThis is Alexander Lebed,
p378
aVwho was a general that worked with Yeltsin,
p379
aVwho talked about, and presented to Congress,
p380
aVthis idea that the Russians had developed \u2014
p381
aVthese suitcase bombs. They were very low yield \u2014
p382
aV0.1 to one kiloton,
p383
aVHiroshima was around 13 kilotons \u2014
p384
aVbut enough to do an unbelievable amount of damage.
p385
aVAnd Lebed came to the United States
p386
aVand told us that many, many \u2014
p387
aVmore than 80 of the suitcase bombs
p388
aVwere actually not accountable.
p389
aVAnd they look like this. They're basically very simple arrangements.
p390
aVYou put the elements into a suitcase.
p391
aVIt becomes very portable.
p392
aVThe suitcase can be conveniently dropped
p393
aVin your trunk of your car.
p394
aVYou take it wherever you want to take it, and you can detonate it.
p395
aa(lp396
VYou don't want to build a suitcase bomb,
p397
aVand you happen to get one of those insecure
p398
aVnuclear warheads that exist.
p399
aVThis is the size of
p400
aVthe "Little Boy" bomb that was dropped at Hiroshima.
p401
aVIt was 9.8 feet long,
p402
aVweighed 8,800 pounds. You go down to
p403
aVyour local rent-a-truck
p404
aVand for 50 bucks or so,
p405
aVyou rent a truck that's got the right capacity,
p406
aVand you take your bomb,
p407
aVyou put it in the truck and you're ready to go.
p408
aVIt could happen. But what it would mean and who would survive?
p409
aVYou can't get an exact number for that kind of probability,
p410
aVbut what I'm trying to say is that
p411
aVwe have all the elements of that happening.
p412
aVAnybody who dismisses the thought
p413
aVof a nuclear weapon
p414
aVbeing used by a terrorist is kidding themselves.
p415
aa(lp416
VI think there's a lot of people in the intelligence community \u2014
p417
aVa lot of people who deal with this work in general
p418
aVthink it's almost inevitable, unless we do certain things
p419
aVto really try to defuse the risk,
p420
aVlike better interdiction, better prevention,
p421
aVbetter fixing, you know, better screening
p422
aVof cargo containers that are coming into the country and so forth.
p423
aVThere's a lot that can be done to make us a lot safer.
p424
aVAt this particular moment,
p425
aVwe actually could end up
p426
aVseeing a nuclear detonation in one of our cities.
p427
aVI don't think we would see an all-out nuclear war
p428
aVany time soon, although even that is not completely off the table.
p429
aVThere's still enough nuclear weapons
p430
aVin the arsenals of the superpowers
p431
aVto destroy the Earth many, many times over.
p432
aVThere are flash points in India and Pakistan,
p433
aVin the Middle East, in North Korea,
p434
aVother places where the use of nuclear weapons,
p435
aVwhile initially locally,
p436
aVcould very rapidly
p437
aVgo into a situation
p438
aVwhere we'd be facing all-out nuclear war.
p439
aVIt's very unsettling.
p440
aa(lp441
VHere we go. OK.
p442
aVI'm back in my truck, and we drove over the Brooklyn Bridge.
p443
aVWe're coming down,
p444
aVand we bring that truck
p445
aVthat you just saw
p446
aVsomewhere in here, in the Financial District.
p447
aVThis is a 10-kiloton bomb,
p448
aVslightly smaller than was used
p449
aVin Hiroshima. And I want to just conclude this
p450
aVby just giving you some information. I think \u2014
p451
aV"news you could use" kind of concept here.
p452
aVSo, first of all, this would be horrific
p453
aVbeyond anything we can possibly imagine.
p454
aVThis is the ultimate.
p455
aVAnd if you're in the half-mile radius
p456
aVof where this bomb went off,
p457
aVyou have a 90 percent chance of not making it.
p458
aVIf you're right where the bomb went off,
p459
aVyou will be vaporized. And that's \u2014
p460
aVI'm just telling you, this is not good.
p461
aa(lp462
V(Laughter)
p463
aa(lp464
VYou assume that.
p465
aVTwo-mile radius, you have a 50 percent chance
p466
aVof being killed,
p467
aVand up to about eight miles away \u2014
p468
aVnow I'm talking about killed instantly \u2014
p469
aVsomewhere between a 10 and 20 percent
p470
aVchance of getting killed.
p471
aVThe thing about this is that
p472
aVthe experience of the nuclear detonation is \u2014
p473
aVfirst of all, tens of millions of degrees Fahrenheit
p474
aVat the core here, where it goes off,
p475
aVand an extraordinary amount of energy
p476
aVin the form of heat, acute radiation
p477
aVand blast effects.
p478
aVAn enormous hurricane-like wind,
p479
aVand destruction of buildings almost totally,
p480
aVwithin this yellow circle here.
p481
aVAnd what I'm going to focus on, as I come to conclusion here,
p482
aVis that, what happens to you
p483
aVif you're in here?
p484
aVWell, if we're talking about the old days
p485
aVof an all-out nuclear attack,
p486
aVyou, up here,
p487
aVare as dead as the people here. So it was a moot point.
p488
aVMy point now, though, is that there is a lot
p489
aVthat we could do for you who are in here,
p490
aVif you've survived the initial blast.
p491
aVYou have, when the blast goes off \u2014
p492
aVand by the way, if it ever comes up, don't look at it.
p493
aa(lp494
V(Laughter)
p495
aa(lp496
VIf you look at it, you're going to be blind,
p497
aVeither temporarily or permanently.
p498
aVSo if there's any way that you can avoid,
p499
aVlike, avert your eyes, that would be a good thing.
p500
aVIf you find yourself alive, but
p501
aVyou're in the vicinity of a nuclear weapon,
p502
aVyou have \u2014 that's gone off \u2014
p503
aVyou have 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the size
p504
aVand exactly where it went off,
p505
aVto get out of the way before
p506
aVa lethal amount of radiation
p507
aVcomes straight down from the mushroom cloud that goes up.
p508
aVIn that 10 to 15 minutes, all you have to do \u2014
p509
aVand I mean this seriously \u2014
p510
aVis go about a mile
p511
aVaway from the blast.
p512
aVAnd what happens is \u2014 this is \u2014
p513
aVI'm going to show you now some fallout plumes. Within 20 minutes,
p514
aVit comes straight down. Within 24 hours,
p515
aVlethal radiation is going out with prevailing winds,
p516
aVand it's mostly in this particular direction \u2014
p517
aVit's going northeast.
p518
aa(lp519
VAnd if you're in this vicinity, you've got to get away.
p520
aVSo you're feeling the wind \u2014
p521
aVand there's tremendous wind now
p522
aVthat you're going to be feeling \u2014 and you want to go
p523
aVperpendicular to the wind
p524
aV[not upwind or downwind].
p525
aVif you are in fact able to see where the blast was in front of you.
p526
aVYou've got to get out of there.
p527
aVIf you don't get out of there, you're going to be exposed
p528
aVto lethal radiation in very short order.
p529
aVIf you can't get out of there,
p530
aVwe want you to go into a shelter and stay there.
p531
aVNow, in a shelter in an urban area means
p532
aVyou have to be either in a basement as deep as possible,
p533
aVor you have to be on a floor \u2014 on a high floor \u2014
p534
aVif it's a ground burst explosion, which it would be,
p535
aVhigher than the ninth floor. So you have to be tenth floor or higher,
p536
aVor in the basement.
p537
aVBut basically, you've got to get out of town as quickly as possible.
p538
aVAnd if you do that,
p539
aVyou actually can survive a nuclear blast.
p540
aa(lp541
VOver the next few days to a week,
p542
aVthere will be a radiation cloud,
p543
aVagain, going with the wind, and settling down
p544
aVfor another 15 or 20 miles out \u2014
p545
aVin this case, over Long Island.
p546
aVAnd if you're in the direct fallout zone here,
p547
aVyou really have to either be sheltered or you have to get out of there,
p548
aVand that's clear. But if you are sheltered,
p549
aVyou can actually survive.
p550
aVThe difference between knowing information
p551
aVof what you're going to do personally,
p552
aVand not knowing information, can save your life,
p553
aVand it could mean the difference between
p554
aV150,000 to 200,000 fatalities
p555
aVfrom something like this
p556
aVand half a million to 700,000 fatalities.
p557
aa(lp558
VSo, response planning in the twenty-first century
p559
aVis both possible and is essential.
p560
aVBut in 2008, there isn't one single American city
p561
aVthat has done effective plans
p562
aVto deal with a nuclear detonation disaster.
p563
aVPart of the problem is that
p564
aVthe emergency planners themselves, personally,
p565
aVare overwhelmed psychologically by the thought
p566
aVof nuclear catastrophe.
p567
aVThey are paralyzed.
p568
aVYou say "nuclear" to them, and they're thinking,
p569
aV"Oh my God, we're all gone. What's the point? It's futile."
p570
aVAnd we're trying to tell them, "It's not futile.
p571
aVWe can change the survival rates
p572
aVby doing some commonsensical things."
p573
aa(lp574
VSo the goal here is to minimize fatalities.
p575
aVAnd I just want to leave you with the personal points
p576
aVthat I think you might be interested in.
p577
aVThe key to surviving a nuclear blast
p578
aVis getting out,
p579
aVand not going into harm's way.
p580
aVThat's basically all we're going to be talking about here.
p581
aVAnd the farther you are away in distance,
p582
aVthe longer it is in time
p583
aVfrom the initial blast;
p584
aVand the more separation between you
p585
aVand the outside atmosphere, the better.
p586
aVSo separation \u2014 hopefully with dirt or concrete,
p587
aVor being in a basement \u2014
p588
aVdistance and time is what will save you.
p589
aa(lp590
VSo here's what you do. First of all,
p591
aVas I said, don't stare at the light flash,
p592
aVif you can. I don't know you could possibly resist doing that.
p593
aVBut let's assume, theoretically, you want to do that.
p594
aVYou want to keep your mouth open, so your eardrums
p595
aVdon't burst from the pressures.
p596
aVIf you're very close to what happened, you actually do have to duck and cover,
p597
aVlike Bert told you, Bert the Turtle.
p598
aVAnd you want to get under something so that you're not injured
p599
aVor killed by objects, if that's at all possible.
p600
aVYou want to get away from the initial fallout mushroom cloud,
p601
aVI said, in just a few minutes.
p602
aVAnd shelter and place. You want to move [only]
p603
aVcrosswind for 1.2 miles.
p604
aa(lp605
VYou know, if you're out there and you see buildings horribly destroyed
p606
aVand down in that direction,
p607
aVless destroyed here,
p608
aVthen you know that it was over there, the blast, and you're going this way,
p609
aVas long as you're going crosswise to the wind.
p610
aVOnce you're out and evacuating,
p611
aVyou want to keep as much of your skin,
p612
aVyour mouth and nose covered, as long as that covering
p613
aVdoesn't impede you moving and getting out of there.
p614
aVAnd finally, you want to get decontaminated as soon as possible.
p615
aVAnd if you're wearing clothing, you've taken off your clothing,
p616
aVyou're going to get showered down some place
p617
aVand remove the radiation that would be \u2014
p618
aVthe radioactive material that might be on you.
p619
aVAnd then you want to stay in shelter for 48 to 72 hours minimum,
p620
aVbut you're going to wait hopefully \u2014 you'll have your little wind-up,
p621
aVbattery-less radio,
p622
aVand you'll be waiting for people to tell you
p623
aVwhen it's safe to go outside. That's what you need to do.
p624
aa(lp625
VIn conclusion,
p626
aVnuclear war is less likely than before,
p627
aVbut by no means out of the question, and it's not survivable.
p628
aVNuclear terrorism is possible \u2014 it may be probable \u2014
p629
aVbut is survivable.
p630
aVAnd this is Jack Geiger, who's one of the heroes
p631
aVof the U.S. public health community.
p632
aVAnd Jack said the only way to deal
p633
aVwith nuclear anything,
p634
aVwhether it's war or terrorism,
p635
aVis abolition of nuclear weapons.
p636
aVAnd you want something to work on once you've fixed global warming,
p637
aVI urge you to think about the fact that
p638
aVwe have to do something about this
p639
aVunacceptable, inhumane
p640
aVreality of nuclear weapons
p641
aVin our world.
p642
aa(lp643
VNow, this is my favorite civil defense slide, and I \u2014
p644
aV(Laughter)
p645
aV\u2014 I don't want to be indelicate, but
p646
aVthis \u2014
p647
aVhe's no longer in office. We don't really care, OK.
p648
aVThis was sent to me by somebody
p649
aVwho is an aficionado of civil defense procedures,
p650
aVbut the fact of the matter is that
p651
aVAmerica's gone through a very hard time.
p652
aVWe've not been focused, we've not done what we had to do,
p653
aVand now we're facing the potential of
p654
aVbad, hell on Earth.
p655
aVThank you.

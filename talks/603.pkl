VInterestingly, Charles Darwin
p5
aVwas born a very lightly pigmented man,
p6
aVin a moderately-to-darkly pigmented world.
p7
aVOver the course of his life,
p8
aVDarwin had great privilege.
p9
aVHe lived in a fairly wealthy home.
p10
aVHe was raised by very supportive and interested parents.
p11
aVAnd when he was in his 20s
p12
aVhe embarked upon a remarkable voyage  on the ship the Beagle.
p13
aVAnd during the course of that voyage,
p14
aVhe saw remarkable things:
p15
aVtremendous diversity of plants and animals, and humans.
p16
aVAnd the observations that he made
p17
aVon that epic journey
p18
aVwere to be eventually distilled
p19
aVinto his wonderful book, "On the Origin of Species,"
p20
aVpublished 150 years ago.
p21
aa(lp22
VNow what is so interesting
p23
aVand to some, the extent, what's a bit infamous
p24
aVabout "The Origin of Species,"
p25
aVis that there is only one line in it
p26
aVabout human evolution.
p27
aV"Light will be thrown on the origin of man
p28
aVand his history."
p29
aVIt wasn't until much longer,
p30
aVmuch later,
p31
aVthat Darwin actually spoke
p32
aVand wrote about humans.
p33
aa(lp34
VNow in his years of
p35
aVtraveling on the Beagle,
p36
aVand from listening to the accounts
p37
aVor explorers and naturalists,
p38
aVhe knew that skin color
p39
aVwas one of the most important ways
p40
aVin which people varied.
p41
aVAnd he was somewhat interested in the pattern of skin color.
p42
aVHe knew that darkly pigmented peoples
p43
aVwere found close to the equator;
p44
aVlightly pigmented peoples, like himself,
p45
aVwere found closer to the poles.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo what did he make of all this?
p48
aVWell he didn't write anything about it in The Origin of Species.
p49
aVBut much later, in 1871,
p50
aVhe did have something to say about it.
p51
aVAnd it was quite curious. He said,
p52
aV"Of all the differences between the races of men,
p53
aVthe color of the skin is the most conspicuous
p54
aVand one of the best marked."
p55
aVAnd he went on to say,
p56
aV"These differences do not coincide
p57
aVwith corresponding differences in climate."
p58
aVSo he had traveled all around.
p59
aVHe had seen people of different colors
p60
aVliving in different places.
p61
aVAnd yet he rejected the idea
p62
aVthat human skin pigmentation
p63
aVwas related to the climate.
p64
aa(lp65
VIf only Darwin lived today.
p66
aVIf only Darwin had NASA.
p67
aVNow, one of the wonderful things that NASA does
p68
aVis it puts up a variety of satellites
p69
aVthat detect all sort of interesting things about our environment.
p70
aVAnd for many decades now
p71
aVthere have been a series of TOMS satellites
p72
aVthat have collected data about the radiation of the Earth's surface.
p73
aVThe TOMS 7 satellite data, shown here,
p74
aVshow the annual average
p75
aVultraviolet radiation at the Earth's surface.
p76
aVNow the really hot pink and red areas
p77
aVare those parts of the world that receive the highest amounts
p78
aVof UV during the year.
p79
aVThe incrementally cooler colors \u2014
p80
aVblues, greens, yellows, and finally grays \u2014
p81
aVindicate areas of much lower ultraviolet radiation.
p82
aa(lp83
VWhat's significant to the story of human skin pigmentation
p84
aVis just how much of the Northern Hemisphere
p85
aVis in these cool gray zones.
p86
aVThis has tremendous implications for our understanding
p87
aVof the evolution of human skin pigmentation.
p88
aVAnd what Darwin could not appreciate,
p89
aVor didn't perhaps want to appreciate at the time,
p90
aVis that there was a fundamental relationship
p91
aVbetween the intensity of ultraviolet radiation
p92
aVand skin pigmentation.
p93
aVAnd that skin pigmentation itself
p94
aVwas a product of evolution.
p95
aVAnd so when we look at a map of skin color,
p96
aVand predicted skin color, as we know it today,
p97
aVwhat we see is a beautiful gradient
p98
aVfrom the darkest skin pigmentations toward the equator,
p99
aVand the lightest ones toward the poles.
p100
aa(lp101
VWhat's very, very important here
p102
aVis that the earliest humans
p103
aVevolved in high-UV environments,
p104
aVin equatorial Africa.
p105
aVThe earliest members of our lineage,
p106
aVthe genus Homo, were darkly pigmented.
p107
aVAnd we all share this incredible heritage
p108
aVof having originally been
p109
aVdarkly pigmented,
p110
aVtwo million to one and half million years ago.
p111
aa(lp112
VNow what happened in our history?
p113
aVLet's first look at the relationship
p114
aVof ultraviolet radiation to the Earth's surface.
p115
aVIn those early days of our evolution,
p116
aVlooking at the equator,
p117
aVwe were bombarded by high levels of ultraviolet radiation.
p118
aVThe UVC, the most energetic type,
p119
aVwas occluded by the Earth's atmosphere.
p120
aVBut UVB and UVA
p121
aVespecially, came in unimpeded.
p122
aVUVB turns out to be incredibly important.
p123
aVIt's very destructive,
p124
aVbut it also catalyzes the production of vitamin D in the skin,
p125
aVvitamin D being a molecule that we very much need
p126
aVfor our strong bones, the health of our immune system,
p127
aVand myriad other important functions in our bodies.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo, living at the equator, we got
p130
aVlots and lots of ultraviolet radiation
p131
aVand the melanin \u2014
p132
aVthis wonderful, complex, ancient polymer
p133
aVcompound in our skin \u2014
p134
aVserved as a superb natural sunscreen.
p135
aVThis polymer is amazing
p136
aVbecause it's present in so many different organisms.
p137
aVMelanin, in various forms, has probably been on the Earth
p138
aVa billion years,
p139
aVand has been recruited over and over again
p140
aVby evolution, as often happens.
p141
aVWhy change it if it works?
p142
aa(lp143
VSo melanin was recruited, in our lineage,
p144
aVand specifically in our earliest ancestors
p145
aVevolving in Africa,
p146
aVto be a natural sunscreen.
p147
aVWhere it protected the body
p148
aVagainst the degradations of ultraviolet radiation,
p149
aVthe destruction, or damage to DNA,
p150
aVand the breakdown of a very important molecule called folate,
p151
aVwhich helps to fuel cell production,
p152
aVand reproduction in the body.
p153
aVSo, it's wonderful. We evolved this very protective,
p154
aVwonderful covering of melanin.
p155
aa(lp156
VBut then we moved.
p157
aVAnd humans dispersed \u2014 not once, but twice.
p158
aVMajor moves, outside of our equatorial homeland,
p159
aVfrom Africa into other parts of the Old World,
p160
aVand most recently, into the New World.
p161
aVWhen humans dispersed into these latitudes,
p162
aVwhat did they face?
p163
aVConditions were significantly colder,
p164
aVbut they were also less intense
p165
aVwith respect to the ultraviolet regime.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo if we're somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere,
p168
aVlook at what's happening to the ultraviolet radiation.
p169
aVWe're still getting a dose of UVA.
p170
aVBut all of the UVB,
p171
aVor nearly all of it,
p172
aVis dissipated through the thickness of the atmosphere.
p173
aVIn the winter, when you are skiing in the Alps,
p174
aVyou may experience ultraviolet radiation.
p175
aVBut it's all UVA,
p176
aVand, significantly, that UVA
p177
aVhas no ability to make vitamin D in your skin.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo people inhabiting northern hemispheric environments
p180
aVwere bereft of the potential
p181
aVto make vitamin D in their skin for most of the year.
p182
aVThis had tremendous consequences
p183
aVfor the evolution of human skin pigmentation.
p184
aVBecause what happened, in order to ensure health and well-being,
p185
aVthese lineages of people
p186
aVdispersing into the Northern Hemisphere
p187
aVlost their pigmentation.
p188
aVThere was natural selection
p189
aVfor the evolution of lightly pigmented skin.
p190
aa(lp191
VHere we begin to see the evolution
p192
aVof the beautiful sepia rainbow
p193
aVthat now characterizes all of humanity.
p194
aVLightly pigmented skin evolved not just once,
p195
aVnot just twice, but probably three times.
p196
aVNot just in modern humans,
p197
aVbut in one of our distant unrelated ancestors,
p198
aVthe Neanderthals.
p199
aVA remarkable, remarkable testament
p200
aVto the power of evolution.
p201
aVHumans have been on the move for a long time.
p202
aVAnd just in the last 5,000 years,
p203
aVin increasing rates, over increasing distances.
p204
aVHere are just some of the biggest movements of people,
p205
aVvoluntary movements, in the last 5,000 years.
p206
aa(lp207
VLook at some of the major latitudinal transgressions:
p208
aVpeople from high UV areas
p209
aVgoing to low UV and vice versa.
p210
aVAnd not all these moves were voluntary.
p211
aVBetween 1520 and 1867,
p212
aV12 million, 500 people
p213
aVwere moved from high UV
p214
aVto low UV areas
p215
aVin the transatlantic slave trade.
p216
aVNow this had all sorts of invidious social consequences.
p217
aVBut it also had deleterious
p218
aVhealth consequences to people.
p219
aa(lp220
VSo what? We've been on the move.
p221
aVWe're so clever we can overcome all of these
p222
aVseeming biological impediments.
p223
aVWell, often we're unaware
p224
aVof the fact that we're living
p225
aVin environments in which our skin
p226
aVis inherently poorly adapted.
p227
aVSome of us with lightly pigmented skin
p228
aVlive in high-UV areas.
p229
aVSome of us with darkly pigmented skin
p230
aVlive in low-UV areas.
p231
aVThese have tremendous consequences for our health.
p232
aa(lp233
VWe have to, if we're lightly pigmented,
p234
aVbe careful about the problems of skin cancer,
p235
aVand destruction of folate in our bodies,
p236
aVby lots of sun.
p237
aVEpidemiologists and doctors
p238
aVhave been very good about telling us
p239
aVabout protecting our skin.
p240
aVWhat they haven't been so good about instructing people
p241
aVis the problem of darkly pigmented people
p242
aVliving in high latitude areas,
p243
aVor working inside all the time.
p244
aa(lp245
VBecause the problem there is just as severe,
p246
aVbut it is more sinister,
p247
aVbecause vitamin D deficiency,
p248
aVfrom a lack of ultraviolet B radiation,
p249
aVis a major problem.
p250
aVVitamin D deficiency creeps up on people,
p251
aVand causes all sorts of health problems to their bones,
p252
aVto their gradual decay of their immune systems,
p253
aVor loss of immune function,
p254
aVand probably some problems
p255
aVwith their mood and health,
p256
aVtheir mental health.
p257
aa(lp258
VSo we have, in skin pigmentation,
p259
aVone of these wonderful products of evolution
p260
aVthat still has consequences for us today.
p261
aVAnd the social consequences,
p262
aVas we know, are incredibly profound.
p263
aVWe live in a world where we
p264
aVhave lightly and darkly pigmented people
p265
aVliving next to one another,
p266
aVbut often brought into proximity initially
p267
aVas a result of very invidious social interactions.
p268
aVSo how can we overcome this?
p269
aVHow can we begin to understand it?
p270
aVEvolution helps us.
p271
aa(lp272
V200 years after Darwin's birthday,
p273
aVwe have the first moderately pigmented President of the United States.
p274
aV(Applause)
p275
aVHow wonderful is that?
p276
aV(Applause)
p277
aVThis man is significant for a whole host of reasons.
p278
aVBut we need to think about how he compares,
p279
aVin terms of his pigmentation, to other people on Earth.
p280
aVHe, as one of many urban admixed populations,
p281
aVis very emblematic
p282
aVof a mixed parentage, of a mixed pigmentation.
p283
aVAnd he resembles, very closely,
p284
aVpeople with moderate levels of pigmentation
p285
aVwho live in southern Africa, or Southeast Asia.
p286
aa(lp287
VThese people have a tremendous potential
p288
aVto tan, to develop more pigment in their skin,
p289
aVas a result of exposure to sun.
p290
aVThey also run the risk of vitamin D deficiency,
p291
aVif they have desk jobs, like that guy.
p292
aVSo lets all wish for his great health,
p293
aVand his awareness of his own skin pigmentation.
p294
aa(lp295
VNow what is wonderful
p296
aVabout the evolution of human skin pigmentation,
p297
aVand the phenomenon of pigmentation,
p298
aVis that it is the demonstration,
p299
aVthe evidence, of evolution
p300
aVby natural selection,
p301
aVright on your body.
p302
aVWhen people ask you, "What is the evidence for evolution?"
p303
aVYou don't have to think about some exotic examples, or fossils.
p304
aVYou just have to look at your skin.
p305
aa(lp306
VDarwin, I think, would have appreciated this,
p307
aVeven though he eschewed the importance
p308
aVof climate on the evolution of pigmentation during his own life.
p309
aVI think, were he able to look
p310
aVat the evidence we have today, he would understand it.
p311
aVHe would appreciate it.
p312
aVAnd most of all, he would teach it.
p313
aa(lp314
VYou, you can teach it.
p315
aVYou can touch it.
p316
aVYou can understand it.
p317
aVTake it out of this room.
p318
aVTake your skin color,
p319
aVand celebrate it.
p320
aVSpread the word.
p321
aVYou have the evolution
p322
aVof the history of our species,
p323
aVpart of it, written in your skin.
p324
aVUnderstand it. Appreciate it. Celebrate it.
p325
aVGo out. Isn't it beautiful? Isn't it wonderful?
p326
aVYou are the products of evolution.
p327
aVThank you.
p328

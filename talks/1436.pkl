VI don't know why, but I'm continually amazed to think
p5
aVthat two and a half billion of us around the world
p6
aVare connected to each other through the Internet
p7
aVand that at any point in time
p8
aVmore than 30 percent of the world's population
p9
aVcan go online to learn, to create and to share.
p10
aVAnd the amount of time each of us is spending doing all of this
p11
aVis also continuing to go grow.
p12
aVA recent study showed
p13
aVthat the young generation alone
p14
aVis spending over eight hours a day online.
p15
aVAs the parent of a nine-year-old girl,
p16
aVthat number seems awfully low.
p17
aV(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VBut just as the Internet has opened up the world for each and every one of us,
p20
aVit has also opened up each and every one of us to the world.
p21
aVAnd increasingly, the price we're being asked to pay
p22
aVfor all of this connectedness
p23
aVis our privacy.
p24
aVToday, what many of us would love to believe
p25
aVis that the Internet is a private place; it's not.
p26
aVAnd with every click of the mouse and every touch of the screen,
p27
aVwe are like Hansel and Gretel
p28
aVleaving breadcrumbs of our personal information
p29
aVeverywhere we travel through the digital woods.
p30
aVWe are leaving our birthdays, our places of residence,
p31
aVour interests and preferences,
p32
aVour relationships,
p33
aVour financial histories, and on and on it goes.
p34
aa(lp35
VNow don't get me wrong,
p36
aVI'm not for one minute suggesting that sharing data is a bad thing.
p37
aVIn fact, when I know the data that's being shared
p38
aVand I'm asked explicitly for my consent,
p39
aVI want some sites to understand my habits.
p40
aVIt helps them suggest books for me to read
p41
aVor movies for my family to watch
p42
aVor friends for us to connect with.
p43
aVBut when I don't know and when I haven't been asked,
p44
aVthat's when the problem arises.
p45
aVIt's a phenomenon on the Internet today
p46
aVcalled behavioral tracking,
p47
aVand it is very big business.
p48
aa(lp49
VIn fact, there's an entire industry formed
p50
aVaround following us through the digital woods
p51
aVand compiling a profile on each of us.
p52
aVAnd when all of that data is held,
p53
aVthey can do almost whatever they want with it.
p54
aVThis is an area today that has very few regulations
p55
aVand even fewer rules.
p56
aVExcept for some of the recent announcements here in the United States and in Europe,
p57
aVit's an area of consumer protection that's almost entirely naked.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo let me expose this lurking industry a little bit further.
p60
aVThe visualization you see forming behind me is called Collusion
p61
aVand it's an experimental browser add-on
p62
aVthat you can install in your Firefox browser
p63
aVthat helps you see where your Web data is going and who's tracking you.
p64
aVThe red dots you see up there
p65
aVare sites that are behavioral tracking
p66
aVthat I have not navigated to, but are following me.
p67
aVThe blue dots are the sites that I've actually navigated directly to.
p68
aVAnd the gray dots are sites that are also tracking me,
p69
aVbut I have no idea who they are.
p70
aVAll of them are connected, as you can see,
p71
aVto form a picture of me on the Web.
p72
aVAnd this is my profile.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo let me go from an example to something very specific and personal.
p75
aVI installed Collusion in my own laptop two weeks ago
p76
aVand I let it follow me around for what was a pretty typical day.
p77
aVNow like most of you,
p78
aVI actually start my day going online and checking email.
p79
aVI then go to a news site, look for some headlines.
p80
aVAnd in this particular case I happened to like one of them
p81
aVon the merits of music literacy in schools
p82
aVand I shared it over a social network.
p83
aa(lp84
VOur daughter then joined us at the breakfast table,
p85
aVand I asked her, "Is there an emphasis on music literacy in your school?"
p86
aVAnd she, of course, naturally as a nine-year-old,
p87
aVlooked at me and said quizzically, "What's literacy?"
p88
aVSo I sent her online, of course, to look it up.
p89
aVNow let me stop here.
p90
aVWe are not even two bites into breakfast
p91
aVand there are already nearly 25 sites that are tracking me.
p92
aVI have navigated to a total of four.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo let me fast-forward through the rest of my day.
p95
aVI go to work, I check email,
p96
aVI log onto a few more social sites, I blog,
p97
aVI check more news reports, I share some of those news reports,
p98
aVI go look at some videos,
p99
aVpretty typical day \u2014 in this case, actually fairly pedantic \u2014
p100
aVand at the end of the day, as my day winds down,
p101
aVlook at my profile.
p102
aVThe red dots have exploded.
p103
aVThe gray dots have grown exponentially.
p104
aVAll in all, there's over 150 sites
p105
aVthat are now tracking my personal information,
p106
aVmost all of them without my consent.
p107
aa(lp108
VI look at this picture and it freaks me out.
p109
aVThis is nothing. I am being stalked across the Web.
p110
aVAnd why is this happening?
p111
aVPretty simple \u2014 it's huge business.
p112
aVThe revenue of the top handful of companies in this space
p113
aVis over 39 billion dollars today.
p114
aVAnd as adults, we're certainly not alone.
p115
aVAt the same time I installed my own Collusion profile,
p116
aVI installed one for my daughter.
p117
aVAnd on one single Saturday morning, over two hours on the Internet,
p118
aVhere's her Collusion profile.
p119
aa(lp120
VThis is a nine-year-old girl
p121
aVnavigating to principally children's sites.
p122
aVI move from this, from freaked out to enraged.
p123
aVThis is no longer me being a tech pioneer or a privacy advocate;
p124
aVthis is me being a parent.
p125
aVImagine in the physical world
p126
aVif somebody followed our children around with a camera and a notebook
p127
aVand recorded their every movement.
p128
aVI can tell you, there isn't a person in this room that would sit idly by.
p129
aVWe'd take action. It may not be good action, but we would take action.
p130
aV(Laughter)
p131
aVWe can't sit idly by here either.
p132
aVThis is happening today.
p133
aa(lp134
VPrivacy is not an option,
p135
aVand it shouldn't be the price we accept
p136
aVfor just getting on the Internet.
p137
aVOur voices matter and our actions matter even more.
p138
aa(lp139
VToday we've launched Collusion.
p140
aVYou can download it, install it in Firefox,
p141
aVto see who is tracking you across the Web
p142
aVand following you through the digital woods.
p143
aVGoing forward, all of our voices need to be heard.
p144
aVBecause what we don't know can actually hurt us.
p145
aVBecause the memory of the Internet is forever.
p146
aVWe are being watched.
p147
aVIt's now time for us to watch the watchers.
p148
aa(lp149
VThank you.

VI am no designer, nope, no way.
p5
aVMy dad was,
p6
aVwhich is kind of an interesting way to grow up.
p7
aVI had to figure out what it is my dad did
p8
aVand why it was important.
p9
aa(lp10
VDad talked a lot about bad design when we were growing up,
p11
aVyou know, "Bad design is just people not thinking, John," he would say
p12
aVwhenever a kid would be injured by a rotary lawn mower
p13
aVor, say, a typewriter ribbon would get tangled
p14
aVor an eggbeater would get jammed in the kitchen.
p15
aa(lp16
VYou know, "Design \u2014 bad design, there's just no excuse for it.
p17
aVIt's letting stuff happen without thinking about it.
p18
aVEvery object should be about something, John.
p19
aVIt should imagine a user.
p20
aVIt should cast that user in a story starring the user and the object.
p21
aa(lp22
VGood design," my dad said, "is about supplying intent."
p23
aVThat's what he said.
p24
aa(lp25
VDad helped design the control panels for the IBM 360 computer.
p26
aVThat was a big deal; that was important. He worked for Kodak for a while; that was important.
p27
aVHe designed chairs and desks and other office equipment for Steelcase; that was important.
p28
aVI knew design was important in my house because, for heaven's sake, it put food on our table, right?
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd design was in everything my dad did.
p31
aVHe had a Dixieland jazz band when we were growing up,
p32
aVand he would always cover Louis Armstrong tunes.
p33
aVAnd I would ask him every once in a while,
p34
aa(lp35
V"Dad, do you want it to sound like the record?"
p36
aVWe had lots of old jazz records lying around the house.
p37
aVAnd he said, "No, never, John, never.
p38
aVThe song is just a given, that's how you have to think about it.
p39
aVYou gotta make it your own. You gotta design it.
p40
aVShow everyone what you intend," is what he said.
p41
aV"Doing that, acting by design, is what we all should be doing.
p42
aVIt's where we all belong."
p43
aa(lp44
VAll of us? Designers?
p45
aVOh, oh, Dad. Oh, Dad.
p46
aa(lp47
VThe song is just a given.
p48
aVIt's how you cover it that matters.
p49
aVWell, let's hold on to that thought for just a minute.
p50
aVIt's kind of like this wheelchair I'm in, right?
p51
aVThe original tune? It's a little scary.
p52
aa(lp53
V"Ooh, what happened to that dude?
p54
aVHe can't walk. Anybody know the story?
p55
aVAnybody?"
p56
aa(lp57
VI don't like to talk about this very much, but I'll tell you guys the story today.
p58
aVAll right, exactly 36 years ago this week, that's right,
p59
aVI was in a poorly designed automobile
p60
aVthat hit a poorly designed guardrail
p61
aVon a poorly designed road in Pennsylvania,
p62
aVand plummeted down a 200-foot embankment
p63
aVand killed two people in the car.
p64
aVBut ever since then, the wheelchair has been a given in my life.
p65
aVMy life, at the mercy of good design and bad design.
p66
aa(lp67
VThink about it. Now, in design terms,
p68
aVa wheelchair is a very difficult object.
p69
aVIt mostly projects tragedy and fear and misfortune,
p70
aVand it projects that message, that story, so strongly
p71
aVthat it almost blots out anything else.
p72
aa(lp73
VI roll swiftly through an airport, right?
p74
aVAnd moms grab their kids out of the way and say, "Don't stare!"
p75
aVThe poor kid, you know, has this terrified look on his face, God knows what they think.
p76
aVAnd for decades, I'm going,
p77
aVwhy does this happen? What can I do about it? How can I change this? I mean there must be something.
p78
aVSo I would roll, I'd make no eye contact \u2014 just kinda frown, right?
p79
aVOr I'd dress up really, really sharply or something.
p80
aVOr I'd make eye contact with everyone \u2014
p81
aVthat was really creepy; that didn't work at all.
p82
aV(Laughter)
p83
aVYou know anything, I'd try. I wouldn't shower for a week \u2014 nothing worked.
p84
aa(lp85
VNothing whatsoever worked until a few years ago,
p86
aVmy six-year-old daughters were looking at this wheelchair catalog that I had, and they said,
p87
aa(lp88
V"Oh, Dad! Dad! Look, you gotta get these, these flashy wheels \u2014 you gotta get 'em!"
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd I said, "Oh, girls, Dad is a very important journalist,
p91
aVthat just wouldn't do at all."
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd of course, they immediately concluded,
p94
aa(lp95
V"Oh, what a bummer, Dad. Journalists aren't allowed to have flashy wheels.
p96
aVI mean, how important could you be then?" they said.
p97
aa(lp98
VI went, "Wait a minute, all right, right \u2014 I'll get the wheels." Purely out of protest,
p99
aa(lp100
VI got the flashy wheels, and I installed them and \u2014
p101
aVcheck this out. Could I have my special light cue please?
p102
aV(Laughter)
p103
aVLook at that!
p104
aVNow ... look at, look at this! Look at this!
p105
aa(lp106
VSo what you are looking at here
p107
aVhas completely changed my life,
p108
aVI mean totally changed my life.
p109
aVInstead of blank stares and awkwardness,
p110
aVnow it is pointing and smiling!
p111
aa(lp112
VPeople going, "Awesome wheels, dude! Those are awesome!
p113
aVI mean, I want some of those wheels!" Little kids say,
p114
aV"Can I have a ride?"
p115
aV(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd of course there's the occasional person \u2014
p118
aVusually a middle-aged male who will say,
p119
aV"Oh, those wheels are great!
p120
aVI guess they're for safety, right?"
p121
aV(Laughter)
p122
aVNo! They're not for safety.
p123
aVNo, no, no, no, no.
p124
aa(lp125
VWhat's the difference here,
p126
aVthe wheelchair with no lights
p127
aVand the wheelchair with lights?
p128
aVThe difference is intent.
p129
aVThat's right, that's right; I'm no longer a victim.
p130
aVI chose to change the situation \u2014 I'm the Commander of the Starship Wheelchair with the phaser wheels in the front. Right?
p131
aVIntent changes the picture completely.
p132
aVI choose to enhance
p133
aVthis rolling experience
p134
aVwith a simple design element.
p135
aVActing with intent.
p136
aVIt conveys authorship.
p137
aVIt suggests that someone is driving.
p138
aVIt's reassuring; people are drawn to it.
p139
aVSomeone making the experience their own.
p140
aVCovering the tragic tune
p141
aVwith something different,
p142
aVsomething radically different.
p143
aVPeople respond to that.
p144
aa(lp145
VNow it seems simple, but actually I think
p146
aVin our society and culture in general,
p147
aVwe have a huge problem with intent.
p148
aVNow go with me here. Look at this guy. You know who this is?
p149
aVIt's Anders Breivik. Now, if he intended to kill
p150
aVin Olso, Norway last year,
p151
aVdozens and dozens of young people \u2014
p152
aVif he intended to do that,
p153
aVhe's a vicious criminal. We punish him.
p154
aVLife in prison. Death penalty in the United States, not so much in Norway.
p155
aVBut, if he instead acted out of a delusional fantasy,
p156
aVif he was motivated by some random mental illness,
p157
aVhe's in a completely different category.
p158
aVWe may put him away for life, but
p159
aVwe watch him clinically.
p160
aVIt's a completely different domain.
p161
aVAs an intentional murderer,
p162
aVAnders Breivik is merely evil.
p163
aVBut as a dysfunctional,
p164
aVas a dysfunctional murderer/psychotic,
p165
aVhe's something much more complicated.
p166
aVHe's the breath of some
p167
aVprimitive, ancient chaos.
p168
aVHe's the random state of nature
p169
aVwe emerged from.
p170
aVHe's something very, very different.
p171
aa(lp172
VIt's as though intent is an essential component for humanity.
p173
aVIt's what we're supposed to do somehow.
p174
aVWe're supposed to act with intent.
p175
aVWe're supposed to do things by design.
p176
aVIntent is a marker for civilization.
p177
aa(lp178
VNow here's an example a little closer to home:
p179
aVMy family is all about intent.
p180
aVYou can probably tell there are two sets of twins,
p181
aVthe result of IVF technology, in vitro fertilization technology,
p182
aVdue to some physical limitations I won't go into.
p183
aVAnyway, in vitro technology, IVF,
p184
aVis about as intentional as agriculture.
p185
aVLet me tell you, some of you may have the experience.
p186
aVIn fact, the whole technology of sperm extraction
p187
aVfor spinal cord-injured males was invented by a veterinarian.
p188
aVI met the dude. He's a great guy.
p189
aVHe carried this big leather bag full of sperm probes for
p190
aVall of the animals that he'd worked with,
p191
aVall the different animals.
p192
aVProbes he designed,
p193
aVand in fact, he was really, really proud of these probes.
p194
aa(lp195
VHe would say, "You're right between horse and squirrel, John."
p196
aV(Laughter)
p197
aVBut anyway, so when my wife and I decided
p198
aVto upgrade our early middle age \u2014 we had four kids, after all \u2014
p199
aVwith a little different technology
p200
aVthat I won't explain in too much detail here \u2014
p201
aVmy urologist assured me I had nothing whatsoever to worry about.
p202
aa(lp203
V"No need for birth control, Doc, are you sure about that?"
p204
aa(lp205
V"John, John, I looked at your chart.
p206
aVFrom your sperm tests we can
p207
aVconfidently say that
p208
aVyou're basically a form of birth control."
p209
aa(lp210
VWell!
p211
aV(Laughter)
p212
aVWhat a liberating thought! Yes!
p213
aVAnd after a couple very liberating weekends,
p214
aVmy wife and I,
p215
aVutilizing some cutting-edge erectile technology
p216
aVthat is certainly worthy of a TEDTalk someday
p217
aVbut I won't get into it now,
p218
aVwe noticed some familiar, if unexpected, symptoms.
p219
aVI wasn't exactly a form of birth control.
p220
aVLook at that font there. My wife was so pissed.
p221
aa(lp222
VI mean, did a designer come up with that?
p223
aVNo, I don't think a designer did come up with that.
p224
aVIn fact, maybe that's the problem.
p225
aVAnd so, little Ajax was born.
p226
aVHe's like our other children,
p227
aVbut the experience is completely different.
p228
aVIt's something like my accident, right?
p229
aVHe came out of nowhere.
p230
aVBut we all had to change,
p231
aVbut not just react to the given;
p232
aVwe bend to this new experience with intent.
p233
aVWe're five now. Five.
p234
aVFacing the given with intent. Doing things by design.
p235
aVHey, the name Ajax \u2014 you can't get much more intentional than that, right?
p236
aVWe're really hoping he thanks us for that later on.
p237
aV(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
VBut I never became a designer. No, no, no, no. Never attempted. Never even close.
p240
aVI did love some great designs as I was growing up:
p241
aVThe HP 35S calculator \u2014 God, I loved that thing. Oh God, I wish I had one.
p242
aVMan, I love that thing.
p243
aVI could afford that.
p244
aVOther designs I really couldn't afford, like the 1974 911 Targa.
p245
aVIn school, I studied nothing close to design or engineering;
p246
aVI studied useless things like the Classics,
p247
aVbut there were some lessons even there \u2014
p248
aVthis guy, Plato, it turns out he's a designer.
p249
aVHe designed a state in "The Republic,"
p250
aVa design never implemented.
p251
aVListen to one of the design features
p252
aVof Plato's Government 4.0:
p253
aa(lp254
V"The State in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern
p255
aVis always the best and most quietly governed,
p256
aVand the State in which they are most eager, the worst."
p257
aa(lp258
VWell, got that wrong, didn't we?
p259
aVBut look at that statement; it's all about intent. That's what I love about it.
p260
aVBut consider what Plato is doing here. What is he doing?
p261
aVIt's a grand idea of design \u2014 a huge idea of design,
p262
aVcommon to all of the voices of religion and philosophy
p263
aVthat emerged in the Classical period.
p264
aVWhat was going on then?
p265
aVThey were trying to answer the question of
p266
aVwhat would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive?
p267
aVAs the human race emerged from a prehistoric chaos,
p268
aVa confrontation with random, brutal nature,
p269
aVthey suddenly had a moment to think \u2014 and there was a lot to think about.
p270
aVAll of a sudden, human existence needed an intent.
p271
aVHuman life needed a reason.
p272
aVReality itself needed a designer.
p273
aVThe given was replaced
p274
aVby various aspects of intent,
p275
aVby various designs,
p276
aVby various gods.
p277
aVGods we're still fighting about. Oh yeah.
p278
aa(lp279
VToday we don't confront the chaos of nature.
p280
aVToday it is the chaos of humanity's impact on the Earth itself that we confront.
p281
aVThis young discipline called design, I think,
p282
aVis in fact the emerging ethos
p283
aVformulating and then answering a very new question:
p284
aVWhat shall we do now
p285
aVin the face of the chaos that we have created?
p286
aVWhat shall we do?
p287
aVHow shall we inscribe intent
p288
aVon all the objects we create,
p289
aVon all the circumstances we create,
p290
aVon all the places we change?
p291
aVThe consequences of a planet with 7 billion people and counting.
p292
aVThat's the tune we're all covering today, all of us.
p293
aVAnd we can't just imitate the past. No.
p294
aVThat won't do.
p295
aVThat won't do at all.
p296
aa(lp297
VHere's my favorite design moment:
p298
aVIn the city of Kinshasa in Zaire in the 1990s,
p299
aVI was working for ABC News, and I was reporting on
p300
aVthe fall of Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator, the brutal dictator in Zaire,
p301
aVwho raped and pillaged that country.
p302
aVThere was rioting in the middle of Kinshasa.
p303
aVThe place was falling apart; it was a horrible, horrible place,
p304
aVand I needed to go and explore the center of Kinshasa
p305
aVto report on the rioting and the looting.
p306
aVPeople were carrying off vehicles, carrying off pieces of buildings.
p307
aVSoldiers were in the streets shooting at looters and herding some in mass arrests.
p308
aVIn the middle of this chaos, I'm rolling around in a wheelchair,
p309
aVand I was completely invisible. Completely.
p310
aVI was in a wheelchair; I didn't look like a looter.
p311
aVI was in a wheelchair; I didn't look like a journalist, particularly, at least from their perspective.
p312
aVAnd I didn't look like a soldier, that's for sure.
p313
aVI was part of this sort of background noise of the misery of Zaire, completely invisible.
p314
aVAnd all of a sudden, from around a corner, comes this young man, paralyzed, just like me,
p315
aVin this metal and wood and leather
p316
aVpedal, three-wheel tricycle-wheelchair device,
p317
aVand he pedals up to me as fast as he can.
p318
aa(lp319
VHe goes, "Hey, mister! Mister!"
p320
aa(lp321
VAnd I looked at him \u2014
p322
aVhe didn't know any other English than that, but we didn't need English, no, no, no, no, no.
p323
aVWe sat there and compared wheels and tires and spokes and tubes.
p324
aVAnd I looked at his whacky pedal mechanism;
p325
aVhe was full of pride over his design.
p326
aVI wish I could show you that contraption.
p327
aVHis smile, our glow
p328
aVas we talked a universal language
p329
aVof design,
p330
aVinvisible to the chaos around us.
p331
aVHis machine: homemade, bolted, rusty, comical.
p332
aVMy machine: American-made, confident, sleek.
p333
aVHe was particularly proud of the comfortable seat, really comfortable seat
p334
aVhe had made in his chariot
p335
aVand its beautiful fabric fringe around the edge.
p336
aVOh, I wish I'd had those sparkly wheels back then to have shown him, man!
p337
aVHe would have loved those! Oh yeah.
p338
aVHe would have understood those;
p339
aVa chariot of pure intent \u2014 think about it \u2014
p340
aVin a city out of control.
p341
aVDesign blew it all away for a moment.
p342
aVWe spoke for a few minutes and then each of us vanished back into the chaos.
p343
aVHe went back to the streets of Kinshasa;
p344
aVI went to my hotel. And I think of him now, now ...
p345
aa(lp346
VAnd I pose this question.
p347
aVAn object imbued with intent \u2014
p348
aVit has power,
p349
aVit's treasure, we're drawn to it.
p350
aVAn object devoid of intent \u2014
p351
aVit's random, it's imitative,
p352
aVit repels us. It's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away.
p353
aVThis is what we must demand of our lives,
p354
aVof our objects, of our things, of our circumstances:
p355
aVliving with intent.
p356
aVAnd I have to say
p357
aVthat on that score, I have a very unfair advantage over all of you.
p358
aa(lp359
VAnd I want to explain it to you now because this is a very special day.
p360
aVThirty-six years ago at nearly this moment,
p361
aVa 19-year-old boy awoke from a coma
p362
aVto ask a nurse a question,
p363
aVbut the nurse was already there with an answer.
p364
aa(lp365
V"You've had a terrible accident, young man. You've broken your back.
p366
aVYou'll never walk again."
p367
aa(lp368
VI said, "I know all that \u2014 what day is it?"
p369
aVYou see, I knew that the car had gone over the guardrail on the 28th of February,
p370
aVand I knew that 1976 was a leap year.
p371
aa(lp372
V"Nurse! Is this the 28th or the 29th?"
p373
aa(lp374
VAnd she looked at me and said,
p375
aV"It's March 1st."
p376
aa(lp377
VAnd I went, "Oh my God.
p378
aVI've got some catching up to do!"
p379
aVAnd from that moment, I knew
p380
aVthe given was that accident;
p381
aVI had no option but to make up
p382
aVthis new life without walking.
p383
aVIntent \u2014 a life with intent \u2014
p384
aVlived by design,
p385
aVcovering the original
p386
aVwith something better.
p387
aVIt's something for all of us to do or find a way to do in these times.
p388
aa(lp389
VTo get back to this,
p390
aVto get back to design,
p391
aVand as my daddy suggested a long time ago,
p392
aa(lp393
V"Make the song your own, John.
p394
aVShow everybody what you intend."
p395
aa(lp396
VDaddy,
p397
aVthis one's for you.
p398
aV(Music)

V\u266b Jo Jo was a man who thought he was a loner \u266b
p401
aV\u266b but he was another man. \u266b

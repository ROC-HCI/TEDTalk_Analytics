VWhen I was 10 years old,
p5
aVa cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school.
p6
aVAnd as a special treat,
p7
aVhe took me to the pathology lab
p8
aVand took a real human brain
p9
aVout of the jar
p10
aVand placed it in my hands.
p11
aVAnd there it was,
p12
aVthe seat of human consciousness,
p13
aVthe powerhouse of the human body,
p14
aVsitting in my hands.
p15
aVAnd that day I knew that when I grew up,
p16
aVI was going to become a brain doctor,
p17
aVscientist, something or the other.
p18
aa(lp19
VYears later, when I finally grew up,
p20
aVmy dream came true.
p21
aVAnd it was while I was doing my Ph.D.
p22
aVon the neurological causes
p23
aVof dyslexia in children
p24
aVthat I encountered a startling fact
p25
aVthat I'd like to share with you all today.
p26
aVIt is estimated that one in six children,
p27
aVthat's one in six children,
p28
aVsuffer from some developmental disorder.
p29
aVThis is a disorder that
p30
aVretards mental development in the child
p31
aVand causes permanent mental impairments.
p32
aVWhich means that each and every one of you here today
p33
aVknows at least one child that is suffering
p34
aVfrom a developmental disorder.
p35
aa(lp36
VBut here's what really perplexed me.
p37
aVDespite the fact that each
p38
aVand every one of these disorders
p39
aVoriginates in the brain,
p40
aVmost of these disorders
p41
aVare diagnosed solely on the basis
p42
aVof observable behavior.
p43
aVBut diagnosing a brain disorder
p44
aVwithout actually looking at the brain
p45
aVis analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem
p46
aVbased on their physical symptoms,
p47
aVwithout even doing an ECG or a chest X-ray
p48
aVto look at the heart.
p49
aVIt seemed so intuitive to me.
p50
aVTo diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately,
p51
aVit would be necessary to look at the brain directly.
p52
aVLooking at behavior alone
p53
aVcan miss a vital piece of the puzzle
p54
aVand provide an incomplete, or even a misleading,
p55
aVpicture of the child's problems.
p56
aVYet, despite all the advances in medical technology,
p57
aVthe diagnosis of brain disorders
p58
aVin one in six children
p59
aVstill remained so limited.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd then I came across a team at Harvard University
p62
aVthat had taken one such advanced medical technology
p63
aVand finally applied it,
p64
aVinstead of in brain research,
p65
aVtowards diagnosing brain disorders in children.
p66
aVTheir groundbreaking technology
p67
aVrecords the EEG, or the electrical activity
p68
aVof the brain, in real time,
p69
aVallowing us to watch the brain
p70
aVas it performs various functions
p71
aVand then detect even the slightest abnormality
p72
aVin any of these functions:
p73
aVvision, attention, language, audition.
p74
aVA program called Brain Electrical
p75
aVActivity Mapping
p76
aVthen triangulates the source
p77
aVof that abnormality in the brain.
p78
aVAnd another program called
p79
aVStatistical Probability Mapping
p80
aVthen performs mathematical calculations
p81
aVto determine whether any of these abnormalities
p82
aVare clinically significant,
p83
aVallowing us to provide a much more accurate
p84
aVneurological diagnosis
p85
aVof the child's symptoms.
p86
aVAnd so I became the head of neurophysiology
p87
aVfor the clinical arm of this team,
p88
aVand we're finally able to use this technology
p89
aVtowards actually helping
p90
aVchildren with brain disorders.
p91
aVAnd I'm happy to say that I'm now in the process
p92
aVof setting up this technology here in India.
p93
aa(lp94
VI'd like to tell you about one such child,
p95
aVwhose story was also covered by ABC News.
p96
aVSeven-year-old Justin Senigar
p97
aVcame to our clinic with this diagnosis
p98
aVof very severe autism.
p99
aVLike many autistic children,
p100
aVhis mind was locked inside his body.
p101
aVThere were moments when he would
p102
aVactually space out for seconds at a time.
p103
aVAnd the doctors told his parents
p104
aVhe was never going to be able
p105
aVto communicate or interact socially,
p106
aVand he would probably never have too much language.
p107
aa(lp108
VWhen we used this groundbreaking EEG technology
p109
aVto actually look at Justin's brain,
p110
aVthe results were startling.
p111
aVIt turned out that Justin was almost
p112
aVcertainly not autistic.
p113
aVHe was suffering from brain seizures
p114
aVthat were impossible to see with the naked eye,
p115
aVbut that were actually causing symptoms
p116
aVthat mimicked those of autism.
p117
aVAfter Justin was given anti-seizure medication,
p118
aVthe change in him was amazing.
p119
aVWithin a period of 60 days,
p120
aVhis vocabulary went from two to three words
p121
aVto 300 words.
p122
aVAnd his communication and social interaction
p123
aVwere improved so dramatically
p124
aVthat he was enrolled into a regular school
p125
aVand even became a karate super champ.
p126
aa(lp127
VResearch shows that 50 percent of children,
p128
aValmost 50 percent of children
p129
aVdiagnosed with autism
p130
aVare actually suffering from hidden brain seizures.
p131
aVThese are the faces of the children
p132
aVthat I have tested
p133
aVwith stories just like Justin.
p134
aVAll these children
p135
aVcame to our clinic with a diagnosis
p136
aVof autism, attention deficit disorder,
p137
aVmental retardation, language problems.
p138
aVInstead, our EEG scans revealed
p139
aVvery specific problems hidden within their brains
p140
aVthat couldn't possibly have been detected
p141
aVby their behavioral assessments.
p142
aVSo these EEG scans
p143
aVenabled us to provide these children
p144
aVwith a much more accurate neurological diagnosis
p145
aVand much more targeted treatment.
p146
aa(lp147
VFor too long now, children with developmental disorders
p148
aVhave suffered from misdiagnosis
p149
aVwhile their real problems have gone undetected
p150
aVand left to worsen.
p151
aVAnd for too long, these children and their parents
p152
aVhave suffered undue frustration and desperation.
p153
aVBut we are now in a new era of neuroscience,
p154
aVone in which we can finally look
p155
aVdirectly at brain function in real time
p156
aVwith no risks and no side effects, non-invasively,
p157
aVand find the true source
p158
aVof so many disabilities in children.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo if I could inspire
p161
aVeven a fraction of you in the audience today
p162
aVto share this pioneering diagnostic approach
p163
aVwith even one parent whose child
p164
aVis suffering from a developmental disorder,
p165
aVthen perhaps one more puzzle
p166
aVin one more brain will be solved.
p167
aVOne more mind will be unlocked.
p168
aVAnd one more child who has been misdiagnosed
p169
aVor even undiagnosed by the system
p170
aVwill finally realize his or her true potential
p171
aVwhile there's still time
p172
aVfor his or her brain to recover.
p173
aVAnd all this by simply watching the child's brainwaves.
p174
aa(lp175
VThank you.

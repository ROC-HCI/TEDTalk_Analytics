VSo, security is two different things:
p5
aVit's a feeling, and it's a reality.
p6
aVAnd they're different.
p7
aVYou could feel secure even if you're not.
p8
aVAnd you can be secure
p9
aVeven if you don't feel it.
p10
aVReally, we have two separate concepts
p11
aVmapped onto the same word.
p12
aVAnd what I want to do in this talk is to split them apart \u2014
p13
aVfiguring out when they diverge and how they converge.
p14
aVAnd language is actually a problem here.
p15
aVThere aren't a lot of good words
p16
aVfor the concepts we're going to talk about.
p17
aVSo if you look at security from economic terms,
p18
aVit's a trade-off.
p19
aa(lp20
VEvery time you get some security, you're always trading off something.
p21
aVWhether this is a personal decision \u2014
p22
aVwhether you're going to install a burglar alarm in your home \u2014
p23
aVor a national decision,
p24
aVwhere you're going to invade a foreign country \u2014
p25
aVyou're going to trade off something: money or time, convenience, capabilities,
p26
aVmaybe fundamental liberties.
p27
aVAnd the question to ask when you look at a security anything
p28
aVis not whether this makes us safer,
p29
aVbut whether it's worth the trade-off.
p30
aVYou've heard in the past several years, the world is safer
p31
aVbecause Saddam Hussein is not in power.
p32
aVThat might be true, but it's not terribly relevant.
p33
aVThe question is: Was it worth it?
p34
aVAnd you can make your own decision,
p35
aVand then you'll decide whether the invasion was worth it.
p36
aVThat's how you think about security: in terms of the trade-off.
p37
aa(lp38
VNow, there's often no right or wrong here.
p39
aVSome of us have a burglar alarm system at home and some of us don't.
p40
aVAnd it'll depend on where we live,
p41
aVwhether we live alone or have a family,
p42
aVhow much cool stuff we have,
p43
aVhow much we're willing to accept the risk of theft.
p44
aVIn politics also, there are different opinions.
p45
aVA lot of times, these trade-offs are about more than just security,
p46
aVand I think that's really important.
p47
aVNow, people have a natural intuition about these trade-offs.
p48
aVWe make them every day.
p49
aVLast night in my hotel room, when I decided to double-lock the door,
p50
aVor you in your car when you drove here;
p51
aVwhen we go eat lunch
p52
aVand decide the food's not poison and we'll eat it.
p53
aa(lp54
VWe make these trade-offs again and again,
p55
aVmultiple times a day.
p56
aVWe often won't even notice them.
p57
aVThey're just part of being alive; we all do it.
p58
aVEvery species does it.
p59
aVImagine a rabbit in a field, eating grass.
p60
aVAnd the rabbit sees a fox.
p61
aVThat rabbit will make a security trade-off:
p62
aV"Should I stay, or should I flee?"
p63
aVAnd if you think about it,
p64
aVthe rabbits that are good at making that trade-off
p65
aVwill tend to live and reproduce,
p66
aVand the rabbits that are bad at it
p67
aVwill get eaten or starve.
p68
aVSo you'd think
p69
aVthat us, as a successful species on the planet \u2014 you, me, everybody \u2014
p70
aVwould be really good at making these trade-offs.
p71
aVYet it seems, again and again, that we're hopelessly bad at it.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd I think that's a fundamentally interesting question.
p74
aVI'll give you the short answer.
p75
aVThe answer is, we respond to the feeling of security
p76
aVand not the reality.
p77
aVNow, most of the time, that works.
p78
aVMost of the time,
p79
aVfeeling and reality are the same.
p80
aVCertainly that's true for most of human prehistory.
p81
aVWe've developed this ability
p82
aVbecause it makes evolutionary sense.
p83
aVOne way to think of it is that we're highly optimized
p84
aVfor risk decisions
p85
aVthat are endemic to living in small family groups
p86
aVin the East African Highlands in 100,000 BC.
p87
aV2010 New York, not so much.
p88
aVNow, there are several biases in risk perception.
p89
aVA lot of good experiments in this.
p90
aVAnd you can see certain biases that come up again and again.
p91
aVI'll give you four.
p92
aa(lp93
VWe tend to exaggerate spectacular and rare risks
p94
aVand downplay common risks \u2014
p95
aVso, flying versus driving.
p96
aVThe unknown is perceived to be riskier than the familiar.
p97
aVOne example would be:
p98
aVpeople fear kidnapping by strangers,
p99
aVwhen the data supports that kidnapping by relatives is much more common.
p100
aVThis is for children.
p101
aVThird, personified risks are perceived to be greater
p102
aVthan anonymous risks.
p103
aVSo, Bin Laden is scarier because he has a name.
p104
aVAnd the fourth is:
p105
aVpeople underestimate risks in situations they do control
p106
aVand overestimate them in situations they don't control.
p107
aVSo once you take up skydiving or smoking,
p108
aVyou downplay the risks.
p109
aVIf a risk is thrust upon you \u2014 terrorism is a good example \u2014
p110
aVyou'll overplay it,
p111
aVbecause you don't feel like it's in your control.
p112
aa(lp113
VThere are a bunch of other of these cognitive biases,
p114
aVthat affect our risk decisions.
p115
aVThere's the availability heuristic,
p116
aVwhich basically means we estimate the probability of something
p117
aVby how easy it is to bring instances of it to mind.
p118
aVSo you can imagine how that works.
p119
aVIf you hear a lot about tiger attacks, there must be a lot of tigers around.
p120
aVYou don't hear about lion attacks, there aren't a lot of lions around.
p121
aVThis works, until you invent newspapers,
p122
aVbecause what newspapers do is repeat again and again
p123
aVrare risks.
p124
aVI tell people: if it's in the news, don't worry about it,
p125
aVbecause by definition, news is something that almost never happens.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VWhen something is so common, it's no longer news.
p130
aVCar crashes, domestic violence \u2014
p131
aVthose are the risks you worry about.
p132
aVWe're also a species of storytellers.
p133
aVWe respond to stories more than data.
p134
aVAnd there's some basic innumeracy going on.
p135
aVI mean, the joke "One, two, three, many" is kind of right.
p136
aVWe're really good at small numbers.
p137
aVOne mango, two mangoes, three mangoes,
p138
aV10,000 mangoes, 100,000 mangoes \u2014
p139
aVit's still more mangoes you can eat before they rot.
p140
aVSo one half, one quarter, one fifth \u2014 we're good at that.
p141
aVOne in a million, one in a billion \u2014
p142
aVthey're both almost never.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo we have trouble with the risks that aren't very common.
p145
aVAnd what these cognitive biases do
p146
aVis they act as filters between us and reality.
p147
aVAnd the result is that feeling and reality get out of whack,
p148
aVthey get different.
p149
aVNow, you either have a feeling \u2014 you feel more secure than you are,
p150
aVthere's a false sense of security.
p151
aVOr the other way, and that's a false sense of insecurity.
p152
aa(lp153
VI write a lot about "security theater,"
p154
aVwhich are products that make people feel secure,
p155
aVbut don't actually do anything.
p156
aVThere's no real word for stuff that makes us secure,
p157
aVbut doesn't make us feel secure.
p158
aVMaybe it's what the CIA is supposed to do for us.
p159
aVSo back to economics.
p160
aVIf economics, if the market, drives security,
p161
aVand if people make trade-offs based on the feeling of security,
p162
aVthen the smart thing for companies to do for the economic incentives
p163
aVis to make people feel secure.
p164
aVAnd there are two ways to do this.
p165
aa(lp166
VOne, you can make people actually secure
p167
aVand hope they notice.
p168
aVOr two, you can make people just feel secure
p169
aVand hope they don't notice.
p170
aVRight?
p171
aVSo what makes people notice?
p172
aVWell, a couple of things:
p173
aVunderstanding of the security,
p174
aVof the risks, the threats,
p175
aVthe countermeasures, how they work.
p176
aVBut if you know stuff, you're more likely
p177
aVto have your feelings match reality.
p178
aVEnough real-world examples helps.
p179
aVWe all know the crime rate in our neighborhood,
p180
aVbecause we live there, and we get a feeling about it
p181
aVthat basically matches reality.
p182
aVSecurity theater is exposed
p183
aVwhen it's obvious that it's not working properly.
p184
aa(lp185
VOK. So what makes people not notice?
p186
aVWell, a poor understanding.
p187
aVIf you don't understand the risks, you don't understand the costs,
p188
aVyou're likely to get the trade-off wrong,
p189
aVand your feeling doesn't match reality.
p190
aVNot enough examples.
p191
aVThere's an inherent problem with low-probability events.
p192
aVIf, for example, terrorism almost never happens,
p193
aVit's really hard to judge the efficacy of counter-terrorist measures.
p194
aVThis is why you keep sacrificing virgins,
p195
aVand why your unicorn defenses are working just great.
p196
aVThere aren't enough examples of failures.
p197
aVAlso, feelings that cloud the issues \u2014
p198
aVthe cognitive biases I talked about earlier: fears, folk beliefs \u2014
p199
aVbasically, an inadequate model of reality.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo let me complicate things.
p202
aVI have feeling and reality.
p203
aVI want to add a third element. I want to add "model."
p204
aVFeeling and model are in our head,
p205
aVreality is the outside world; it doesn't change, it's real.
p206
aVFeeling is based on our intuition,
p207
aVmodel is based on reason.
p208
aVThat's basically the difference.
p209
aVIn a primitive and simple world,
p210
aVthere's really no reason for a model,
p211
aVbecause feeling is close to reality.
p212
aVYou don't need a model.
p213
aVBut in a modern and complex world,
p214
aVyou need models to understand a lot of the risks we face.
p215
aa(lp216
VThere's no feeling about germs.
p217
aVYou need a model to understand them.
p218
aVThis model is an intelligent representation of reality.
p219
aVIt's, of course, limited by science, by technology.
p220
aVWe couldn't have a germ theory of disease
p221
aVbefore we invented the microscope to see them.
p222
aVIt's limited by our cognitive biases.
p223
aVBut it has the ability to override our feelings.
p224
aVWhere do we get these models? We get them from others.
p225
aVWe get them from religion, from culture, teachers, elders.
p226
aa(lp227
VA couple years ago, I was in South Africa on safari.
p228
aVThe tracker I was with grew up in Kruger National Park.
p229
aVHe had some very complex models of how to survive.
p230
aVAnd it depended on if you were attacked by a lion, leopard, rhino, or elephant \u2014
p231
aVand when you had to run away, when you couldn't run away,
p232
aVwhen you had to climb a tree, when you could never climb a tree.
p233
aVI would have died in a day.
p234
aVBut he was born there, and he understood how to survive.
p235
aVI was born in New York City.
p236
aVI could have taken him to New York, and he would have died in a day.
p237
aa(lp238
V(Laughter)
p239
aa(lp240
VBecause we had different models based on our different experiences.
p241
aVModels can come from the media,
p242
aVfrom our elected officials ...
p243
aVThink of models of terrorism,
p244
aVchild kidnapping,
p245
aVairline safety, car safety.
p246
aVModels can come from industry.
p247
aVThe two I'm following are surveillance cameras,
p248
aVID cards,
p249
aVquite a lot of our computer security models come from there.
p250
aa(lp251
VA lot of models come from science.
p252
aVHealth models are a great example.
p253
aVThink of cancer, bird flu, swine flu, SARS.
p254
aVAll of our feelings of security about those diseases
p255
aVcome from models given to us, really, by science filtered through the media.
p256
aVSo models can change.
p257
aVModels are not static.
p258
aVAs we become more comfortable in our environments,
p259
aVour model can move closer to our feelings.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo an example might be,
p262
aVif you go back 100 years ago,
p263
aVwhen electricity was first becoming common,
p264
aVthere were a lot of fears about it.
p265
aVThere were people who were afraid to push doorbells,
p266
aVbecause there was electricity in there, and that was dangerous.
p267
aVFor us, we're very facile around electricity.
p268
aVWe change light bulbs without even thinking about it.
p269
aVOur model of security around electricity is something we were born into.
p270
aVIt hasn't changed as we were growing up.
p271
aVAnd we're good at it.
p272
aVOr think of the risks on the Internet across generations \u2014
p273
aVhow your parents approach Internet security,
p274
aVversus how you do,
p275
aVversus how our kids will.
p276
aa(lp277
VModels eventually fade into the background.
p278
aV"Intuitive" is just another word for familiar.
p279
aVSo as your model is close to reality and it converges with feelings,
p280
aVyou often don't even know it's there.
p281
aVA nice example of this came from last year and swine flu.
p282
aVWhen swine flu first appeared,
p283
aVthe initial news caused a lot of overreaction.
p284
aVNow, it had a name,
p285
aVwhich made it scarier than the regular flu,
p286
aVeven though it was more deadly.
p287
aVAnd people thought doctors should be able to deal with it.
p288
aVSo there was that feeling of lack of control.
p289
aVAnd those two things made the risk more than it was.
p290
aa(lp291
VAs the novelty wore off and the months went by,
p292
aVthere was some amount of tolerance; people got used to it.
p293
aVThere was no new data, but there was less fear.
p294
aVBy autumn,
p295
aVpeople thought the doctors should have solved this already.
p296
aVAnd there's kind of a bifurcation:
p297
aVpeople had to choose between fear and acceptance \u2014
p298
aVactually, fear and indifference \u2014
p299
aVand they kind of chose suspicion.
p300
aVAnd when the vaccine appeared last winter,
p301
aVthere were a lot of people \u2014 a surprising number \u2014
p302
aVwho refused to get it.
p303
aVAnd it's a nice example of how people's feelings of security change,
p304
aVhow their model changes,
p305
aVsort of wildly,
p306
aVwith no new information, with no new input.
p307
aVThis kind of thing happens a lot.
p308
aa(lp309
VI'm going to give one more complication.
p310
aVWe have feeling, model, reality.
p311
aVI have a very relativistic view of security.
p312
aVI think it depends on the observer.
p313
aVAnd most security decisions have a variety of people involved.
p314
aVAnd stakeholders with specific trade-offs will try to influence the decision.
p315
aVAnd I call that their agenda.
p316
aVAnd you see agenda \u2014 this is marketing, this is politics \u2014
p317
aVtrying to convince you to have one model versus another,
p318
aVtrying to convince you to ignore a model
p319
aVand trust your feelings,
p320
aVmarginalizing people with models you don't like.
p321
aVThis is not uncommon.
p322
aVAn example, a great example, is the risk of smoking.
p323
aVIn the history of the past 50 years,
p324
aVthe smoking risk shows how a model changes,
p325
aVand it also shows how an industry fights against a model it doesn't like.
p326
aa(lp327
VCompare that to the secondhand smoke debate \u2014
p328
aVprobably about 20 years behind.
p329
aVThink about seat belts.
p330
aVWhen I was a kid, no one wore a seat belt.
p331
aVNowadays, no kid will let you drive if you're not wearing a seat belt.
p332
aVCompare that to the airbag debate,
p333
aVprobably about 30 years behind.
p334
aVAll examples of models changing.
p335
aVWhat we learn is that changing models is hard.
p336
aVModels are hard to dislodge.
p337
aVIf they equal your feelings,
p338
aVyou don't even know you have a model.
p339
aVAnd there's another cognitive bias
p340
aVI'll call confirmation bias,
p341
aVwhere we tend to accept data that confirms our beliefs
p342
aVand reject data that contradicts our beliefs.
p343
aVSo evidence against our model, we're likely to ignore,
p344
aVeven if it's compelling.
p345
aVIt has to get very compelling before we'll pay attention.
p346
aa(lp347
VNew models that extend long periods of time are hard.
p348
aVGlobal warming is a great example.
p349
aVWe're terrible at models that span 80 years.
p350
aVWe can do "to the next harvest."
p351
aVWe can often do "until our kids grow up."
p352
aVBut "80 years," we're just not good at.
p353
aVSo it's a very hard model to accept.
p354
aVWe can have both models in our head simultaneously \u2014
p355
aVthat kind of problem where we're holding both beliefs together,
p356
aVthe cognitive dissonance.
p357
aVEventually, the new model will replace the old model.
p358
aa(lp359
VStrong feelings can create a model.
p360
aVSeptember 11 created a security model in a lot of people's heads.
p361
aVAlso, personal experiences with crime can do it,
p362
aVpersonal health scare,
p363
aVa health scare in the news.
p364
aVYou'll see these called "flashbulb events" by psychiatrists.
p365
aVThey can create a model instantaneously,
p366
aVbecause they're very emotive.
p367
aVSo in the technological world,
p368
aVwe don't have experience to judge models.
p369
aVAnd we rely on others. We rely on proxies.
p370
aVAnd this works, as long as it's the correct others.
p371
aa(lp372
VWe rely on government agencies
p373
aVto tell us what pharmaceuticals are safe.
p374
aVI flew here yesterday.
p375
aVI didn't check the airplane.
p376
aVI relied on some other group
p377
aVto determine whether my plane was safe to fly.
p378
aVWe're here, none of us fear the roof is going to collapse on us,
p379
aVnot because we checked,
p380
aVbut because we're pretty sure the building codes here are good.
p381
aVIt's a model we just accept
p382
aVpretty much by faith.
p383
aVAnd that's OK.
p384
aa(lp385
VNow, what we want is people to get familiar enough with better models,
p386
aVhave it reflected in their feelings,
p387
aVto allow them to make security trade-offs.
p388
aVWhen these go out of whack, you have two options.
p389
aVOne, you can fix people's feelings, directly appeal to feelings.
p390
aVIt's manipulation, but it can work.
p391
aVThe second, more honest way
p392
aVis to actually fix the model.
p393
aVChange happens slowly.
p394
aVThe smoking debate took 40 years \u2014 and that was an easy one.
p395
aVSome of this stuff is hard.
p396
aVReally, though, information seems like our best hope.
p397
aa(lp398
VAnd I lied.
p399
aVRemember I said feeling, model, reality; reality doesn't change?
p400
aVIt actually does.
p401
aVWe live in a technological world;
p402
aVreality changes all the time.
p403
aVSo we might have, for the first time in our species:
p404
aVfeeling chases model, model chases reality, reality's moving \u2014
p405
aVthey might never catch up.
p406
aVWe don't know.
p407
aVBut in the long term,
p408
aVboth feeling and reality are important.
p409
aa(lp410
VAnd I want to close with two quick stories to illustrate this.
p411
aV1982 \u2014 I don't know if people will remember this \u2014
p412
aVthere was a short epidemic of Tylenol poisonings
p413
aVin the United States.
p414
aVIt's a horrific story.
p415
aVSomeone took a bottle of Tylenol,
p416
aVput poison in it, closed it up, put it back on the shelf,
p417
aVsomeone else bought it and died.
p418
aVThis terrified people.
p419
aVThere were a couple of copycat attacks.
p420
aVThere wasn't any real risk, but people were scared.
p421
aVAnd this is how the tamper-proof drug industry was invented.
p422
aVThose tamper-proof caps? That came from this.
p423
aVIt's complete security theater.
p424
aVAs a homework assignment, think of 10 ways to get around it.
p425
aVI'll give you one: a syringe.
p426
aVBut it made people feel better.
p427
aVIt made their feeling of security more match the reality.
p428
aa(lp429
VLast story: a few years ago, a friend of mine gave birth.
p430
aVI visit her in the hospital.
p431
aVIt turns out, when a baby's born now,
p432
aVthey put an RFID bracelet on the baby, a corresponding one on the mother,
p433
aVso if anyone other than the mother takes the baby out of the maternity ward,
p434
aVan alarm goes off.
p435
aVI said, "Well, that's kind of neat.
p436
aVI wonder how rampant baby snatching is out of hospitals."
p437
aVI go home, I look it up.
p438
aVIt basically never happens.
p439

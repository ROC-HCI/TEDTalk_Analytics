VNow, I've been making pictures for quite a long time,
p5
aVand normally speaking, a picture like this, for me,
p6
aVshould be straightforward.
p7
aVI'm in southern Ethiopia. I'm with the Daasanach.
p8
aVThere's a big family, there's a very beautiful tree,
p9
aVand I make these pictures with this very large,
p10
aVextremely cumbersome, very awkward technical plate film camera.
p11
aVDoes anybody know 4x5 and 10x8 sheets of film,
p12
aVand you're setting it up, putting it on the tripod.
p13
aVI've got the family, spent the better part of a day talking with them.
p14
aVThey sort of understand what I'm on about.
p15
aVThey think I'm a bit crazy, but that's another story.
p16
aVAnd what's most important for me is the beauty and the aesthetic,
p17
aVand that's based on the light.
p18
aVSo the light's setting on my left-hand side,
p19
aVand there's a balance in the communication with the Daasanach,
p20
aVthe family of 30, all ages.
p21
aVThere's babies and there's grandparents,
p22
aVI'm getting them in the tree and waiting for the light to set,
p23
aVand it's going, going, and I've got one sheet of film left,
p24
aVand I think, I'm okay, I'm in control, I'm in control.
p25
aVI'm setting it up and I'm setting up, and the light's just about to go,
p26
aVand I want it to be golden, I want it to be beautiful.
p27
aVI want it to be hanging on the horizon so it lights these people,
p28
aVin all the potential glory that they could be presented.
p29
aVAnd it's about to go  and it's about to go,
p30
aVand I put my sheet in the camera,
p31
aVit's all focused,
p32
aVand all of a sudden there's a massive "whack,"
p33
aVand I'm looking around, and in the top corner of the tree,
p34
aVone of the girls slaps the girl next to her,
p35
aVand the girl next to her pulls her hair, and all hell breaks loose,
p36
aVand I'm standing there going, "But the light, the light.
p37
aVWait, I need the light. Stay still! Stay still!"
p38
aVAnd they start screaming,
p39
aVand then one of the men turns around and starts screaming, shouting,
p40
aVand the whole tree collapses, not the tree, but the people in the tree.
p41
aVThey're all running around screaming, and they run back off into the village
p42
aVin this sort of cloud of smoke, and I'm left there standing behind my tripod.
p43
aVI've got my sheet, and the light's gone, and I can't make the picture.
p44
aVWhere have they all gone? I had no idea.
p45
aa(lp46
VIt took me a week, it took me a week to make the picture which you see here today,
p47
aVand I'll tell you why. (Applause)
p48
aVIt's very, very, very simple \u2014 I spent a week going around the village,
p49
aVand I went to every single one: "Hello, can you meet at the tree?
p50
aVWhat's your story? Who are you?"
p51
aVAnd it all turned out to be about a boyfriend, for crying out loud.
p52
aVI mean, I have teenage kids. I should know.
p53
aVIt was about a boyfriend. The girl on the top, she'd kissed the wrong boy,
p54
aVand they'd started having a fight.
p55
aVAnd there was a very, very beautiful lesson for me in that:
p56
aVIf I was going to photograph these people
p57
aVin the dignified, respectful way that I had intended,
p58
aVand put them on a pedestal, I had to understand them.
p59
aVIt wasn't just about turning up. It wasn't just about shaking a hand.
p60
aVIt wasn't about just saying, "I'm Jimmy, I'm a photographer."
p61
aVI had to get to know every single one of them,
p62
aVright down to whose boyfriend is who and who is allowed to kiss who.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo in the end, a week later,
p65
aVand I was absolutely exhausted,
p66
aVI mean on my knees going, "Please get back up in that tree.
p67
aVIt's a picture I need to make."
p68
aVThey all came back. I put them all back up in the tree.
p69
aVI made sure the girls were in the right position,
p70
aVand the ones that slapped, one was over there.
p71
aVThey did look at each other. If you look at it later,
p72
aVthey're staring at each other very angrily,
p73
aVand I've got the tree and everything,
p74
aVand then at the last minute, I go, "The goat, the goat!
p75
aVI need something for the eye to look at. I need a white goat in the middle."
p76
aVSo I swapped all the goats around. I put the goats in.
p77
aVBut even then I got it wrong, because if you can see on the left-hand side,
p78
aVanother little boy storms off because I didn't choose his goat.
p79
aVSo the moral being I have to learn to speak Goat as well as Daasanach.
p80
aa(lp81
VBut anyway, the effort that goes into that picture
p82
aVand the story that I've just related to you,
p83
aVas you can imagine,
p84
aVthere are hundreds of other bizarre, eccentric stories
p85
aVof hundreds of other people around the world.
p86
aVAnd this was about four years ago, and I set off on a journey,
p87
aVto be honest, a very indulgent journey.
p88
aVI'm a real romantic. I'm an idealist, perhaps in some ways naive.
p89
aVBut I truly believe that there are people on the planet that are beautiful.
p90
aVIt's very, very simple. It's not rocket science.
p91
aVI wanted to put these people on a pedestal.
p92
aVI wanted to put them on a pedestal like they'd never been seen before.
p93
aVSo, I chose about 35 different groups,
p94
aVtribes, indigenous cultures.
p95
aVThey were chosen purely because of their aesthetic,
p96
aVand I'll talk more about that later.
p97
aVI'm not an anthropologist, I have no technical study with the subject,
p98
aVbut I do have a very, very, very deep passion,
p99
aVand I believe that I had to choose the most beautiful people on the planet
p100
aVin the most beautiful environment that they lived in,
p101
aVand put the two together and present them to you.
p102
aa(lp103
VAbout a year ago,
p104
aVI published the first pictures,
p105
aVand something extraordinarily exciting happened.
p106
aVThe whole world came running,
p107
aVand it was a bizarre experience, because everybody, from everywhere:
p108
aV"Who are they? What are they? How many are they?
p109
aVWhere did you find them? Are they real? You faked it.
p110
aVTell me. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me." Millions of questions for which,
p111
aVto be honest, I don't have the answers.
p112
aVI really didn't have the answers,
p113
aVand I could sort of understand, okay, they're beautiful, that was my intention,
p114
aVbut the questions that I was being fired at,
p115
aVI could not answer them.
p116
aa(lp117
VUntil, it was quite amusing, about a year ago
p118
aVsomebody said, "You've been invited to do a TED Talk."
p119
aVAnd I said, "Ted? Ted? Who's Ted? I haven't met Ted before."
p120
aVHe said, "No, a TED Talk." I said, "But who's Ted?
p121
aVDo I have to talk to him or do we sit with each other on the stage?"
p122
aVAnd, "No, no, the TED group. You must know about it."
p123
aVAnd I said, "I've been in a teepee and in a yurt for the last five years.
p124
aVHow do I know who Ted is? Introduce me to him."
p125
aVAnyway, to cut a long story short, he said, "We have to do a TED Talk."
p126
aVResearched. Oh, exciting. That's great!
p127
aVAnd then eventually you're going to go to TEDGlobal.
p128
aVEven more exciting.
p129
aVBut what you need to do, you need to teach the people lessons,
p130
aVlessons that you've learned on your travels around the world
p131
aVwith these tribes.
p132
aVI thought, lessons, okay, well, what did I learn? Good question.
p133
aVThree. You need three lessons, and they need to be terribly profound.
p134
aV(Laughter)
p135
aVAnd I thought, three lessons, well, I'm going to think about it.
p136
aV(Applause)
p137
aa(lp138
VSo I thought long and hard, and I stood here two days ago,
p139
aVand I had my test run, and I had my cards
p140
aVand my clicker in my hands and my pictures were on the screen,
p141
aVand I had my three lessons, and I started presenting them,
p142
aVand I had this very odd out-of-body experience.
p143
aVI sort of looked at myself standing there, going, "Oh, Jimmy,
p144
aVthis is complete loads of codswallop.
p145
aVAll these people sitting here, they've had more of these talks,
p146
aVthey've heard more lessons in their life.
p147
aVWho are you to tell them what you've learned?
p148
aVWho are you to guide them and who are you to show them
p149
aVwhat is right, what is wrong, what these people have to say?"
p150
aVAnd I had a little bit of a, it was very private,
p151
aVa little bit of a meltdown.
p152
aVI went back, and a little bit like the boy walking away from the tree with his goats,
p153
aVvery disgruntled, going, that didn't work,
p154
aVIt wasn't what I wanted to communicate.
p155
aVAnd I thought long and hard about it, and I thought, well, the only thing
p156
aVI can communicate is very, very basic.
p157
aVYou have to turn it all the way around.
p158
aVThere's only one person I know here, and that's me.
p159
aVI'm still getting to know myself,
p160
aVand it's a lifelong journey, and I probably won't have all the answers,
p161
aVbut I did learn some extraordinary things on this journey.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo what I'm going to do is share with you my lessons.
p164
aVIt's a very, as I explained at the beginning, very indulgent, very personal,
p165
aVhow and why I made these pictures,
p166
aVand I leave it to you as the audience to interpret what these lessons
p167
aVhave meant to me, what they could perhaps mean to you.
p168
aa(lp169
VI traveled enormously as a child.
p170
aVI was very nomadic. It was actually very exciting.
p171
aVAll around the world,
p172
aVand I had this feeling that I was pushed off at great speed
p173
aVto become somebody, become that individual, Jimmy.
p174
aVGo off into the planet, and so I ran, and I ran,
p175
aVand my wife sometimes kids me, "Jimmy, you look a bit like Forrest Gump,"
p176
aVbut I'm, "No, it's all about something, trust me."
p177
aVSo I kept running and I kept running, and I sort of got somewhere
p178
aVand I sort of stood there and looked around me and I thought, well,
p179
aVwhere do I belong? Where do I fit?
p180
aVWhat am I? Where am I from? I had no idea.
p181
aVSo I hope there aren't too many psychologists in this audience.
p182
aVPerhaps part of this journey
p183
aVis about me trying to find out where I belonged.
p184
aVSo whilst going, and don't worry, I didn't when I arrived with these tribes,
p185
aVI didn't paint myself yellow and run around with these spears and loincloths.
p186
aa(lp187
VBut what I did find were people that belonged themselves,
p188
aVand they inspired me, some extraordinary people,
p189
aVand I'd like to introduce you to some heroes of mine.
p190
aVThey're the Huli.
p191
aa(lp192
VNow, the Huli are some of the most extraordinarily beautiful people
p193
aVon the planet.
p194
aVThey're proud. They live in the Papua New Guinean highlands.
p195
aVThere's not many of them left, and they're called the Huli wigmen.
p196
aVAnd images like this, I mean, this is what it's all about for me.
p197
aVAnd you've spent weeks and months there talking with them, getting there,
p198
aVand I want to put them on a pedestal, and I said, "You have something
p199
aVthat many people have not seen.
p200
aVYou sit in this stunning nature."
p201
aVAnd it really does look like this, and they really do look like this.
p202
aVThis is the real thing.
p203
aVAnd you know why they're proud? You know why they look like this,
p204
aVand why I broke my back literally
p205
aVto photograph them and present them to you?
p206
aVIt's because they have these extraordinary rituals.
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd the Huli have this ritual: When they're teenagers,
p209
aVbecoming a man, they have to shave their heads,
p210
aVand they spend the rest of their life shaving their heads every single day,
p211
aVand what they do with that hair,
p212
aVthey make it into a creation,
p213
aVa creation that's a very personal creation.
p214
aVIt's their creation. It's their Huli creation.
p215
aVSo they're called the Huli wigmen.
p216
aVThat's a wig on his head.
p217
aVIt's all made out of his human hair.
p218
aVAnd then they decorate that wig with the feathers of the birds of paradise,
p219
aVand don't worry, there are many birds there.
p220
aVThere's very few people living, so nothing to get too upset about,
p221
aVand they spend the rest of their life recreating these hats
p222
aVand getting further and further,
p223
aVand it's extraordinary, and there's another group,
p224
aVthey're called the Kalam, and they live in the next valley,
p225
aVbut they speak a completely different language,
p226
aVthey look completely different, and they wear a hat,
p227
aVand it's built out of scarabs,
p228
aVthese fantastic emerald green little scarabs,
p229
aVand sometimes there are 5,000 or 6,000 scarabs in this hat,
p230
aVand they spend the whole of their life collecting these scarabs
p231
aVto build these hats.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo the Huli inspired me in that they belong.
p234
aVPerhaps I have to work harder at finding a ritual which matters for me
p235
aVand going back into my past to see where I actually fit.
p236
aa(lp237
VAn extremely important part of this project
p238
aVwas about how I photograph these extraordinary people.
p239
aVAnd it's basically beauty. I think beauty matters.
p240
aVWe spend the whole of our existence revolving around beauty:
p241
aVbeautiful places, beautiful things, and ultimately, beautiful people.
p242
aVIt's very, very, very significant.
p243
aVI've spent all of my life analyzing what do I look like?
p244
aVAm I perceived as beautiful?
p245
aVDoes it matter if I'm a beautiful person or not,
p246
aVor is it purely based on my aesthetic?
p247
aVAnd then when I went off, I came to a very narrow conclusion.
p248
aVDo I have to go around the world photographing, excuse me,
p249
aVwomen between the age of 25 and 30? Is that what beauty is going to be?
p250
aVIs everything before and after that utterly irrelevant?
p251
aa(lp252
VAnd it was only until I went on a journey,
p253
aVa journey that was so extreme,
p254
aVI still get shivers when I think about it.
p255
aVI went to a part of the world, and I don't know whether any of you
p256
aVhave ever heard of Chukotka. Has anybody ever heard of Chukotka?
p257
aVChukotka probably is, technically, as far as one can go
p258
aVand still be on the living planet.
p259
aVIt's 13 hours' flight from Moscow.
p260
aVFirst you've got to get to Moscow, and then 13 hours' flight nonstop from Moscow.
p261
aVAnd that's if you get there.
p262
aVAs you can see, some people sort of miss the runway.
p263
aa(lp264
VAnd then when you land there, in Chukotka are the Chukchis.
p265
aVNow, the Chukchis are the last indigenous Inuits of Siberia,
p266
aVand they're people I'd heard about, I'd hardly seen any images of,
p267
aVbut I knew they were there,
p268
aVand I'd been in touch with this guide,
p269
aVand this guide said,
p270
aV"There's this fantastic tribe. There's only about 40 of them.
p271
aVYou'll be okay. We'll find them." So off we went on this journey.
p272
aVWhen we arrived there, after a month of traveling across the ice,
p273
aVand we'd got to them, but then I was not allowed to photograph them.
p274
aVThey said, "You cannot photograph us. You have to wait.
p275
aVYou have to wait until you get to know us. You have to wait until you understand us.
p276
aVYou have to wait until you see how we interact with one another."
p277
aVAnd only then, it was many, many weeks later, I saw a respect.
p278
aVThey had zero judgment.
p279
aVThey observed one another, from the youth, from the middle aged to the old.
p280
aVThey need each other.
p281
aVThe children need to chew the meat all day
p282
aVbecause the adults don't have any teeth,
p283
aVbut at the same time, the children take the old aged people out
p284
aVto the toilet because they're infirm,
p285
aVso there's this fantastic community of respect.
p286
aVAnd they adore and admire one another, and they truly taught me
p287
aVwhat beauty was.
p288
aV(Applause)
p289
aa(lp290
VNow I'm going to ask for a little bit of audience interaction.
p291
aVThis is extremely important for the end of my talk.
p292
aVIf you could look at somebody left to the right of you,
p293
aVand I want you to observe them,
p294
aVand I want you to give them a compliment. This is very important.
p295
aVNow, it may be their nose or their hair or even their aura, I don't mind,
p296
aVbut please look at each other, give them a compliment.
p297
aVYou have to be quick, because I'm running out of time.
p298
aVAnd you have to remember it.
p299
aa(lp300
VOkay, thank you, thank you, thank you, you've given each other compliments.
p301
aVHold that compliment very, very tightly. Hold it for later.
p302
aa(lp303
VAnd the last thing, it was extraordinarily profound,
p304
aVand it happened only two weeks ago. Two weeks ago I went back to the Himba.
p305
aVNow, the Himba live in northern Namibia on the border of Angola,
p306
aVand I'd been there a few times before,
p307
aVand I'd gone back to present this book I'd made,
p308
aVto show them the pictures, to get into a discussion with them,
p309
aVto say, "This is how I saw you. This is how I love you.
p310
aVThis is how I respect you. What do you think? Am I right? Am I wrong?"
p311
aVSo I wanted this debate. It was very, very, very emotional,
p312
aVand one night we were sitting around the campfire,
p313
aVand I have to be honest, I think I'd had a little bit too much to drink,
p314
aVand I was sort of sitting under the stars going, "This is great,
p315
aVyou've seen my pictures, we love each other." (Laughter)
p316
aVAnd I'm a little bit slow,
p317
aVand I looked around me, and I said,
p318
aVI thought, maybe, the fence is missing.
p319
aVWasn't there a fence here last time I came?
p320
aVYou know, this big protective fence around the village,
p321
aVand they sort of looked at me and go, "Yeah, chief die."
p322
aVAnd I thought, okay, chief dying, right, you know,
p323
aVlook up at the stars again, look at the campfire.
p324
aVChief die. What on Earth does chief die have to do with the fence?
p325
aV"Chief die.
p326
aVFirst we destroy, yeah? Then we reflect.
p327
aVThen we rebuild. Then we respect."
p328
aVAnd I burst out in tears, because my father had only just died
p329
aVprior to this journey,
p330
aVand I didn't ever acknowledge him,
p331
aVI didn't ever appreciate him for the fact that I'm probably standing here today
p332
aVbecause of him.
p333
aVThese people taught me that we are only who we are because of our parents
p334
aVand our grandparents and our forefathers
p335
aVgoing on and on and on before that,
p336
aVand I, no matter how romantic or how idealistic I am on this journey,
p337
aVI did not know that until two weeks ago.
p338
aVI did not know that until two weeks ago.
p339
aa(lp340
VSo what's this all about?
p341
aVWell, there's an image I'd like to show you,
p342
aVquite a special image, and it wasn't essentially the image I wanted to choose.
p343
aVI was sitting there the other day, and I have to finish on a strong image.
p344
aVAnd somebody said, "You have to show them the picture of the Nenets. The Nenets."
p345
aVI was like, yeah, but that's not my favorite picture.
p346
aVShe went, "No no no no no no no. It's an amazing picture.
p347
aVYou're in his eyes."
p348
aVI said, "What do you mean I'm in his eyes? It's a picture of the Nenets."
p349
aVShe said, "No, look, look closely, you're in his eyes."
p350
aVAnd when you look closely at this picture, there is a reflection of me in his eyes,
p351
aVso I think perhaps he has my soul, and I'm in his soul,
p352
aVand whilst these pictures look at you, I ask you to look at them.
p353
aVYou may not be reflected in his eyes,
p354
aVbut there is something extraordinarily important about these people.
p355
aVI don't ultimately have the answers, as I've just shared with you,
p356
aVbut you must do. There must be something there.
p357
aVSo if you can briefly reflect on what I was discussing
p358
aVabout beauty and about belonging and about our ancestors and our roots,
p359
aVand I need you all to stand for me, please.
p360
aV(Laughter)
p361
aVNow you have no excuse. It's almost lunchtime,
p362
aVand this is not a standing ovation, so don't worry,
p363
aVI'm not fishing for compliments.
p364
aVBut you were given a compliment a few minutes ago.
p365
aVNow I want you to stand tall.
p366
aVI want you to breathe in. This is what I say.
p367
aVI'm not going to get on my knees for two weeks.
p368
aVI'm not going to ask you to carry a goat,
p369
aVand I know you don't have any camels.
p370
aVPhotography's extraordinarily powerful.
p371
aVIt's this language which we now all understand.
p372
aVWe truly do all understand it,
p373
aVand we have this global digital fireplace, don't we,
p374
aVbut I want to share you with the world,
p375
aVbecause you are also a tribe.
p376
aVYou are the TED tribe, yeah? But you have to remember that compliment.
p377
aVYou have to stand tall, breathe in through your nose,
p378
aVand I'm going to photograph you. Okay?
p379
aVI need to do a panoramic shot, so it's going to take a minute,
p380
aVso you have to concentrate, okay?
p381
aVBreathe in, stand tall, no laughing. Shh, breathe through your nose.
p382
aVI'm going to photograph.
p383
aa(lp384
V(Clicks)
p385
aa(lp386
VThank you.
p387
aa(lp388

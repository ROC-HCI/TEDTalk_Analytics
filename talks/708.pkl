VThe National Portrait Gallery is the place dedicated
p5
aVto presenting great American lives,
p6
aVamazing people.
p7
aVAnd that's what it's about.
p8
aVWe use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives, but that's it.
p9
aVAnd so I'm not going to talk about the painted portrait today.
p10
aVI'm going to talk about a program I started there,
p11
aVwhich, from my point of view, is the proudest thing I did.
p12
aa(lp13
VI started to worry about the fact
p14
aVthat a lot of people don't get their portraits painted anymore,
p15
aVand they're amazing people,
p16
aVand we want to deliver them to future generations.
p17
aVSo, how do we do that?
p18
aVAnd so I came up with the idea of the living self-portrait series.
p19
aVAnd the living self-portrait series was the idea of basically
p20
aVmy being a brush in the hand
p21
aVof amazing people who would come and I would interview.
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd so what I'm going to do is, not so much give you
p24
aVthe great hits of that program,
p25
aVas to give you this whole notion
p26
aVof how you encounter people in that kind of situation,
p27
aVwhat you try to find out about them,
p28
aVand when people deliver and when they don't and why.
p29
aa(lp30
VNow, I had two preconditions.
p31
aVOne was that they be American.
p32
aVThat's just because, in the nature of the National Portrait Gallery,
p33
aVit's created to look at American lives.
p34
aVThat was easy, but then I made the decision,
p35
aVmaybe arbitrary,
p36
aVthat they needed to be people of a certain age,
p37
aVwhich at that point, when I created this program,
p38
aVseemed really old.
p39
aVSixties, seventies, eighties and nineties.
p40
aVFor obvious reasons, it doesn't seem that old anymore to me.
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd why did I do that?
p43
aVWell, for one thing, we're a youth-obsessed culture.
p44
aVAnd I thought really what we need is an elders program
p45
aVto just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk.
p46
aVBut the second part of it \u2014 and the older I get,
p47
aVthe more convinced I am that that's true.
p48
aVIt's amazing what people will say when they know
p49
aVhow the story turned out.
p50
aVThat's the one advantage that older people have.
p51
aVWell, they have other, little bit of advantage,
p52
aVbut they also have some disadvantages,
p53
aVbut the one thing they or we have is that
p54
aVwe've reached the point in life
p55
aVwhere we know how the story turned out.
p56
aVSo, we can then go back in our lives,
p57
aVif we've got an interviewer who gets that,
p58
aVand begin to reflect on how we got there.
p59
aVAll of those accidents that wound up
p60
aVcreating the life narrative that we inherited.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo, I thought okay, now,
p63
aVwhat is it going to take to make this work?
p64
aVThere are many kinds of interviews. We know them.
p65
aVThere are the journalist interviews,
p66
aVwhich are the interrogation that is expected.
p67
aVThis is somewhat against resistance
p68
aVand caginess on the part of the interviewee.
p69
aVThen there's the celebrity interview,
p70
aVwhere it's more important who's asking the question than who answers.
p71
aVThat's Barbara Walters and others like that, and we like that.
p72
aVThat's Frost-Nixon, where Frost seems to be as important
p73
aVas Nixon in that process.
p74
aVFair enough.
p75
aa(lp76
VBut I wanted interviews that were different.
p77
aVI wanted to be, as I later thought of it, empathic,
p78
aVwhich is to say, to feel what they wanted to say
p79
aVand to be an agent of their self-revelation.
p80
aVBy the way, this was always done in public.
p81
aVThis was not an oral history program.
p82
aVThis was all about 300 people sitting at the feet of this individual,
p83
aVand having me be the brush in their self-portrait.
p84
aa(lp85
VNow, it turns out that I was pretty good at that.
p86
aVI didn't know it coming into it.
p87
aVAnd the only reason I really know that
p88
aVis because of one interview I did with Senator William Fulbright,
p89
aVand that was six months after he'd had a stroke.
p90
aVAnd he had never appeared in public since that point.
p91
aVThis was not a devastating stroke,
p92
aVbut it did affect his speaking and so forth.
p93
aVAnd I thought it was worth a chance,
p94
aVhe thought it was worth a chance,
p95
aVand so we got up on the stage,
p96
aVand we had an hour conversation about his life,
p97
aVand after that a woman rushed up to me,
p98
aVessentially did,
p99
aVand she said, "Where did you train as a doctor?"
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd I said, "I have no training as a doctor. I never claimed that."
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd she said, "Well, something very weird was happening.
p104
aVWhen he started a sentence, particularly
p105
aVin the early parts of the interview,
p106
aVand paused, you gave him the word,
p107
aVthe bridge to get to the end of the sentence,
p108
aVand by the end of it,
p109
aVhe was speaking complete sentences on his own."
p110
aVI didn't know what was going on,
p111
aVbut I was so part of the process of getting that out.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo I thought, okay, fine, I've got empathy,
p114
aVor empathy, at any rate,
p115
aVis what's critical to this kind of interview.
p116
aVBut then I began to think of other things.
p117
aVWho makes a great interview in this context?
p118
aVIt had nothing to do with their intellect,
p119
aVthe quality of their intellect.
p120
aVSome of them were very brilliant,
p121
aVsome of them were,
p122
aVyou know, ordinary people who would never claim to be intellectuals,
p123
aVbut it was never about that.
p124
aVIt was about their energy.
p125
aVIt's energy that creates extraordinary interviews
p126
aVand extraordinary lives.
p127
aVI'm convinced of it.
p128
aVAnd it had nothing to do with the energy of being young.
p129
aVThese were people through their 90s.
p130
aa(lp131
VIn fact, the first person I interviewed
p132
aVwas George Abbott, who was 97,
p133
aVand Abbott was filled with the life force \u2014
p134
aVI guess that's the way I think about it \u2014 filled with it.
p135
aVAnd so he filled the room,
p136
aVand we had an extraordinary conversation.
p137
aVHe was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do
p138
aVbecause he was famous for being silent,
p139
aVfor never ever saying anything
p140
aVexcept maybe a word or two.
p141
aVAnd, in fact, he did wind up opening up \u2014
p142
aVby the way, his energy is evidenced in other ways.
p143
aVHe subsequently got married again at 102,
p144
aVso he, you know, he had a lot of the life force in him.
p145
aa(lp146
VBut after the interview, I got a call,
p147
aVvery gruff voice, from a woman.
p148
aVI didn't know who she was,
p149
aVand she said, "Did you get George Abbott to talk?"
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd I said, "Yeah. Apparently I did."
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd she said, "I'm his old girlfriend, Maureen Stapleton,
p154
aVand I could never do it."
p155
aVAnd then she made me go up with the tape of it
p156
aVand prove that George Abbott actually could talk.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo, you know, you want energy,
p159
aVyou want the life force,
p160
aVbut you really want them also to think
p161
aVthat they have a story worth sharing.
p162
aVThe worst interviews that you can ever have
p163
aVare with people who are modest.
p164
aVNever ever get up on a stage with somebody who's modest,
p165
aVbecause all of these people have been assembled
p166
aVto listen to them, and they sit there and they say,
p167
aV"Aw, shucks, it was an accident."
p168
aVThere's nothing that ever happens that justifies
p169
aVpeople taking good hours of the day to be with them.
p170
aa(lp171
VThe worst interview I ever did: William L. Shirer.
p172
aVThe journalist who did "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich."
p173
aVThis guy had met Hitler and Gandhi within six months,
p174
aVand every time I'd ask him about it, he'd say, "Oh, I just happened to be there.
p175
aVDidn't matter." Whatever.
p176
aVAwful.
p177
aVI never would ever agree to interview a modest person.
p178
aVThey have to think that they did something
p179
aVand that they want to share it with you.
p180
aa(lp181
VBut it comes down, in the end,
p182
aVto how do you get through all the barriers we have.
p183
aVAll of us are public and private beings,
p184
aVand if all you're going to get from the interviewee is their public self,
p185
aVthere's no point in it.
p186
aVIt's pre-programmed. It's infomercial,
p187
aVand we all have infomercials about our lives.
p188
aVWe know the great lines, we know the great moments,
p189
aVwe know what we're not going to share,
p190
aVand the point of this was not to embarrass anybody.
p191
aVThis wasn't \u2014 and some of you will remember
p192
aVMike Wallace's old interviews \u2014
p193
aVtough, aggressive and so forth. They have their place.
p194
aa(lp195
VI was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say,
p196
aVto break out of their own cocoon of the public self,
p197
aVand the more public they had been,
p198
aVthe more entrenched that person, that outer person was.
p199
aVAnd let me tell you at once the worse moment and the best moment
p200
aVthat happened in this interview series.
p201
aVIt all has to do with that shell that most of us have,
p202
aVand particularly certain people.
p203
aa(lp204
VThere's an extraordinary woman named Clare Boothe Luce.
p205
aVIt'll be your generational determinant
p206
aVas to whether her name means much to you.
p207
aVShe did so much. She was a playwright.
p208
aVShe did an extraordinary play called "The Women."
p209
aVShe was a congresswoman
p210
aVwhen there weren't very many congresswomen.
p211
aVShe was editor of Vanity Fair,
p212
aVone of the great phenomenal women of her day.
p213
aVAnd, incidentally, I call her
p214
aVthe Eleanor Roosevelt of the Right.
p215
aVShe was sort of adored on the Right
p216
aVthe way Eleanor Roosevelt was on the Left.
p217
aVAnd, in fact, when we did the interview \u2014
p218
aVI did the living self-portrait with her \u2014
p219
aVthere were three former directors of the CIA
p220
aVbasically sitting at her feet,
p221
aVjust enjoying her presence.
p222
aa(lp223
VAnd I thought, this is going to be a piece of cake,
p224
aVbecause I always have preliminary talks with these people
p225
aVfor just maybe 10 or 15 minutes.
p226
aVWe never talk before that because if you talk before,
p227
aVyou don't get it on the stage.
p228
aVSo she and I had a delightful conversation.
p229
aa(lp230
VWe were on the stage and then \u2014
p231
aVby the way, spectacular.
p232
aVIt was all part of Clare Boothe Luce's look.
p233
aVShe was in a great evening gown.
p234
aVShe was 80, almost that day of the interview,
p235
aVand there she was and there I was,
p236
aVand I just proceeded into the questions.
p237
aVAnd she stonewalled me. It was unbelievable.
p238
aVAnything that I would ask, she would turn around, dismiss,
p239
aVand I was basically up there \u2014 any of you
p240
aVin the moderate-to-full entertainment world
p241
aVknow what it is to die onstage.
p242
aVAnd I was dying. She was absolutely not giving me a thing.
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd I began to wonder what was going on,
p245
aVand you think while you talk,
p246
aVand basically, I thought, I got it.
p247
aVWhen we were alone, I was her audience.
p248
aVNow I'm her competitor for the audience.
p249
aVThat's the problem here, and she's fighting me for that,
p250
aVand so then I asked her a question \u2014
p251
aVI didn't know how I was going to get out of it \u2014
p252
aVI asked her a question about her days as a playwright,
p253
aVand again, characteristically,
p254
aVinstead of saying, "Oh yes, I was a playwright, and this is what blah blah blah,"
p255
aVshe said, "Oh, playwright. Everybody knows I was a playwright.
p256
aVMost people think that I was an actress. I was never an actress."
p257
aVBut I hadn't asked that, and then she went off on a tear,
p258
aVand she said, "Oh, well, there was that one time that I was an actress.
p259
aVIt was for a charity in Connecticut when I was a congresswoman,
p260
aVand I got up there," and she went on and on, "And then I got on the stage."
p261
aa(lp262
VAnd then she turned to me and said,
p263
aV"And you know what those young actors did?
p264
aVThey upstaged me." And she said, "Do you know what that is?"
p265
aVJust withering in her contempt.
p266
aa(lp267
VAnd I said, "I'm learning."
p268
aa(lp269
V(Laughter)
p270
aa(lp271
VAnd she looked at me, and it was like the successful arm-wrestle,
p272
aVand then, after that, she delivered an extraordinary account
p273
aVof what her life really was like.
p274
aa(lp275
VI have to end that one. This is my tribute to Clare Boothe Luce.
p276
aVAgain, a remarkable person.
p277
aVI'm not politically attracted to her, but through her life force,
p278
aVI'm attracted to her.
p279
aVAnd the way she died \u2014 she had, toward the end, a brain tumor.
p280
aVThat's probably as terrible a way to die as you can imagine,
p281
aVand very few of us were invited to a dinner party.
p282
aa(lp283
VAnd she was in horrible pain.
p284
aVWe all knew that.
p285
aVShe stayed in her room.
p286
aVEverybody came. The butler passed around canapes.
p287
aVThe usual sort of thing.
p288
aVThen at a certain moment, the door opened
p289
aVand she walked out perfectly dressed, completely composed.
p290
aVThe public self, the beauty, the intellect,
p291
aVand she walked around and talked to every person there
p292
aVand then went back into the room and was never seen again.
p293
aVShe wanted the control of her final moment, and she did it amazingly.
p294
aa(lp295
VNow, there are other ways that you get somebody to open up,
p296
aVand this is just a brief reference.
p297
aVIt wasn't this arm-wrestle,
p298
aVbut it was a little surprising for the person involved.
p299
aVI interviewed Steve Martin. It wasn't all that long ago.
p300
aVAnd we were sitting there,
p301
aVand almost toward the beginning of the interview,
p302
aVI turned to him and I said, "Steve," or "Mr. Martin,
p303
aVit is said that all comedians have unhappy childhoods.
p304
aVWas yours unhappy?"
p305
aa(lp306
VAnd he looked at me, you know, as if to say,
p307
aV"This is how you're going to start this thing, right off?"
p308
aVAnd then he turned to me, not stupidly,
p309
aVand he said, "What was your childhood like?"
p310
aa(lp311
VAnd I said \u2014 these are all arm wrestles, but they're affectionate \u2014
p312
aVand I said, "My father was loving and supportive,
p313
aVwhich is why I'm not funny."
p314
aa(lp315
V(Laughter)
p316
aa(lp317
VAnd he looked at me, and then we heard the big sad story.
p318
aVHis father was an SOB,
p319
aVand, in fact, he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood,
p320
aVbut then we were off and running.
p321
aVSo the question is:
p322
aVWhat is the key that's going to allow this to proceed?
p323
aa(lp324
VNow, these are arm wrestle questions,
p325
aVbut I want to tell you about questions
p326
aVthat are more related to empathy
p327
aVand that really, very often, are the questions
p328
aVthat people have been waiting their whole lives to be asked.
p329
aVAnd I'll just give you two examples of this because of the time constraints.
p330
aa(lp331
VOne was an interview I did with one of the great American biographers.
p332
aVAgain, some of you will know him, most of you won't, Dumas Malone.
p333
aVHe did a five-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson,
p334
aVspent virtually his whole life with Thomas Jefferson,
p335
aVand by the way, at one point I asked him,
p336
aV"Would you like to have met him?"
p337
aa(lp338
VAnd he said, "Well, of course,
p339
aVbut actually, I know him better than anyone who ever met him,
p340
aVbecause I got to read all of his letters."
p341
aVSo, he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over 50 years.
p342
aa(lp343
VAnd I asked him one question.
p344
aVI said, "Did Jefferson ever disappoint you?"
p345
aa(lp346
VAnd here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering Jefferson
p347
aVand connecting with him,
p348
aVand he said, "Well ..." \u2014 I'm going to do a bad southern accent.
p349
aVDumas Malone was from Mississippi originally.
p350
aVBut he said, "Well," he said, "I'm afraid so."
p351
aVHe said, "You know, I've read everything,
p352
aVand sometimes Mr. Jefferson would smooth the truth a bit."
p353
aa(lp354
VAnd he basically was saying that this was a man
p355
aVwho lied more than he wished he had,
p356
aVbecause he saw the letters.
p357
aVHe said, "But I understand that." He said, "I understand that."
p358
aVHe said, "We southerners do like a smooth surface,
p359
aVso that there were times when he just didn't want the confrontation."
p360
aa(lp361
VAnd he said, "Now, John Adams was too honest."
p362
aVAnd he started to talk about that, and later on he invited me to his house,
p363
aVand I met his wife who was from Massachusetts,
p364
aVand he and she had exactly the relationship
p365
aVof Thomas Jefferson and John Adams.
p366
aVShe was the New Englander and abrasive,
p367
aVand he was this courtly fellow.
p368
aa(lp369
VBut really the most important question I ever asked,
p370
aVand most of the times when I talk about it,
p371
aVpeople kind of suck in their breath at my audacity, or cruelty,
p372
aVbut I promise you it was the right question.
p373
aVThis was to Agnes de Mille.
p374
aVAgnes de Mille is one of the great choreographers in our history.
p375
aVShe basically created the dances in "Oklahoma,"
p376
aVtransforming the American theater.
p377
aVAn amazing woman.
p378
aa(lp379
VAt the time that I proposed to her that \u2014
p380
aVby the way, I would have proposed to her; she was extraordinary \u2014
p381
aVbut proposed to her that she come on.
p382
aVShe said, "Come to my apartment."
p383
aVShe lived in New York.
p384
aV"Come to my apartment and we'll talk for those 15 minutes,
p385
aVand then we'll decide whether we proceed."
p386
aa(lp387
VAnd so I showed up in this dark, rambling New York apartment,
p388
aVand she called out to me, and she was in bed.
p389
aVI had known that she had had a stroke,
p390
aVand that was some 10 years before.
p391
aVAnd so she spent almost all of her life in bed,
p392
aVbut \u2014 I speak of the life force \u2014
p393
aVher hair was askew.
p394
aVShe wasn't about to make up for this occasion.
p395
aa(lp396
VAnd she was sitting there surrounded by books,
p397
aVand her most interesting possession she felt at that moment
p398
aVwas her will, which she had by her side.
p399
aVShe wasn't unhappy about this. She was resigned.
p400
aVShe said, "I keep this will by my bed, memento mori,
p401
aVand I change it all the time
p402
aVjust because I want to."
p403
aVAnd she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life.
p404
aVI thought, this is somebody I've got to get in this series.
p405
aa(lp406
VShe agreed.
p407
aVShe came on. Of course she was wheelchaired on.
p408
aVHalf of her body was stricken, the other half not.
p409
aVShe was, of course, done up for the occasion,
p410
aVbut this was a woman in great physical distress.
p411
aVAnd we had a conversation,
p412
aVand then I asked her this unthinkable question.
p413
aVI said, "Was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful?"
p414
aa(lp415
VAnd the audience just \u2014 you know,
p416
aVthey're always on the side of the interviewee,
p417
aVand they felt that this was a kind of assault,
p418
aVbut this was the question she had
p419
aVwanted somebody to ask her whole life.
p420
aVAnd she began to talk about her childhood, when she was beautiful,
p421
aVand she literally turned \u2014 here she was, in this broken body \u2014
p422
aVand she turned to the audience and
p423
aVdescribed herself as the fair demoiselle
p424
aVwith her red hair and her light steps and so forth,
p425
aVand then she said, "And then puberty hit."
p426
aa(lp427
VAnd she began to talk about things that had happened
p428
aVto her body and her face,
p429
aVand how she could no longer count on her beauty,
p430
aVand her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one
p431
aVfor whom all the ballet lessons were given.
p432
aVAnd she had to go along just to be with her sister for company,
p433
aVand in that process, she made a number of decisions.
p434
aVFirst of all, was that dance, even though
p435
aVit hadn't been offered to her, was her life.
p436
aVAnd secondly, she had better be,

VCan I get a show of hands \u2014
p5
aVhow many of you in this room have been on a plane in this past year?
p6
aVThat's pretty good.
p7
aVWell, it turns out that you share that experience
p8
aVwith more than three billion people every year.
p9
aVAnd when we put so many people in all these metal tubes
p10
aVthat fly all over the world,
p11
aVsometimes, things like this can happen
p12
aVand you get a disease epidemic.
p13
aa(lp14
VI first actually got into this topic
p15
aVwhen I heard about the Ebola outbreak last year.
p16
aVAnd it turns out that,
p17
aValthough Ebola spreads through these more range-limited,
p18
aVlarge-droplet routes,
p19
aVthere's all these other sorts of diseases
p20
aVthat can be spread in the airplane cabin.
p21
aVThe worst part is, when we take a look at some of the numbers,
p22
aVit's pretty scary.
p23
aVSo with H1N1,
p24
aVthere was this guy that decided to go on the plane
p25
aVand in the matter of a single flight
p26
aVactually spread the disease to 17 other people.
p27
aVAnd then there was this other guy with SARS,
p28
aVwho managed to go on a three-hour flight
p29
aVand spread the disease to 22 other people.
p30
aVThat's not exactly my idea of a great superpower.
p31
aa(lp32
VWhen we take a look at this, what we also find
p33
aVis that it's very difficult to pre-screen for these diseases.
p34
aVSo when someone actually goes on a plane,
p35
aVthey could be sick
p36
aVand they could actually be in this latency period
p37
aVin which they could actually have the disease
p38
aVbut not exhibit any symptoms,
p39
aVand they could, in turn, spread the disease
p40
aVto many other people in the cabin.
p41
aa(lp42
VHow that actually works is that right now
p43
aVwe've got air coming in from the top of the cabin
p44
aVand from the side of the cabin, as you see in blue.
p45
aVAnd then also, that air goes out through these very efficient filters
p46
aVthat eliminate 99.97 percent of pathogens near the outlets.
p47
aVWhat happens right now, though,
p48
aVis that we have this mixing airflow pattern.
p49
aVSo if someone were to actually sneeze,
p50
aVthat air would get swirled around multiple times
p51
aVbefore it even has a chance to go out through the filter.
p52
aVSo I thought: clearly, this is a pretty serious problem.
p53
aa(lp54
VI didn't have the money to go out and buy a plane,
p55
aVso I decided to build a computer instead.
p56
aVIt actually turns out that with computational fluid dynamics,
p57
aVwhat we're able to do is create these simulations
p58
aVthat give us higher resolutions
p59
aVthan actually physically going in and taking readings in the plane.
p60
aVAnd so how, essentially, this works is you would start out
p61
aVwith these 2D drawings \u2014
p62
aVthese are floating around in technical papers around the Internet.
p63
aVI take that and then I put it into this 3D-modeling software,
p64
aVreally building that 3D model.
p65
aVAnd then I divide that model that I just built into these tiny pieces,
p66
aVessentially meshing it so that the computer can better understand it.
p67
aVAnd then I tell the computer where the air goes in and out of the cabin,
p68
aVthrow in a bunch of physics
p69
aVand basically sit there and wait until the computer calculates the simulation.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo what we get, actually, with the conventional cabin is this:
p72
aVyou'll notice the middle person sneezing,
p73
aVand we go "Splat!" \u2014 it goes right into people's faces.
p74
aVIt's pretty disgusting.
p75
aVFrom the front, you'll notice those two passengers
p76
aVsitting next to the central passenger
p77
aVnot exactly having a great time.
p78
aVAnd when we take a look at that from the side,
p79
aVyou'll also notice those pathogens spreading across the length of the cabin.
p80
aa(lp81
VThe first thing I thought was, "This is no good."
p82
aVSo I actually conducted more than 32 different simulations
p83
aVand ultimately, I came up with this solution right here.
p84
aVThis is what I call a \u2014 patent pending \u2014 Global Inlet Director.
p85
aVWith this, we're able to reduce pathogen transmission
p86
aVby about 55 times,
p87
aVand increase fresh-air inhalation by about 190 percent.
p88
aa(lp89
VSo how this actually works
p90
aVis we would install this piece of composite material
p91
aVinto these existing spots that are already in the plane.
p92
aVSo it's very cost-effective to install
p93
aVand we can do this directly overnight.
p94
aVAll we have to do is put a couple of screws in there and you're good to go.
p95
aVAnd the results that we get are absolutely amazing.
p96
aVInstead of having those problematic swirling airflow patterns,
p97
aVwe can create these walls of air
p98
aVthat come down in-between the passengers
p99
aVto create personalized breathing zones.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo you'll notice the middle passenger here is sneezing again,
p102
aVbut this time, we're able to effectively push that down
p103
aVto the filters for elimination.
p104
aVAnd same thing from the side,
p105
aVyou'll notice we're able to directly push those pathogens down.
p106
aVSo if you take a look again now at the same scenario
p107
aVbut with this innovation installed,
p108
aVyou'll notice the middle passenger sneezes,
p109
aVand this time, we're pushing that straight down into the outlet
p110
aVbefore it gets a chance to infect any other people.
p111
aVSo you'll notice the two passengers sitting next to the middle guy
p112
aVare breathing virtually no pathogens at all.
p113
aVTake a look at that from the side as well,
p114
aVyou see a very efficient system.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd in short, with this system, we win.
p117
aVWhen we take a look at what this means,
p118
aVwhat we see is that this not only works if the middle passenger sneezes,
p119
aVbut also if the window-seat passenger sneezes
p120
aVor if the aisle-seat passenger sneezes.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd so with this solution, what does this mean for the world?
p123
aVWell, when we take a look at this
p124
aVfrom the computer simulation into real life,
p125
aVwe can see with this 3D model that I built over here,
p126
aVessentially using 3D printing,
p127
aVwe can see those same airflow patterns coming down,
p128
aVright to the passengers.
p129
aVIn the past, the SARS epidemic actually cost the world
p130
aVabout 40 billion dollars.
p131
aVAnd in the future,
p132
aVa big disease outbreak could actually cost the world
p133
aVin excess of three trillion dollars.
p134
aVSo before, it used to be that you had to take an airplane out of service
p135
aVfor one to two months,
p136
aVspend tens of thousands of man hours and several million dollars
p137
aVto try to change something.
p138
aVBut now, we're able to install something essentially overnight
p139
aVand see results right away.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo it's really now a matter of taking this through to certification,
p142
aVflight testing,
p143
aVand going through all of these regulatory approvals processes.
p144
aVBut it just really goes to show that sometimes the best solutions
p145
aVare the simplest solutions.
p146
aVAnd two years ago, even,
p147
aVthis project would not have happened,
p148
aVjust because the technology then wouldn't have supported it.
p149
aVBut now with advanced computing
p150
aVand how developed our Internet is,
p151
aVit's really the golden era for innovation.
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd so the question I ask all of you today is: why wait?
p154
aVTogether, we can build the future today.
p155
aa(lp156
VThanks.

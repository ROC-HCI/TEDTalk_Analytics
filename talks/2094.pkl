VAmerica's favorite pie is?
p5
aa(lp6
VAudience: Apple. Kenneth Cukier: Apple. Of course it is.
p7
aVHow do we know it?
p8
aVBecause of data.
p9
aVYou look at supermarket sales.
p10
aVYou look at supermarket sales of 30-centimeter pies
p11
aVthat are frozen, and apple wins, no contest.
p12
aVThe majority of the sales are apple.
p13
aVBut then supermarkets started selling
p14
aVsmaller, 11-centimeter pies,
p15
aVand suddenly, apple fell to fourth or fifth place.
p16
aVWhy? What happened?
p17
aVOkay, think about it.
p18
aVWhen you buy a 30-centimeter pie,
p19
aVthe whole family has to agree,
p20
aVand apple is everyone's second favorite.
p21
aV(Laughter)
p22
aVBut when you buy an individual 11-centimeter pie,
p23
aVyou can buy the one that you want.
p24
aVYou can get your first choice.
p25
aVYou have more data.
p26
aVYou can see something
p27
aVthat you couldn't see
p28
aVwhen you only had smaller amounts of it.
p29
aa(lp30
VNow, the point here is that more data
p31
aVdoesn't just let us see more,
p32
aVmore of the same thing we were looking at.
p33
aVMore data allows us to see new.
p34
aVIt allows us to see better.
p35
aVIt allows us to see different.
p36
aVIn this case, it allows us to see
p37
aVwhat America's favorite pie is:
p38
aVnot apple.
p39
aa(lp40
VNow, you probably all have heard the term big data.
p41
aVIn fact, you're probably sick of hearing the term
p42
aVbig data.
p43
aVIt is true that there is a lot of hype around the term,
p44
aVand that is very unfortunate,
p45
aVbecause big data is an extremely important tool
p46
aVby which society is going to advance.
p47
aVIn the past, we used to look at small data
p48
aVand think about what it would mean
p49
aVto try to understand the world,
p50
aVand now we have a lot more of it,
p51
aVmore than we ever could before.
p52
aVWhat we find is that when we have
p53
aVa large body of data, we can fundamentally do things
p54
aVthat we couldn't do when we only had smaller amounts.
p55
aVBig data is important, and big data is new,
p56
aVand when you think about it,
p57
aVthe only way this planet is going to deal
p58
aVwith its global challenges \u2014
p59
aVto feed people, supply them with medical care,
p60
aVsupply them with energy, electricity,
p61
aVand to make sure they're not burnt to a crisp
p62
aVbecause of global warming \u2014
p63
aVis because of the effective use of data.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo what is new about big  data? What is the big deal?
p66
aVWell, to answer that question, let's think about
p67
aVwhat information looked like,
p68
aVphysically looked like in the past.
p69
aVIn 1908, on the island of Crete,
p70
aVarchaeologists discovered a clay disc.
p71
aVThey dated it from 2000 B.C., so it's 4,000 years old.
p72
aVNow, there's inscriptions on this disc,
p73
aVbut we actually don't know what it means.
p74
aVIt's a complete mystery, but the point is that
p75
aVthis is what information used to look like
p76
aV4,000 years ago.
p77
aVThis is how society stored
p78
aVand transmitted information.
p79
aa(lp80
VNow, society hasn't advanced all that much.
p81
aVWe still store information on discs,
p82
aVbut now we can store a lot more information,
p83
aVmore than ever before.
p84
aVSearching it is easier. Copying it easier.
p85
aVSharing it is easier. Processing it is easier.
p86
aVAnd what we can do is we can reuse this information
p87
aVfor uses that we never even imagined
p88
aVwhen we first collected the data.
p89
aVIn this respect, the data has gone
p90
aVfrom a stock to a flow,
p91
aVfrom something that is stationary and static
p92
aVto something that is fluid and dynamic.
p93
aVThere is, if you will, a liquidity to information.
p94
aVThe disc that was discovered off of Crete
p95
aVthat's 4,000 years old, is heavy,
p96
aVit doesn't store a lot of information,
p97
aVand that information is unchangeable.
p98
aVBy contrast, all of the files
p99
aVthat Edward Snowden took
p100
aVfrom the National Security Agency in the United States
p101
aVfits on a memory stick
p102
aVthe size of a fingernail,
p103
aVand it can be shared at the speed of light.
p104
aVMore data. More.
p105
aa(lp106
VNow, one reason why we have so much data in the world today
p107
aVis we are collecting things
p108
aVthat we've always collected information on,
p109
aVbut another reason why is we're taking things
p110
aVthat have always been informational
p111
aVbut have never been rendered into a data format
p112
aVand we are putting it into data.
p113
aVThink, for example, the question of location.
p114
aVTake, for example, Martin Luther.
p115
aVIf we wanted to know in the 1500s
p116
aVwhere Martin Luther was,
p117
aVwe would have to follow him at all times,
p118
aVmaybe with a feathery quill and an inkwell,
p119
aVand record it,
p120
aVbut now think about what it looks like today.
p121
aVYou know that somewhere,
p122
aVprobably in a telecommunications carrier's database,
p123
aVthere is a spreadsheet or at least a database entry
p124
aVthat records your information
p125
aVof where you've been at all times.
p126
aVIf you have a cell phone,
p127
aVand that cell phone has GPS, but even if it doesn't have GPS,
p128
aVit can record your information.
p129
aVIn this respect, location has been datafied.
p130
aa(lp131
VNow think, for example, of the issue of posture,
p132
aVthe way that you are all sitting right now,
p133
aVthe way that you sit,
p134
aVthe way that you sit, the way that you sit.
p135
aVIt's all different, and it's a function of your leg length
p136
aVand your back and the contours of your back,
p137
aVand if I were to put sensors,  maybe 100 sensors
p138
aVinto all of your chairs right now,
p139
aVI could create an index that's fairly unique to you,
p140
aVsort of like a fingerprint, but it's not your finger.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo what could we do with this?
p143
aVResearchers in Tokyo are using it
p144
aVas a potential anti-theft device in cars.
p145
aVThe idea is that the carjacker sits behind the wheel,
p146
aVtries to stream off, but the car recognizes
p147
aVthat a non-approved driver is behind the wheel,
p148
aVand maybe the engine just stops, unless you
p149
aVtype in a password into the dashboard
p150
aVto say, "Hey, I have authorization to drive." Great.
p151
aa(lp152
VWhat if every single car in Europe
p153
aVhad this technology in it?
p154
aVWhat could we do then?
p155
aVMaybe, if we aggregated the data,
p156
aVmaybe we could identify telltale signs
p157
aVthat best predict that a car accident
p158
aVis going to take place in the next five seconds.
p159
aVAnd then what we will have datafied
p160
aVis driver fatigue,
p161
aVand the service would be when the car senses
p162
aVthat the person slumps into that position,
p163
aVautomatically knows, hey, set an internal alarm
p164
aVthat would vibrate the steering wheel, honk inside
p165
aVto say, "Hey, wake up,
p166
aVpay more attention to the road."
p167
aVThese are the sorts of things we can do
p168
aVwhen we datafy more aspects of our lives.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo what is the value of big data?
p171
aVWell, think about it.
p172
aVYou have more information.
p173
aVYou can do things that you couldn't do before.
p174
aVOne of the most impressive areas
p175
aVwhere this concept is taking place
p176
aVis in the area of machine learning.
p177
aVMachine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence,
p178
aVwhich itself is a branch of computer science.
p179
aVThe general idea is that instead of
p180
aVinstructing a computer what do do,
p181
aVwe are going to simply throw data at the problem
p182
aVand tell the computer to figure it out for itself.
p183
aVAnd it will help you understand it
p184
aVby seeing its origins.
p185
aVIn the 1950s, a computer scientist
p186
aVat IBM named Arthur Samuel liked to play checkers,
p187
aVso he wrote a computer program
p188
aVso he could play against the computer.
p189
aVHe played. He won.
p190
aVHe played. He won.
p191
aVHe played. He won,
p192
aVbecause the computer only knew
p193
aVwhat a legal move was.
p194
aVArthur Samuel knew something else.
p195
aVArthur Samuel knew strategy.
p196
aVSo he wrote a small sub-program alongside it
p197
aVoperating in the background, and all it did
p198
aVwas score the probability
p199
aVthat a given board configuration would likely lead
p200
aVto a winning board versus a losing board
p201
aVafter every move.
p202
aVHe plays the computer. He wins.
p203
aVHe plays the computer. He wins.
p204
aVHe plays the computer. He wins.
p205
aVAnd then Arthur Samuel leaves the computer
p206
aVto play itself.
p207
aVIt plays itself. It collects more data.
p208
aVIt collects more data. It increases the accuracy of its prediction.
p209
aVAnd then Arthur Samuel goes back to the computer
p210
aVand he plays it, and he loses,
p211
aVand he plays it, and he loses,
p212
aVand he plays it, and he loses,
p213
aVand Arthur Samuel has created a machine
p214
aVthat surpasses his ability in a task that he taught it.
p215
aa(lp216
VAnd this idea of machine learning
p217
aVis going everywhere.
p218
aVHow do you think we have self-driving cars?
p219
aVAre we any better off as a society
p220
aVenshrining all the rules of the road into software?
p221
aVNo. Memory is cheaper. No.
p222
aVAlgorithms are faster. No. Processors are better. No.
p223
aVAll of those things matter, but that's not why.
p224
aVIt's because we changed the nature of the problem.
p225
aVWe changed the nature of the problem from one
p226
aVin which we tried to overtly and explicitly
p227
aVexplain to the computer how to drive
p228
aVto one in which we say,
p229
aV"Here's a lot of data around the vehicle.
p230
aVYou figure it out.
p231
aVYou figure it out that that is a traffic light,
p232
aVthat that traffic light is red and not green,
p233
aVthat that means that you need to stop
p234
aVand not go forward."
p235
aa(lp236
VMachine learning is at the basis
p237
aVof many of the things that we do online:
p238
aVsearch engines,
p239
aVAmazon's personalization algorithm,
p240
aVcomputer translation,
p241
aVvoice recognition systems.
p242
aVResearchers recently have looked at
p243
aVthe question of biopsies,
p244
aVcancerous biopsies,
p245
aVand they've asked the computer to identify
p246
aVby looking at the data and survival rates
p247
aVto determine whether cells are actually
p248
aVcancerous or not,
p249
aVand sure enough, when you throw the data at it,
p250
aVthrough a machine-learning algorithm,
p251
aVthe machine was able to identify
p252
aVthe 12 telltale signs that best predict
p253
aVthat this biopsy of the breast cancer cells
p254
aVare indeed cancerous.
p255
aVThe problem: The medical literature
p256
aVonly knew nine of them.
p257
aVThree of the traits were ones
p258
aVthat people didn't need to look for,
p259
aVbut that the machine spotted.
p260
aa(lp261
VNow, there are dark sides to big data as well.
p262
aVIt will improve our lives, but there are problems
p263
aVthat we need to be conscious of,
p264
aVand the first one is the idea
p265
aVthat we may be punished for predictions,
p266
aVthat the police may use big data for their purposes,
p267
aVa little bit like "Minority Report."
p268
aVNow, it's a term called predictive policing,
p269
aVor algorithmic criminology,
p270
aVand the idea is that if we take a lot of data,
p271
aVfor example where past crimes have been,
p272
aVwe know where to send the patrols.
p273
aVThat makes sense, but the problem, of course,
p274
aVis that it's not simply going to stop on location data,
p275
aVit's going to go down to the level of the individual.
p276
aVWhy don't we use data about the person's
p277
aVhigh school transcript?
p278
aVMaybe we should use the fact that
p279
aVthey're unemployed or not, their credit score,
p280
aVtheir web-surfing behavior,
p281
aVwhether they're up late at night.
p282
aVTheir Fitbit, when it's able to identify biochemistries,
p283
aVwill show that they have aggressive thoughts.
p284
aVWe may have algorithms that are likely to predict
p285
aVwhat we are about to do,
p286
aVand we may be held accountable
p287
aVbefore we've actually acted.
p288
aVPrivacy was the central challenge
p289
aVin a small data era.
p290
aVIn the big data age,
p291
aVthe challenge will be safeguarding free will,
p292
aVmoral choice, human volition,
p293
aVhuman agency.
p294
aa(lp295
VThere is another problem:
p296
aVBig data is going to steal our jobs.
p297
aVBig data and algorithms are going to challenge
p298
aVwhite collar, professional knowledge work
p299
aVin the 21st century
p300
aVin the same way that factory automation
p301
aVand the assembly line
p302
aVchallenged blue collar labor in the 20th century.
p303
aVThink about a lab technician
p304
aVwho is looking through a microscope
p305
aVat a cancer biopsy
p306
aVand determining whether it's cancerous or not.
p307
aVThe person went to university.
p308
aVThe person buys property.
p309
aVHe or she votes.
p310
aVHe or she is a stakeholder in society.
p311
aVAnd that person's job,
p312
aVas well as an entire fleet
p313
aVof professionals like that person,
p314
aVis going to find that their jobs are radically changed
p315
aVor actually completely eliminated.
p316
aVNow, we like to think
p317
aVthat technology creates jobs over a period of time
p318
aVafter a short, temporary period of dislocation,
p319
aVand that is true for the frame of reference
p320
aVwith which we all live, the Industrial Revolution,
p321
aVbecause that's precisely what happened.
p322
aVBut we forget something in that analysis:
p323
aVThere are some categories of jobs
p324
aVthat simply get eliminated and never come back.
p325
aVThe Industrial Revolution wasn't very good
p326
aVif you were a horse.
p327
aVSo we're going to need to be careful
p328
aVand take big data and adjust it for our needs,
p329
aVour very human needs.
p330
aVWe have to be the master of this technology,
p331
aVnot its servant.
p332
aVWe are just at the outset of the big data era,
p333
aVand honestly, we are not very good
p334
aVat handling all the data that we can now collect.
p335
aVIt's not just a problem for the National Security Agency.
p336
aVBusinesses collect lots of data, and they misuse it too,
p337
aVand we need to get better at this, and this will take time.
p338
aVIt's a little bit like the challenge that was faced
p339
aVby primitive man and fire.
p340
aVThis is a tool, but this is a tool that,
p341
aVunless we're careful, will burn us.
p342
aa(lp343
VBig data is going to transform how we live,
p344
aVhow we work and how we think.
p345
aVIt is going to help us manage our careers
p346
aVand lead lives of satisfaction and hope
p347
aVand happiness and health,
p348
aVbut in the past, we've often looked at information technology
p349
aVand our eyes have only seen the T,
p350
aVthe technology, the hardware,
p351
aVbecause that's what was physical.
p352
aVWe now need to recast our gaze at the I,
p353
aVthe information,
p354
aVwhich is less apparent,
p355
aVbut in some ways a lot more important.
p356
aVHumanity can finally learn from the information
p357
aVthat it can collect,
p358
aVas part of our timeless quest
p359
aVto understand the world and our place in it,
p360
aVand that's why big data is a big deal.

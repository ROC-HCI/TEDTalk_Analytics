VRight when I was 15 was when I first got interested in solar energy.
p5
aVMy family had moved from Fort Lee, New Jersey to California,
p6
aVfrom the snow to lots of heat, and gas lines.
p7
aVThere was gas rationing in 1973.
p8
aVThe energy crisis was in full bore.
p9
aa(lp10
VI started reading "Popular Science" magazine,
p11
aVand I got really excited about the potential of solar energy
p12
aVto try and solve that crisis.
p13
aVI had just taken trigonometry in high school,
p14
aVI learned about the parabola
p15
aVand how it could concentrate rays of light to a single focus.
p16
aVThat got me very excited.
p17
aVAnd I really felt that there would be potential
p18
aVto build some kind of thing that could concentrate light.
p19
aVSo, I started this company called Solar Devices.
p20
aVAnd this was a company where I built parabolas,
p21
aVI took metal shop,
p22
aVand I remember walking into metal shop building parabolas and Stirling engines.
p23
aVAnd I was building a Stirling engine over on the lathe,
p24
aVand all the motorcycle guys said, "You're building a bong, aren't you?"
p25
aVAnd I said, "No, it's a Stirling engine." But they didn't believe me.
p26
aa(lp27
VI sold the plans for this engine
p28
aVand for this dish in the back of "Popular Science" magazine,
p29
aVfor four dollars each.
p30
aVAnd I earned enough money to pay for my first year of Caltech.
p31
aVIt was a really big excitement for me to get into Caltech.
p32
aVAnd at my first year at Caltech, I continued the business.
p33
aVBut then, in the second year of Caltech, they started grading.
p34
aVThe whole first year was pass/fail, but the second year was graded.
p35
aVI wasn't able to keep up with the business,
p36
aVand I ended up with a 25-year detour.
p37
aVMy dream had been to convert solar energy at a very practical cost,
p38
aVbut then I had this big detour.
p39
aVFirst, the coursework at Caltech.
p40
aVThen, when I graduated from Caltech, the IBM PC came out,
p41
aVand I got addicted to the IBM PC in 1981.
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd then in 1983, Lotus 1-2-3 came out,
p44
aVand I was completely blown away by Lotus 1-2-3.
p45
aVI began operating my business with 1-2-3, began writing add-ins for 1-2-3,
p46
aVwrote a natural language interface to 1-2-3.
p47
aVI started an educational software company after I joined Lotus,
p48
aVand then I started Idealab so I could have a roof
p49
aVunder which I could build multiple companies in succession.
p50
aa(lp51
VMuch later \u2014 in 2000, very recently \u2014 the new California energy crisis \u2014
p52
aVwhat was purported to be a big energy crisis \u2014 was coming.
p53
aVAnd I was trying to figure out
p54
aVif we could build something that would capitalize on that
p55
aVand get people backup energy, in case the crisis really came.
p56
aVAnd I started looking at how we could build battery backup systems
p57
aVthat could give people five hours, 10 hours, maybe even a full day,
p58
aVor three days' worth of backup power.
p59
aVI'm glad you heard earlier today, batteries are unbelievably \u2014
p60
aVlack density compared to fuel.
p61
aVSo much more energy can be stored with fuel than with batteries.
p62
aVYou'd have to fill your entire parking space of one garage space
p63
aVjust to give yourself four hours of battery backup.
p64
aVAnd I concluded, after researching every other technology
p65
aVthat we could deploy for storing energy \u2014
p66
aVflywheels, different formulations of batteries \u2014
p67
aVit just wasn't practical to store energy.
p68
aVSo what about making energy? Maybe we could make energy.
p69
aa(lp70
VI tried to figure out \u2014 maybe solar's become attractive.
p71
aVIt's been 25 years since I was doing this,
p72
aVlet me go back and look at what's been happening with solar cells.
p73
aVAnd the price had gone down from 10 dollars a watt
p74
aVto about four or five dollars a watt, but it stabilized.
p75
aVAnd it needed to get much lower to be cost-effective.
p76
aVI studied all the new things that had happened in solar cells,
p77
aVand was looking for ways we could make solar cells more inexpensively.
p78
aVA lot of new things are happening to do that,
p79
aVbut fundamentally, the process requires a tremendous amount of energy.
p80
aVSome people say it takes more energy to make a solar cell
p81
aVthan it will give out in its entire life.
p82
aVIf we reduce the amount of energy it takes to make the cells,
p83
aVthat will become more practical.
p84
aa(lp85
VBut right now, you pretty much have to take silicon,
p86
aVput it in an oven at 1600 F for 17 hours, to make the cells.
p87
aVA lot of people are working to try and reduce that,
p88
aVbut I didn't have anything to contribute.
p89
aVSo I tried to figure out what other way could we try
p90
aVto make cost-effective solar electricity.
p91
aVWhat if we collect the sun with a large reflector \u2014
p92
aVlike I had been thinking about in high school,
p93
aVbut maybe with modern technology we could make it cheaper \u2014
p94
aVconcentrate it to a small converter,
p95
aVand then the conversion device wouldn't have to be as expensive,
p96
aVbecause it's much smaller, rather than solar cells,
p97
aVwhich have to cover the entire surface that you want to gather sun from.
p98
aa(lp99
VThis seemed practical now,
p100
aVbecause a lot of new technologies had come in the 25 years
p101
aVsince I had last looked at it.
p102
aVThere was a lot of new manufacturing techniques,
p103
aVnot to mention really cheap miniature motors \u2014
p104
aVbrushless motors, servomotors, stepper motors,
p105
aVthat are used in printers and scanners.
p106
aVSo, that's a breakthrough.
p107
aVOf course, inexpensive microprocessors
p108
aVand a very important breakthrough \u2014 genetic algorithms.
p109
aa(lp110
VI'll be very short on genetic algorithms.
p111
aVIt's a powerful way of solving intractable problems using natural selection.
p112
aVYou take a problem that you can't solve with a pure mathematical answer,
p113
aVyou build an evolutionary system to try multiple tries at guessing,
p114
aVyou add sex \u2014
p115
aVwhere you take half of one solution and half of another
p116
aVand then make new mutations \u2014
p117
aVand you use natural selection to kill off not-as-good solutions.
p118
aa(lp119
VUsually, with a genetic algorithm on a computer today,
p120
aVwith a three gigahertz processor,
p121
aVyou can solve many formerly intractable problems
p122
aVin just a matter of minutes.
p123
aVSo we tried to come up with a way to use genetic algorithms
p124
aVto create a new type of concentrator.
p125
aVAnd I'll show you what we came up with.
p126
aa(lp127
VTraditionally, concentrators look like this.
p128
aVThose shapes are parabolas.
p129
aVThey take all the parallel incoming rays and focus it to a single spot.
p130
aVThey have to track the sun,
p131
aVbecause they have to point directly at the sun.
p132
aVThey usually have a one degree acceptance angle \u2014
p133
aVonce they're more than a degree off,
p134
aVnone of the sunlight rays will hit the focus.
p135
aVSo we tried to come up with a non-tracking collector
p136
aVthat would gather much more than one degree of light, with no moving parts.
p137
aVSo we created a genetic algorithm to try this out,
p138
aVwe made a model in Excel of a multisurface reflector,
p139
aVand an amazing thing evolved, literally,
p140
aVfrom trying a billion cycles, a billion different attempts,
p141
aVwith a fitness function that defined how can you collect the most light,
p142
aVfrom the most angles, over a day, from the sun.
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd this is the shape that evolved.
p145
aVIt's this non-tracking collector with these six tuba-like horns,
p146
aVand each of them collect light in the following way \u2014
p147
aVif the sunlight strikes right here,
p148
aVit might bounce right to the center, the hot spot, directly,
p149
aVbut if the sun is off axis and comes from the side,
p150
aVit might hit two places and take two bounces.
p151
aVSo for direct light, it takes only one bounce,
p152
aVfor off-axis light it might take two,
p153
aVand for extreme off-axis, it might take three.
p154
aVYour efficiency goes down with more bounces,
p155
aVbecause you lose about 10 percent with each bounce,
p156
aVbut this allowed us to collect light from a plus or minus 25-degree angle.
p157
aVSo, about two and a half hours of the day
p158
aVwe could collect with a stationary component.
p159
aa(lp160
VSolar cells collect light for four and a half hours though.
p161
aVOn an average adjusted day, a solar cell \u2014
p162
aVbecause the sun's moving across the sky,
p163
aVthe solar cell is going down with a sine wave function of performance
p164
aVat the off-axis angles.
p165
aVIt collects about four and a half average hours of sunlight a day.
p166
aVSo even this, although it was great with no moving parts \u2014
p167
aVwe could achieve high temperatures \u2014 wasn't enough.
p168
aa(lp169
VWe needed to beat solar cells.
p170
aVSo we took a look at another idea.
p171
aVWe looked at a way to break up a parabola into individual petals that would track.
p172
aVSo what you see here is 12 separate petals
p173
aVthat each could be controlled with individual microprocessors
p174
aVthat would only cost a dollar.
p175
aVYou can buy a two-megahertz microprocessor for a dollar now.
p176
aVAnd you can buy stepper motors that pretty much never wear out
p177
aVbecause they have no brushes,
p178
aVfor a dollar.
p179
aVSo we can control all 12 of these petals for under 50 dollars
p180
aVand what this would allow us to do is not have to move the focus any more,
p181
aVbut only move the petals.
p182
aa(lp183
VThe whole system would have a much lower profile,
p184
aVbut also we could gather sunlight for six and a half to seven hours a day.
p185
aVNow that we have concentrated sunlight,
p186
aVwhat are we going to put at the center to convert sunlight to electricity?
p187
aVSo we tried to look at all the different heat engines
p188
aVthat have been used in history to convert sunlight or heat to electricity,
p189
aVAnd one of the great ones of all time,
p190
aVJames Watt's steam engine of 1788 was a major breakthrough.
p191
aVJames Watt didn't actually invent the steam engine, he just refined it.
p192
aVBut his refinements were incredible.
p193
aVHe added new linear motion guides to the pistons,
p194
aVhe added a condenser to cool the steam outside the cylinder,
p195
aVhe made the engine double-acting, so it had double the power.
p196
aa(lp197
VThose were major breakthroughs. All of the improvements he made \u2014
p198
aVand it's justifiable that our measure of energy, the watt,
p199
aVtoday is named after him.
p200
aVSo we looked at this engine, and this had some potential.
p201
aVSteam engines are dangerous,
p202
aVand they had tremendous impact on the world \u2014
p203
aVindustrial revolution and ships and locomotives.
p204
aVBut they're usually good to be large,
p205
aVso they're not good for distributed power generation.
p206
aVThey're also very high-pressure, so they're dangerous.
p207
aa(lp208
VAnother type of engine is the hot air engine.
p209
aVAnd the hot air engine also was not invented by Robert Stirling,
p210
aVbut Robert Stirling came along in 1816 and radically improved it.
p211
aVThis engine, because it was so interesting \u2014
p212
aVit only worked on air, no steam \u2014
p213
aVhas led to hundreds of creative designs over the years
p214
aVthat use the Stirling engine principle.
p215
aa(lp216
VBut after the Stirling engine, Otto came along,
p217
aVand also, he didn't invent the internal combustion engine,
p218
aVhe just refined it.
p219
aVHe showed it in Paris in 1867, and it was a major achievement
p220
aVbecause it brought the power density of the engine way up.
p221
aVYou could now get a lot more power in a lot smaller space,
p222
aVand that allowed the engine to be used for mobile applications.
p223
aVSo, once you have mobility,
p224
aVyou're making a lot of engines because you've got lots of units,
p225
aVas opposed to steam ships or big factories,
p226
aVso this was the engine that ended up benefiting from mass production
p227
aVwhere all the other engines didn't.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo, because it went into mass production,
p230
aVcosts were reduced, 100 years of refinement,
p231
aVemissions were reduced, tremendous production value.
p232
aVThere have been hundreds of millions of internal combustion engines built,
p233
aVcompared to thousands of Stirling engines built.
p234
aVAnd not nearly as many small steam engines being built anymore,
p235
aVonly large ones for big operations.
p236
aVSo after looking at these three, and 47 others,
p237
aVwe concluded that the Stirling engine would be the best one to use.
p238
aVI want to give you a brief explanation of how we looked at it and how it works.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo we tried to look at the Stirling engine in a new way,
p241
aVbecause it was practical \u2014
p242
aVweight no longer mattered for our application.
p243
aVThe internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered,
p244
aVbecause you were moving around.
p245
aVBut if you're trying to generate solar energy in a static place
p246
aVthe weight doesn't matter so much.
p247
aa(lp248
VWe also discovered that efficiency doesn't matter so much
p249
aVif your energy source is free.
p250
aVNormally, efficiency is crucial
p251
aVbecause the fuel cost of your engine over its life
p252
aVdwarfs the cost of the engine.
p253
aVBut if your fuel source is free,
p254
aVthen the only thing that matters
p255
aVis the up-front capital cost of the engine.
p256
aVSo you don't want to optimize for efficiency,
p257
aVyou want to optimize for power per dollar.
p258
aa(lp259
VSo using that new twist, with the new criteria,
p260
aVwe thought we could relook at the Stirling engine,
p261
aVand also bring genetic algorithms in.
p262
aVBasically, Robert Stirling didn't have Gordon Moore before him
p263
aVto get us three gigahertz of processor power.
p264
aVSo we took the same genetic algorithm
p265
aVthat we used earlier to make that concentrator,
p266
aVwhich didn't work out for us,
p267
aVto optimize the Stirling engine,
p268
aVand make its design sizes and all of its dimensions
p269
aVthe exact optimum to get the most power per dollar,
p270
aVirrespective of weight, irrespective of size,
p271
aVjust to get the most conversion of solar energy,
p272
aVbecause the sun is free.
p273
aVAnd that's the process we took \u2014 let me show you how the engine works.
p274
aa(lp275
VThe simplest heat engine, or hot air engine, of all time
p276
aVwould be this \u2014 take a box, a steel canister, with a piston.
p277
aVPut a flame under it, the piston moves up.
p278
aVTake it off the flame and pour water on it, or let it cool down,
p279
aVthe piston moves down.
p280
aVThat's a heat engine.
p281
aVThat's the most fundamental heat engine you could have.
p282
aVThe problem is the efficiency is one hundredth of one percent,
p283
aVbecause you're heating all the metal of the chamber
p284
aVand then cooling all the metal of the chamber each time.
p285
aVAnd you're only getting power from the air that's heating at the same time,
p286
aVbut you're wasting energy heating and cooling the metal.
p287
aa(lp288
VSo someone came up with a very clever idea.
p289
aVInstead of heating and cooling the whole cylinder,
p290
aVwhat about if you put a displacer inside \u2014
p291
aVa little thing that shuttles the air back and forth.
p292
aVYou move that up and down with a little bit of energy
p293
aVbut now you're only shifting the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end.
p294
aVSo, now you're not alternately heating and cooling the metal, just the air.
p295
aVThat allows you to get the efficiency up
p296
aVfrom a hundredth of a percent to about two percent.
p297
aa(lp298
VAnd then Robert Stirling came along with this genius idea,
p299
aVwhich was, well, I'm still not heating the metal now,
p300
aVwith this kind of engine,
p301
aVbut I'm still reheating all the air.
p302
aVI'm still heating the air every time and cooling the air every time.
p303
aVWhat about if I put a thermal sponge in the middle,
p304
aVin the passageway between where the air has to move between hot and cold?
p305
aVSo he made fine wires, and cracked glass,
p306
aVand all different kinds of materials to be a heat sponge.
p307
aVSo when the air pushes up to go from the hot end to the cold end,
p308
aVit puts some heat into the sponge.
p309
aVAnd then when the air comes back after it's been cooled,
p310
aVit picks up that heat again.
p311
aVSo you're reusing your energy five or six times,
p312
aVand that brings the efficiency up to between 30 and 40 percent.
p313
aVIt's a little known, but brilliant, genius invention of Robert Stirling
p314
aVthat takes the hot air engine from being somewhat impractical \u2014
p315
aVlike I found out when I made the real simple version in high school \u2014
p316
aVto very potentially possible,
p317
aVonce you get the efficiency up,
p318
aVif you can design this to be low enough cost.
p319
aa(lp320
VSo we really set out on a path to try and make the lowest cost possible.
p321
aVWe built a huge mathematical model of how a Stirling engine works.
p322
aVWe applied the genetic algorithm.
p323
aVWe got the results from that for the optimal engine.
p324
aVWe built engines \u2014
p325
aVso we built 100 different engines over the last two years.
p326
aVWe measured each one, we readjusted the model to what we measured,
p327
aVand then we led that to the current prototype.
p328
aVIt led to a very compact, inexpensive engine,
p329
aVand this is what the engine looks like.
p330
aa(lp331
VLet me show you what it looks like in real life.
p332
aVSo this is the engine. It's just a small cylinder down here,
p333
aVwhich holds the generator inside and all the linkage,
p334
aVand it's the hot cap \u2014 the hot cylinder on the top \u2014
p335
aVthis part gets hot, this part is cool,
p336
aVand electricity comes out.
p337
aVThe exact converse is also true.
p338
aVIf you put electricity in, this will get hot and this will get cold,
p339
aVyou get refrigeration.
p340
aVSo it's a complete reversible cycle,
p341
aVa very efficient cycle, and quite a simple thing to make.
p342
aVSo now you put the two things together.
p343
aa(lp344
VSo you have the engine.
p345
aVWhat if you combine the petals and the engine in the center?
p346
aVThe petals track and the engine gets the concentrated sunlight,
p347
aVtakes that heat and turns it into electricity.
p348
aVThis is what the first prototype of our system looked like
p349
aVwith the petals and the engine in the center.
p350
aVThis is being run out in the sun,
p351
aVand now I want to show you what the actual thing looks like.
p352
aa(lp353
V(Applause)
p354
aa(lp355
VThank you.
p356
aa(lp357
VSo this is a unit with the 12 petals.
p358
aVThese petals cost about a dollar each \u2014
p359
aVthey're lightweight, injection-molded plastic, aluminized.
p360
aVThe mechanism to control each petal is below there,
p361
aVwith a microprocessor on each one.
p362
aVThere are thermocouples on the engine \u2014
p363
aVlittle sensors that detect the heat when the sunlight strikes them.
p364
aVEach petal adjusts itself separately to keep the highest temperature on it.
p365
aVWhen the sun comes out in the morning, the petals will seek the sun,
p366
aVfind it by searching for the highest temperature.
p367
aVAbout a minute and a half or two minutes after the rays are striking the hot cap
p368
aVthe engine will be warm enough to start
p369
aVand then the engine will generate electricity
p370
aVfor about six and a half hours a day \u2014
p371
aVsix and a half to seven hours as the sun moves across the sky.
p372
aa(lp373
VA critical part that we can take advantage of
p374
aVis that we have these inexpensive microprocessors
p375
aVand each of these petals is autonomous,
p376
aVand each of these petals figures out where the sun is with no user setup.
p377
aVSo you don't have to tell what latitude, longitude you're at,
p378
aVwhat your roof slope angle is, or what orientation.
p379
aVIt doesn't really care.
p380
aVWhat it does is it searches to find the hottest spot,
p381
aVit searches again a half an hour later, a day later, a month later.
p382
aVIt basically figures out where on Earth you are
p383
aVby watching the direction the sun moves,
p384
aVso you don't have to actually enter anything about that.
p385
aa(lp386
VThe way the unit works is,
p387
aVwhen the sun comes out, the engine will start
p388
aVand you get power out here.
p389
aVWe have AC and DC, get 12 volts DC,
p390
aVso that could be used for certain applications.
p391
aVWe have an inverter in there, so you get 117 volts AC.
p392
aVAnd you also get hot water. The hot water's optional.
p393
aVYou don't have to use it, it will cool itself.
p394
aVBut you can use it to optionally heat hot water
p395
aVand that brings the efficiency up even higher
p396
aVbecause some of the heat that you'd normally be rejecting,
p397
aVyou can now use as useful energy, whether it's for a pool or hot water.
p398
aa(lp399
VLet me show you a quick movie of what this looks like running.
p400
aVThis is the first test where we took it outside
p401
aVand each of the petals were individually seeking.
p402
aVAnd what they do is step, very coarsely at first,
p403
aVand very finely afterward.
p404
aVOnce they get a temperature reading on the thermocouple
p405
aVindicating they found the sun,
p406
aVthey slow down and do a fine search.
p407
aVThen the petals will move into position, and the engine will start.
p408
aa(lp409
VWe've been working on this for the last two years.
p410
aVWe're very excited about the progress, we have a long way to go though.
p411
aVThis is how we envision it would be in a residential installation:
p412
aVyou'd probably have more than one unit on your roof.
p413
aVIt could be on your roof, your backyard, or somewhere else.
p414
aVYou don't have to have enough units to power your entire house,
p415
aVyou just save money with each incremental one you add.
p416
aa(lp417
VSo you're still using the grid potentially,
p418
aVin this type of application, to be your backup supply \u2014
p419
aVof course, you can't use these at night, and you can't use these on cloudy days.
p420
aVBut by reducing your energy use, pretty much at the peak times \u2014
p421
aVusually when you have your air conditioning on,
p422
aVor other times like that \u2014
p423
aVthis generates the peak power at the peak usage time,
p424
aVso it's very complementary in that sense.
p425
aa(lp426
VThis is how we would envision a residential application.
p427
aVWe also think there's very big potential for energy farms,
p428
aVespecially in remote land where there happens to be a lot of sun.
p429
aVIt's a really good combination of those two factors.
p430
aVIt turns out there's a lot of powerful sun all around the world, obviously,
p431
aVbut in special places
p432
aVwhere it happens to be relatively inexpensive to place these
p433
aVand also in many more places where there is high wind power.
p434
aVSo an example of that is, here's the map of the United States.
p435
aVPretty much everywhere that's not green or blue is a really ideal place,
p436
aVbut even the green or blue areas are good,
p437
aVjust not as good as the places that are red, orange and yellow.
p438
aVBut the hot spot right around Las Vegas and Death Valley is very good.
p439
aVAnd is only affects the payback period,
p440
aVit doesn't mean that you couldn't use solar energy;
p441
aVyou could use it anywhere on Earth.
p442
aVIt just affects the payback period
p443
aVif you're comparing to grid-supplied electricity.
p444
aVBut if you don't have grid-supplied electricity,
p445
aVthen the question of payback is a different one entirely.
p446
aVIt's just how many watts do you get per dollar,
p447
aVand how could you benefit from that to change your life in some way.
p448
aa(lp449
VThis is the map of the whole Earth,
p450
aVand you can see a huge swathe in the middle
p451
aVwhere a large part of the population is,
p452
aVthere's tremendous chances for solar energy.
p453
aVAnd of course, look at Africa.
p454
aVThe potential to take advantage of solar energy there is unbelievable,
p455
aVand I'm really excited to talk more about finding ways we can help with that.
p456
aa(lp457
VSo, in conclusion, I would say my journey has shown me
p458
aVthat you can revisit old ideas in a new light,
p459
aVand sometimes ideas that have been discarded in the past
p460
aVcan be practical now if you apply some new technology or new twists.
p461
aVWe believe we're getting very close to something practical and affordable.
p462
aVOur short-term goal for this is to be half the price of solar cells
p463
aVand our longer-term goal is to be less than a five-year payback.
p464
aVAnd at less than a five-year payback, this becomes very economic.
p465
aVSo you don't have to just have a feel-good attitude about energy
p466
aVto want to have one of these.
p467
aVIt just makes economic sense.
p468
aVRight now, solar paybacks are between 30 and 50 years.
p469
aVIf you get it down below five years,
p470
aVthen it's almost a no-brainer because the interest to own it \u2014
p471
aVsomeone else will finance it for you and you can just make money from day one.
p472
aVSo that's our real powerful goal
p473
aVthat we're really shooting for in the company.
p474
aa(lp475
VTwo other things that I learned that were very surprising to me \u2014
p476
aVone was how casual we are about energy.
p477
aVI was walking from the elevator over here,
p478
aVand even just looking at the stage right now \u2014
p479
aVso there's probably 20,500-watt lights right now.
p480
aVThere's 10,000 watts of light pouring on the stage,
p481
aVone horsepower is 746 watts, at full power.
p482
aVSo there's basically 15 horses running at full speed just to keep the stage lit.
p483
aVNot to mention the 200 horses that are probably running right now
p484
aVto keep the air-conditioning going.
p485
aVAnd it's just amazing,
p486
aVwalk in the elevator, and there's lights on in the elevator.
p487
aVOf course, now I'm very sensitive at home when we leave the lights on by mistake.
p488
aa(lp489
VBut, everywhere around us we have insatiable use for energy
p490
aVbecause it's so cheap.
p491
aVAnd it's cheap because we've been subsidized by energy
p492
aVthat's been concentrated by the sun.
p493
aVBasically, oil is solar-energy concentrate.
p494
aVIt's been pounded for a billion years with a lot of energy
p495
aVto make it have all that energy contained in it.
p496
aVAnd we don't have a birthright
p497
aVto just use that up as fast as we are, I think.
p498
aVAnd it would be great if we could make our energy usage renewable,
p499
aVwhere as we're using the energy, we're creating it at the same pace,
p500
aVand I really hope we can get there.
p501
aa(lp502
VThank you very much, you've been a great audience.

VI want you to put off your preconceptions,
p5
aVyour preconceived fears and thoughts about reptiles.
p6
aVBecause that is the only way I'm going to get my story across to you.
p7
aVAnd by the way, if I come across as a sort of
p8
aVrabid, hippie conservationist,
p9
aVit's purely a figment of your imagination.
p10
aV(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VOkay. We are actually the first species on Earth
p13
aVto be so prolific to actually threaten our own survival.
p14
aVAnd I know we've all seen images enough to make us numb,
p15
aVof the tragedies that we're perpetrating on the planet.
p16
aVWe're kind of like greedy kids, using it all up, aren't we?
p17
aVAnd today is a time for me to talk to you about water.
p18
aVIt's not only because we like to drink lots of it,
p19
aVand its marvelous derivatives, beer, wine, etc.
p20
aVAnd, of course, watch it fall from the sky
p21
aVand flow in our wonderful rivers,
p22
aVbut for several other reasons as well.
p23
aa(lp24
VWhen I was a kid, growing up in New York,
p25
aVI was smitten by snakes, the same way most kids are
p26
aVsmitten by tops, marbles, cars, trains, cricket balls.
p27
aVAnd my mother, brave lady,
p28
aVwas partly to blame,
p29
aVtaking me to the New York Natural History Museum,
p30
aVbuying me books on snakes,
p31
aVand then starting this infamous career of mine,
p32
aVwhich has culminated in
p33
aVof course, arriving in India 60 years ago,
p34
aVbrought by my mother, Doris Norden,
p35
aVand my stepfather, Rama Chattopadhyaya.
p36
aa(lp37
VIt's been a roller coaster ride.
p38
aVTwo animals, two iconic reptiles
p39
aVreally captivated me very early on.
p40
aVOne of them was the remarkable gharial.
p41
aVThis crocodile, which grows to almost 20 feet long
p42
aVin the northern rivers,
p43
aVand this charismatic snake, the king cobra.
p44
aVWhat my purpose of the talk today really is,
p45
aVis to sort of indelibly scar your minds
p46
aVwith these charismatic and majestic creatures.
p47
aVBecause this is what you will take away from here,
p48
aVa reconnection with nature, I hope.
p49
aa(lp50
VThe king cobra is quite remarkable for several reasons.
p51
aVWhat you're seeing here is very recently shot images
p52
aVin a forest nearby here,
p53
aVof a female king cobra making her nest.
p54
aVHere is a limbless animal, capable of gathering a huge mound of leaves,
p55
aVand then laying her eggs inside,
p56
aVto withstand 5 to 10 [meters of rainfall],
p57
aVin order that the eggs can incubate over the next 90 days,
p58
aVand hatch into little baby king cobras.
p59
aVSo, she protects her eggs,
p60
aVand after three months,
p61
aVthe babies finally do hatch out.
p62
aVA majority of them will die, of course. There is very high mortality
p63
aVin little baby reptiles who are just 10 to 12 inches long.
p64
aa(lp65
VMy first experience with king cobras was in '72
p66
aVat a magical place called Agumbe,
p67
aVin Karnataka, this state.
p68
aVAnd it is a marvelous rain forest.
p69
aVThis first encounter
p70
aVwas kind of like the
p71
aVMaasai boy who kills the lion to become a warrior.
p72
aVIt really changed my life totally.
p73
aVAnd it brought me straight into the conservation fray.
p74
aVI ended up starting this research
p75
aVand education station in Agumbe,
p76
aVwhich you are all of course invited to visit.
p77
aa(lp78
VThis is basically a base wherein
p79
aVwe are trying to gather and learn
p80
aVvirtually everything about the biodiversity
p81
aVof this incredibly complex forest system,
p82
aVand try to hang on to what's there,
p83
aVmake sure the water sources are protected and kept clean,
p84
aVand of course, having a good time too.
p85
aVYou can almost hear the drums
p86
aVthrobbing back in that little cottage where we stay when we're there.
p87
aVIt was very important for us to get through to the people.
p88
aVAnd through the children is usually the way to go.
p89
aVThey are fascinated with snakes. They haven't got
p90
aVthat steely thing that you end up
p91
aVeither fearing or hating or despising or loathing them in some way.
p92
aVThey are interested.
p93
aVAnd it really works to start with them.
p94
aVThis gives you an idea of the size of some of these snakes.
p95
aa(lp96
VThis is an average size king cobra, about 12 feet long.
p97
aVAnd it actually crawled into somebody's bathroom,
p98
aVand was hanging around there for two or three days.
p99
aVThe people of this part of India
p100
aVworship the king cobra.
p101
aVAnd they didn't kill it. They called us to catch it.
p102
aVNow we've caught more than 100 king cobras
p103
aVover the last three years,
p104
aVand relocated them in nearby forests.
p105
aa(lp106
VBut in order to find out the real secrets of these creatures
p107
aV[it was necessary] for us to actually insert
p108
aVa small radio transmitter inside [each] snake.
p109
aVNow we are able to follow them and find out their secrets,
p110
aVwhere the babies go after they hatch,
p111
aVand remarkable things like this you're about to see.
p112
aVThis was just a few days ago in Agumbe.
p113
aVI had the pleasure of being close to this large king cobra
p114
aVwho had caught a venomous pit viper.
p115
aVAnd it does it in such a way that it doesn't get bitten itself.
p116
aVAnd king cobras feed only on snakes.
p117
aVThis [little snake] was kind of a tid-bit for it,
p118
aVwhat we'd call a "vadai" or a donut or something like that.
p119
aV(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VUsually they eat something a bit larger.
p122
aVIn this case a rather strange and inexplicable
p123
aVactivity happened over the last breeding season,
p124
aVwherein a large male king cobra actually grabbed a female king cobra,
p125
aVdidn't mate with it, actually killed it and swallowed it.
p126
aVWe're still trying to explain and come to terms with
p127
aVwhat is the evolutionary advantage of this.
p128
aa(lp129
VBut they do also a lot of other remarkable things.
p130
aVThis is again, something [we were able to see] by virtue of the fact
p131
aVthat we had a radio transmitter in one of the snakes.
p132
aVThis male snake, 12 feet long, met another male king cobra.
p133
aVAnd they did this incredible ritual combat dance.
p134
aVIt's very much like the rutting of mammals, including humans,
p135
aVyou know, sorting out our differences, but gentler, no biting allowed.
p136
aVIt's just a wresting match,
p137
aVbut a remarkable activity.
p138
aa(lp139
VNow, what are we doing with all this information?
p140
aVWhat's the point of all this?
p141
aVWell, the king cobra is literally
p142
aVa keystone species in these rainforests.
p143
aVAnd our job is to convince the authorities
p144
aVthat these forests have to be protected.
p145
aVAnd this is one of the ways we do it,
p146
aVby learning as much as we can
p147
aVabout something so remarkable and so iconic in the rainforests there,
p148
aVin order to help protect trees, animals
p149
aVand of course the water sources.
p150
aa(lp151
VYou've all heard, perhaps, of Project Tiger
p152
aVwhich started back in the early '70s,
p153
aVwhich was, in fact, a very dynamic time for conservation.
p154
aVWe were piloted, I could say,
p155
aVby a highly autocratic stateswoman,
p156
aVbut who also had an incredible passion for environment.
p157
aVAnd this is the time when Project Tiger emerged.
p158
aVAnd, just like Project Tiger,
p159
aVour activities with the king cobra
p160
aVis to look at a species of animal
p161
aVso that we protect its habitat and everything within it.
p162
aVSo, the tiger is the icon.
p163
aVAnd now the king cobra is a new one.
p164
aa(lp165
VAll the major rivers in south India
p166
aVare sourced in the Western Ghats,
p167
aVthe chain of hills running along the west coast of India.
p168
aVIt pours out millions of gallons every hour,
p169
aVand supplies drinking water to at least 300 million people,
p170
aVand washes many, many babies,
p171
aVand of course feeds many, many animals,
p172
aVboth domestic and wild,
p173
aVproduces thousands of tons of rice.
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd what do we do? How do we respond to this?
p176
aVWell, basically, we dam it, we pollute it,
p177
aVwe pour in pesticides, weedicides, fungicides.
p178
aVYou drink it in peril of your life.
p179
aVAnd the thing is, it's not just big industry.
p180
aVIt's not misguided river engineers
p181
aVwho are doing all this; it's us.
p182
aVIt seems that our citizens find the best way to dispose of garbage
p183
aVare in water sources.
p184
aVOkay. Now we're going north, very far north.
p185
aa(lp186
VNorth central India, the Chambal River
p187
aVis where we have our base.
p188
aVThis is the home of the gharial, this incredible crocodile.
p189
aVIt is an animal which has been on the Earth
p190
aVfor just about 100 million years.
p191
aVIt survived even during the time that the dinosaurs died off.
p192
aVIt has remarkable features.
p193
aVEven though it grows to 20 feet long,
p194
aVsince it eats only fish it's not dangerous to human beings.
p195
aVIt does have big teeth, however,
p196
aVand it's kind of hard to convince people
p197
aVif an animal has big teeth, that it's a harmless creature.
p198
aa(lp199
VBut we, actually, back in the early '70s,
p200
aVdid surveys,
p201
aVand found that gharial were extremely rare.
p202
aVIn fact, if you see the map,
p203
aVthe range of their original habitat
p204
aVwas all the way from the Indus in Pakistan
p205
aVto the Irrawaddy in Burma.
p206
aVAnd now it's just limited to a couple of spots
p207
aVin Nepal and India.
p208
aVSo, in fact at this point
p209
aVthere are only 200 breeding gharial left in the wild.
p210
aVSo, starting in the mid-'70s
p211
aVwhen conservation was at the fore,
p212
aVwe were actually able to start projects which were
p213
aVbasically government supported
p214
aVto collect eggs from the wild from the few remaining nests
p215
aVand release 5,000 baby gharial
p216
aVback to the wild.
p217
aVAnd pretty soon we were seeing sights like this.
p218
aVI mean, just incredible to see bunches of gharial
p219
aVbasking on the river again.
p220
aa(lp221
VBut complacency does have a tendency to breed contempt.
p222
aVAnd, sure enough, with all the other pressures on the river,
p223
aVlike sand mining, for example,
p224
aVvery, very heavy cultivation all the way down to the river's edge,
p225
aVnot allowing the animals to breed anymore,
p226
aVwe're looking at
p227
aVeven more problems building up for the gharial,
p228
aVdespite the early good intentions.
p229
aVTheir nests hatching along the riverside
p230
aVproducing hundreds of hatchlings. It's just an amazing sight.
p231
aVThis was actually just taken last year.
p232
aVBut then the monsoon arrives,
p233
aVand unfortunately downriver there is always a dam or
p234
aVthere is always a barrage,
p235
aVand, shoop, they get washed down to their doom.
p236
aa(lp237
VLuckily there is still a lot of interest.
p238
aVMy pals in the Crocodile Specialist Group of the IUCN,
p239
aVthe [Madras Crocodile Bank], an NGO,
p240
aVthe World Wildlife Fund,
p241
aVthe Wildlife Institute of India, State Forest Departments,
p242
aVand the Ministry of Environment, we all work together on stuff.
p243
aVBut it's possibly, and definitely not enough.
p244
aVFor example, in the winter of 2007 and 2008,
p245
aVthere was this incredible die-off of gharial, in the Chambal River.
p246
aVSuddenly dozens of gharial appearing on the river, dead.
p247
aVWhy? How could it happen?
p248
aa(lp249
VThis is a relatively clean river.
p250
aVThe Chambal, if you look at it, has clear water.
p251
aVPeople scoop water out of the Chambal and drink it,
p252
aVsomething you wouldn't do in most north Indian rivers.
p253
aVSo, in order to try to find out the answer to this,
p254
aVwe got veterinarians from all over the world
p255
aVworking with Indian vets to try to figure out what was happening.
p256
aVI was there for a lot of the necropsies on the riverside.
p257
aVAnd we actually looked through
p258
aVall their organs and tried to figure out what was going on.
p259
aVAnd it came down to something called gout,
p260
aVwhich, as a result of kidney breakdown
p261
aVis actually uric acid crystals throughout the body,
p262
aVand worse in the joints,
p263
aVwhich made the gharial unable to swim.
p264
aVAnd it's a horribly painful death.
p265
aa(lp266
VJust downriver from the Chambal is the
p267
aVfilthy Yamuna river, the sacred Yamuna river.
p268
aVAnd I hate to be so ironic and sarcastic about it
p269
aVbut it's the truth. It's just one of the filthiest cesspools you can imagine.
p270
aVIt flows down through Delhi, Mathura, Agra,
p271
aVand gets just about every bit of effluent you can imagine.
p272
aVSo, it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial
p273
aVwas something in the food chain,
p274
aVsomething in the fish they were eating.
p275
aVAnd, you know, once a toxin is in the food chain
p276
aVeverything is affected, including us.
p277
aa(lp278
VBecause these rivers are the lifeblood of people all along their course.
p279
aVIn order to try to answer some of these questions,
p280
aVwe again turn to technology,
p281
aVto biological technology, in this case,
p282
aVagain, telemetry, putting radios on 10 gharial,
p283
aVand actually following their movements. They're being watched
p284
aVeveryday as we speak, to try to find out
p285
aVwhat this mysterious toxin is.
p286
aa(lp287
VThe Chambal river is an absolutely incredible place.
p288
aVIt's a place that's famous to a lot of you who know
p289
aVabout the bandits, the dacoits
p290
aVwho used to work up there. And there still are quite a few around.
p291
aVBut Poolan Devi was one [of them]. Which actually Shekhar Kapur
p292
aVmade an incredible movie, "The Bandit Queen," which I urge you to see.
p293
aVYou'll get to see the incredible [Chambal] landscape as well.
p294
aa(lp295
VBut, again, heavy fishing pressures.
p296
aVThis is one of the last repositories of the
p297
aVGanges river dolphin,
p298
aVvarious species of turtles,
p299
aVthousands of migratory birds,
p300
aVand fishing is causing problems like this.
p301
aVAnd now [these] new elements of human intolerance
p302
aVfor river creatures like the gharial
p303
aVmeans that if they don't drown in the net,
p304
aVthen they simply cut their beaks off.
p305
aVAnimals like the Ganges river dolphin
p306
aVwhich is just down to a few left,
p307
aVand it is also critically endangered.
p308
aa(lp309
VSo, who is next? Us?
p310
aVBecause we are all dependent on these water sources.
p311
aVSo, we all know about the Narmada river,
p312
aVthe tragedies of dams, the tragedies of huge projects
p313
aVwhich displace people and wreck river systems
p314
aVwithout providing livelihoods.
p315
aVAnd development just basically going berserk,
p316
aVfor a double figure growth index, basically.
p317
aVSo, we're not sure where this story is going to end,
p318
aVwhether it's got a happy or sad ending.
p319
aVAnd climate change is certainly going
p320
aVto turn all of our theories and predictions on their heads.
p321
aVWe're still working hard at it.
p322
aVWe've got a lot of a good team of people working up there.
p323
aa(lp324
VAnd the thing is, you know, the decision makers,
p325
aVthe folks in power,
p326
aVthey're up in their bungalows and so on in Delhi,
p327
aVin the city capitals. They are all supplied with plenty of water. It's cool.
p328
aVBut out on the rivers there are still millions of people
p329
aVwho are in really bad shape.
p330
aVAnd it's a bleak future for them.
p331
aVSo, we have our Ganges and Yamuna cleanup project.
p332
aVWe've spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it,
p333
aVand nothing to show for it. Incredible.
p334
aVSo, people talk about political will.
p335
aVDuring the die-off of the gharial we did galvanize a lot of action.
p336
aVGovernment cut through all the red tape,
p337
aVwe got foreign vets on it. It was great.
p338
aVSo, we can do it.
p339
aVBut if you stroll down to the Yamuna
p340
aVor to the Gomati in Lucknow,
p341
aVor to the Adyar river in Chennai,
p342
aVor the Mula-Mutha river in Pune,
p343
aVjust see what we're capable of doing to a river. It's sad.
p344
aa(lp345
VBut I think the final note really is
p346
aVthat we can do it.
p347
aVThe corporates, the artists, the wildlife nuts,
p348
aVthe good old everyday folks
p349
aVcan actually bring these rivers back.
p350
aVAnd the final word is
p351
aVthat there is a king cobra looking over our shoulders.
p352
aVAnd there is a gharial looking at us from the river.
p353
aVAnd these are powerful water totems.
p354
aVAnd they are going to disturb our dreams until we do the right thing.
p355
aVNamaste.
p356
aV(Applause)
p357
aa(lp358
VChris Anderson: Thanks, Rom. Thanks a lot.
p359
aVYou know, most people are terrified of snakes.
p360
aVAnd there might be quite a few people here who would be
p361
aVvery glad to see the last king cobra bite the dust.
p362
aVDo you have those conversations with people?
p363
aVHow do you really get them to care?
p364
aa(lp365
VRomulus Whitaker: I take the sort of humble approach,
p366
aVI guess you could say. I don't say that snakes are huggable exactly.
p367
aVIt's not like the teddy bear.
p368
aVBut I sort of \u2014 there is an innocence in these animals.
p369
aVAnd when the average person looks at a cobra
p370
aVgoing "Ssssss!" like that, they say, "My god,
p371
aVlook at that angry, dangerous creature."
p372
aVI look at it as a creature who is totally frightened
p373
aVof something so dangerous as a human being.
p374
aVAnd that is the truth. And that's what I try to get out.
p375
aV(Applause)
p376
aa(lp377
VCA: Now, incredible footage you showed of the viper being killed.
p378
aVYou were saying that that hasn't been filmed before.
p379
aa(lp380
VRW: Yes, this is actually the first time anyone of us knew about it, for one thing.
p381
aVAs I said, it's just like a little snack for him, you know?
p382
aVUsually they eat larger snakes like rat snakes,
p383
aVor even cobras.
p384
aVBut this guy who we're following right now is in the deep jungle.
p385
aVWhereas other king cobras
p386
aVvery often come into the human interface,
p387
aVyou know, the plantations, to find big rat snakes and stuff.
p388
aVThis guy specializes in pit vipers.
p389
aVAnd the guy who is working there with them,
p390
aVhe's from Maharashtra, he said, "I think he's after the nusha."
p391
aV(Laughter)
p392
aVNow, the nusha means the high.
p393
aVWhenever he eats the pit viper he gets this little venom rush.
p394
aV(Laughter)
p395
aa(lp396
VCA: Thanks Rom. Thank you.

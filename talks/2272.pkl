VI'm really excited to share with you
p5
aVsome findings that really surprise me
p6
aVabout what makes companies  succeed the most,
p7
aVwhat factors actually matter the most for startup success.
p8
aa(lp9
VI believe that the startup organization
p10
aVis one of the greatest forms to make the world a better place.
p11
aVIf you take a group of people  with the right equity incentives
p12
aVand organize them in a startup,
p13
aVyou can unlock human potential in a way never before possible.
p14
aVYou get them to achieve  unbelievable things.
p15
aa(lp16
VBut if the startup  organization is so great,
p17
aVwhy do so many fail?
p18
aVThat's what I wanted to find out.
p19
aVI wanted to find out what actually matters most
p20
aVfor startup success.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd I wanted to try  to be systematic about it,
p23
aVavoid some of my instincts and maybe misperceptions I have
p24
aVfrom so many companies I've seen over the years.
p25
aa(lp26
VI wanted to know this
p27
aVbecause I've been starting businesses since I was 12 years old
p28
aVwhen I sold candy at the bus stop in junior high school,
p29
aVto high school, when I made solar energy devices,
p30
aVto college, when I made loudspeakers.
p31
aVAnd when I graduated from college, I started software companies.
p32
aVAnd 20 years ago, I started Idealab,
p33
aVand in the last 20 years, we started more than 100 companies,
p34
aVmany successes, and many big failures.
p35
aVWe learned a lot from those failures.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo I tried to look across what factors
p38
aVaccounted the most for company success and failure.
p39
aVSo I looked at these five.
p40
aVFirst, the idea.
p41
aVI used to think that  the idea was everything.
p42
aVI named my company Idealab for how much I worship
p43
aVthe "aha!" moment when you first come up with the idea.
p44
aVBut then over time,
p45
aVI came to think that maybe the team, the execution, adaptability,
p46
aVthat mattered even more than the idea.
p47
aa(lp48
VI never thought I'd be quoting boxer Mike Tyson on the TED stage,
p49
aVbut he once said,
p50
aV"Everybody has a plan, until they get punched in the face." (Laughter)
p51
aVAnd I think that's so true about business as well.
p52
aVSo much about a team's execution
p53
aVis its ability to adapt to getting punched in the face by the customer.
p54
aVThe customer is the true reality.
p55
aVAnd that's why I came to think
p56
aVthat the team maybe was the most important thing.
p57
aa(lp58
VThen I started looking at the business model.
p59
aVDoes the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues?
p60
aVThat started rising to the top in my thinking
p61
aVabout maybe what mattered most for success.
p62
aa(lp63
VThen I looked at the funding.
p64
aVSometimes companies received intense amounts of funding.
p65
aVMaybe that's the most important thing?
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd then of course, the timing.
p68
aVIs the idea way too early and the world's not ready for it?
p69
aVIs it early, as in, you're in advance and you have to educate the world?
p70
aVIs it just right?
p71
aVOr is it too late, and there's already too many competitors?
p72
aa(lp73
VSo I tried to look very carefully at these five factors
p74
aVacross many companies.
p75
aVAnd I looked across all 100 Idealab companies,
p76
aVand 100 non-Idealab companies
p77
aVto try and come up with  something scientific about it.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo first, on these Idealab companies,
p80
aVthe top five companies \u2014
p81
aVCitysearch, CarsDirect, GoTo, NetZero, Tickets.com \u2014
p82
aVthose all became billion-dollar successes.
p83
aVAnd the five companies on the bottom \u2014
p84
aVZ.com, Insider Pages, MyLife, Desktop Factory, Peoplelink \u2014
p85
aVwe all had high hopes for, but didn't succeed.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo I tried to rank across all  of those attributes
p88
aVhow I felt those companies scored on each of those dimensions.
p89
aVAnd then for non-Idealab companies, I looked at wild successes,
p90
aVlike Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and Youtube and LinkedIn.
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd some failures:
p93
aVWebvan, Kozmo, Pets.com
p94
aVFlooz and Friendster.
p95
aVThe bottom companies had intense funding,
p96
aVthey even had business models in some cases,
p97
aVbut they didn't succeed.
p98
aVI tried to look at what factors actually accounted the most
p99
aVfor success and failure across all of these companies,
p100
aVand the results really surprised me.
p101
aa(lp102
VThe number one thing was timing.
p103
aVTiming accounted for 42 percent
p104
aVof the difference between success and failure.
p105
aVTeam and execution came in second,
p106
aVand the idea,
p107
aVthe differentiability of the idea, the uniqueness of the idea,
p108
aVthat actually came in third.
p109
aa(lp110
VNow, this isn't absolutely definitive,
p111
aVit's not to say that  the idea isn't important,
p112
aVbut it very much surprised me that the idea wasn't the most important thing.
p113
aVSometimes it mattered more when  it was actually timed.
p114
aa(lp115
VThe last two, business model and funding, made sense to me actually.
p116
aVI think business model makes sense to be that low
p117
aVbecause you can start out without a business model
p118
aVand add one later if your customers are demanding what you're creating.
p119
aVAnd funding, I think as well,
p120
aVif you're underfunded at first but you're gaining traction,
p121
aVespecially in today's age,
p122
aVit's very, very easy to get intense funding.
p123
aa(lp124
VSo now let me give you some specific examples about each of these.
p125
aVSo take a wild success like Airbnb that everybody knows about.
p126
aVWell, that company was famously passed on by many smart investors
p127
aVbecause people thought,
p128
aV"No one's going to rent out a space in their home to a stranger."
p129
aVOf course, people proved that wrong.
p130
aVBut one of the reasons it succeeded,
p131
aVaside from a good business model, a good idea, great execution,
p132
aVis the timing.
p133
aa(lp134
VThat company came out right during the height of the recession
p135
aVwhen people really needed extra money,
p136
aVand that maybe helped people overcome
p137
aVtheir objection to renting out their own home to a stranger.
p138
aa(lp139
VSame thing with Uber.
p140
aVUber came out,
p141
aVincredible company, incredible business model,
p142
aVgreat execution, too.
p143
aVBut the timing was so perfect
p144
aVfor their need to get drivers into the system.
p145
aVDrivers were looking for extra money; it was very, very important.
p146
aa(lp147
VSome of our early successes, Citysearch, came out when people needed web pages.
p148
aVGoTo.com, which we announced actually at TED in 1998,
p149
aVwas when companies were looking for cost-effective ways to get traffic.
p150
aVWe thought the idea was so great,
p151
aVbut actually, the timing was probably maybe more important.
p152
aVAnd then some of our failures.
p153
aVWe started a company called Z.com, it was an online entertainment company.
p154
aVWe were so excited about it \u2014
p155
aVwe raised enough money, we had a great business model,
p156
aVwe even signed incredibly great Hollywood talent to join the company.
p157
aVBut broadband penetration was too low in 1999-2000.
p158
aVIt was too hard to watch video content online,
p159
aVyou had to put codecs in your browser and do all this stuff,
p160
aVand the company eventually went out of business in 2003.
p161
aa(lp162
VJust two years later,
p163
aVwhen the codec problem was solved by Adobe Flash
p164
aVand when broadband penetration crossed 50 percent in America,
p165
aVYouTube was perfectly timed.
p166
aVGreat idea, but unbelievable timing.
p167
aVIn fact, YouTube didn't even have a business model when it first started.
p168
aVIt wasn't even certain that  that would work out.
p169
aVBut that was beautifully,  beautifully timed.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo what I would say, in summary,
p172
aVis execution definitely matters a lot.
p173
aVThe idea matters a lot.
p174
aVBut timing might matter even more.
p175
aVAnd the best way to really assess timing
p176
aVis to really look at whether  consumers are really ready
p177
aVfor what you have to offer them.
p178
aVAnd to be really, really honest about it,
p179
aVnot be in denial about any results that you see,
p180
aVbecause if you have something you love, you want to push it forward,
p181
aVbut you have to be very, very honest about that factor on timing.
p182
aa(lp183
VAs I said earlier,
p184
aVI think startups can change the world and make the world a better place.
p185
aVI hope some of these insights
p186
aVcan maybe help you have a slightly higher success ratio,
p187
aVand thus make something great come to the world
p188
aVthat wouldn't have happened otherwise.
p189
aa(lp190
VThank you very much, you've been a great audience.

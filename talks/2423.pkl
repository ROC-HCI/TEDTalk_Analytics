VOur ability to create and sustain economic growth
p5
aVis the defining challenge of our time.
p6
aa(lp7
VOf course there are other challenges \u2014
p8
aVhealth care, disease burdens and pandemics,
p9
aVenvironmental challenges
p10
aVand, of course, radicalized terrorism.
p11
aVHowever,
p12
aVto the extent that we can actually solve the economic growth challenge,
p13
aVit will take us a long way
p14
aVto solving the challenges that I've just elucidated.
p15
aa(lp16
VMore importantly,
p17
aVunless and until we solve economic growth
p18
aVand create sustainable, long-term economic growth,
p19
aVwe'll be unable to address
p20
aVthe seemingly intractable challenges that continue to pervade the globe today,
p21
aVwhether it's health care, education or economic development.
p22
aa(lp23
VThe fundamental question is this:
p24
aVHow are we going to create economic growth
p25
aVin advanced and developed economies like the United States and across Europe
p26
aVat a time when they continue to struggle
p27
aVto create economic growth after the financial crisis?
p28
aa(lp29
VThey continue to underperform
p30
aVand to see an erosion in the three key drivers of economic growth:
p31
aVcapital, labor and productivity.
p32
aVIn particular,
p33
aVthese developed economies continue to see debts and deficits,
p34
aVthe decline and erosion of both the quality and quantity of labor
p35
aVand they also see productivity stalling.
p36
aa(lp37
VIn a similar vein,
p38
aVhow are we going to create economic growth in the emerging markets,
p39
aVwhere 90 percent of the world's population lives
p40
aVand where, on average,
p41
aV70 percent of the population is under the age of 25?
p42
aVIn these countries,
p43
aVit is essential that they grow at a minimum of seven percent a year
p44
aVin order to put a dent in poverty
p45
aVand to double per capita incomes in one generation.
p46
aVAnd yet today,
p47
aVthe largest emerging economies \u2014
p48
aVcountries with at least 50 million people \u2014
p49
aVcontinue to struggle to reach that seven percent magic mark.
p50
aVWorse than that,
p51
aVcountries like India, Russia, South Africa, Brazil and even China
p52
aVare falling below that seven percent number
p53
aVand, in many cases, actually regressing.
p54
aa(lp55
VEconomic growth matters.
p56
aVWith economic growth,
p57
aVcountries and societies enter into a virtuous cycle
p58
aVof upward mobility, opportunity and improved living standards.
p59
aVWithout growth, countries contract and atrophy,
p60
aVnot just in the annals of economic statistics
p61
aVbut also in the meaning of life and how lives are lived.
p62
aVEconomic growth matters powerfully for the individual.
p63
aVIf growth wanes,
p64
aVthe risk to human progress
p65
aVand the risk of political and social instability rises,
p66
aVand societies become dimmer, coarser and smaller.
p67
aa(lp68
VThe context matters.
p69
aVAnd countries in emerging markets
p70
aVdo not need to grow at the same rates as developed countries.
p71
aa(lp72
VNow, I know some of you in this room find this to be a risky proposition.
p73
aVThere are some people here
p74
aVwho will turn around and be quite disillusioned
p75
aVby what's happened around the world
p76
aVand basically ascribe that to economic growth.
p77
aVYou worry about the overpopulation of the planet.
p78
aVAnd looking at the UN's recent statistics and projections
p79
aVthat the world will have 11 billion people on the planet
p80
aVbefore it plateaus in 2100,
p81
aVyou're concerned about what that does to natural resources \u2014
p82
aVarable land, potable water, energy and minerals.
p83
aVYou are also concerned about the degradation of the environment.
p84
aVAnd you worry about how man,
p85
aVembodied in the corporate globalist,
p86
aVhas become greedy and corrupt.
p87
aa(lp88
VBut I'm here to tell you today that economic growth
p89
aVhas been the backbone of changes in living standards
p90
aVof millions of people around the world.
p91
aVAnd more importantly,
p92
aVit's not just economic growth that has been driven by capitalism.
p93
aa(lp94
VThe definition of capitalism, very simply put,
p95
aVis that the factors of production,
p96
aVsuch as trade and industry, capital and labor,
p97
aVare left in the hands of the private sector and not the state.
p98
aa(lp99
VIt's really essential here that we understand
p100
aVthat fundamentally the critique is not for economic growth per se
p101
aVbut what has happened to capitalism.
p102
aVAnd to the extent that we need to create economic growth over the long term,
p103
aVwe're going to have to pursue it with a better form of economic stance.
p104
aa(lp105
VEconomic growth needs capitalism,
p106
aVbut it needs it to work properly.
p107
aVAnd as I mentioned a moment ago,
p108
aVthe core of the capitalist system has been defined by private actors.
p109
aVAnd even this, however, is a very simplistic dichotomy.
p110
aVCapitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad.
p111
aVWhen in practical experience,
p112
aVcapitalism is much more of a spectrum.
p113
aVAnd we have countries such as China,
p114
aVwhich have practiced more state capitalism,
p115
aVand we have countries like the Unites States
p116
aVwhich are more market capitalist.
p117
aa(lp118
VOur efforts to critique the capitalist system, however,
p119
aVhave tended to focus on countries like China
p120
aVthat are in fact not blatantly market capitalism.
p121
aa(lp122
VHowever, there is a real reason and real concern
p123
aVfor us to now focus our attentions on purer forms of capitalism,
p124
aVparticularly those embodied by the United States.
p125
aVThis is really important
p126
aVbecause this type of capitalism
p127
aVhas increasingly been afforded the critique
p128
aVthat it is now fostering corruption
p129
aVand, worse still,
p130
aVit's increasing income inequality \u2014
p131
aVthe idea that the few are benefiting at the expense of the many.
p132
aa(lp133
VThe two really critical questions that we need to address
p134
aVis how can we fix capitalism
p135
aVso that it can help create economic growth
p136
aVbut at the same time can help to address social ills.
p137
aa(lp138
VIn order to think about that framing, we have to ask ourselves,
p139
aVhow does capitalism work today?
p140
aVVery simplistically,
p141
aVcapitalism is set on the basis of an individual utility maximizer \u2014
p142
aVa selfish individual who goes after what he or she wants.
p143
aVAnd only after they've maximized their utility
p144
aVdo they then decide it's important
p145
aVto provide support to other social contracts.
p146
aVOf course, in this system governments do tax,
p147
aVand they use part of their revenues to fund social programs,
p148
aVrecognizing that government's role is not just regulation
p149
aVbut also to be arbiter of social goods.
p150
aVBut nevertheless,
p151
aVthis framework \u2014
p152
aVthis two-stage framework \u2014
p153
aVis the basis from which we must now start
p154
aVto think about how we can improve the capitalist model.
p155
aa(lp156
VI would argue that there are two sides to this challenge.
p157
aVFirst of all,
p158
aVwe can draw on the right-wing policies
p159
aVto see what could be beneficial for us
p160
aVto think about how we can improve capitalism.
p161
aa(lp162
VIn particular,
p163
aVright-leaning policies
p164
aVhave tended to focus on things like conditional transfers,
p165
aVwhere we pay and reward people for doing the things
p166
aVthat we actually think can help enhance economic growth.
p167
aVFor example,
p168
aVsending children to school,
p169
aVparents could earn money for that,
p170
aVor getting their children inoculated or immunized,
p171
aVparents could get paid for doing that.
p172
aa(lp173
VNow, quite apart from the debate
p174
aVon whether or not we should be paying people
p175
aVto do what we think they should do anyway,
p176
aVthe fact of the matter is that pay for performance
p177
aVhas actually yielded some positive results
p178
aVin places like Mexico,
p179
aVin Brazil
p180
aVand also in pilot programs in New York.
p181
aa(lp182
VBut there are also benefits
p183
aVand significant changes underway on left-leaning policies.
p184
aVArguments that government should expand its role and responsibility
p185
aVso that it's not so narrowly defined
p186
aVand that government should be much more of an arbiter
p187
aVof the factors of production
p188
aVhave become commonplace with the success of China.
p189
aVBut also we've started to have debates
p190
aVabout how the role of the private sector
p191
aVshould move away from just being a profit motive
p192
aVand really be more engaged in the delivery of social programs.
p193
aVThings like the corporate social responsibility programs,
p194
aValbeit small in scale,
p195
aVare moving in that right direction.
p196
aVOf course, left-leaning policies have also tended to blur the lines
p197
aVbetween government, NGOs and private sector.
p198
aa(lp199
VTwo very good examples of this are the 19th-century United States,
p200
aVwhen the infrastructure rollout
p201
aVwas really about public-private partnerships.
p202
aVMore recently, of course,
p203
aVthe advent of the Internet has also proven to the world
p204
aVthat public and private can work together for the betterment of society.
p205
aa(lp206
VMy fundamental message to you is this:
p207
aVWe cannot continue to try and solve the world economic growth challenges
p208
aVby being dogmatic and being unnecessarily ideological.
p209
aVIn order to create sustainable, long-term economic growth
p210
aVand solve the challenges and social ills that continue to plague the world today,
p211
aVwe're going to have to be more broad-minded
p212
aVabout what might work.
p213
aa(lp214
VUltimately,
p215
aVwe have to recognize that ideology is the enemy of growth.
p216
aa(lp217
VThank you.
p218
aa(lp219
V(Applause)
p220
aa(lp221
VBruno Giussani: I want to ask a couple of questions, Dambisa,
p222
aVbecause one could react to your last sentence
p223
aVby saying growth is also an ideology,
p224
aVit's possibly the dominant ideology of our times.
p225
aVWhat do you say to those who react that way?
p226
aa(lp227
VDM: Well, I think that that's completely legitimate,
p228
aVand I think that we're already having that discussion.
p229
aVThere's a lot of work going on around happiness
p230
aVand other metrics being used for measuring people's success
p231
aVand improvements in living standards.
p232
aVAnd so I think that we should be open
p233
aVto what could deliver improvements in people's living standards
p234
aVand continue to reduce poverty around the world.
p235
aa(lp236
VBG: So you're basically pleading for rehabilitating growth,
p237
aVbut the only way for that happen
p238
aVwithout compromising the capacity of the earth,
p239
aVto take us on a long journey,
p240
aVis for economic growth
p241
aVsomehow to decouple from the underlying use of resources.
p242
aVDo you see that happening?
p243
aa(lp244
VDM: Well, I think that I'm more optimistic about human ability and ingenuity.
p245
aVI think if we start to constrain ourselves
p246
aVusing the finite, scarce and depleting resources
p247
aVthat we know today,
p248
aVwe could get quite negative
p249
aVand quite concerned about the way the world is.
p250
aa(lp251
VHowever, we've seen the Club of Rome,
p252
aVwe've seen previous claims
p253
aVthat the world would be running out of resources,
p254
aVand it's not to argue that those things are not valid.
p255
aVBut I think, with ingenuity we could see desalination,
p256
aVI think we could reinvest in energy,
p257
aVso that we can actually get better outcomes.
p258
aVAnd so in that sense,
p259
aVI'm much more optimistic about what humans can do.
p260
aa(lp261
VBG: The thing that strikes me
p262
aVabout your proposals for rehabilitating growth
p263
aVand taking a different direction
p264
aVis that you're kind of suggesting to fix capitalism with more capitalism \u2014
p265
aVwith putting a price tag on good behavior as incentive
p266
aVor developing a bigger role for business in social issues.
p267
aVIs that what you're suggesting?
p268
aa(lp269
VDM: I'm suggesting we have to be open-minded.
p270
aVI think it is absolutely the case
p271
aVthat traditional models of economic growth
p272
aVare not working the way we would like them to.
p273
aVAnd I think it's no accident
p274
aVthat today the largest economy in the world, the United States,
p275
aVhas democracy,
p276
aVliberal democracy, as it's core political stance
p277
aVand it has free market capitalism \u2014
p278
aVto the extent that it is free \u2014
p279
aVfree market capitalism as its economic stance.
p280
aVThe second largest economy is China.
p281
aVIt has deprioritized democracy
p282
aVand it has state capitalism, which is a completely different model.
p283
aVThese two countries, completely different political models
p284
aVand completely different economic models,
p285
aVand yet they have the same income inequality number
p286
aVmeasured as a Gini coefficient.
p287
aa(lp288
VI think those are the debates we should have,
p289
aVbecause it's not clear at all
p290
aVwhat model we should be adopting,
p291
aVand I think there needs to be much more discourse
p292
aVand much more humility about what we know and what we don't know.
p293
aa(lp294
VBG: One last question. The COP21 is going on in Paris.
p295
aVIf you could send a tweet
p296
aVto all the heads of state and heads of delegations there,
p297
aVwhat would you say?
p298
aa(lp299
VDM: Again, I would be very much about being open-minded.
p300
aVAs you're aware,
p301
aVthe issues around the environmental concerns
p302
aVhave been on the agenda many times now \u2014
p303
aVin Copenhagen, '72 in Stockholm \u2014
p304
aVand we keep revisiting these issues
p305
aVpartly because there is not a fundamental agreement,
p306
aVin fact there's a schism
p307
aVbetween what the developed countries believe and want
p308
aVand what emerging market countries want.
p309
aVEmerging market countries need to continue to create economic growth
p310
aVso that we don't have political uncertainty in the those countries.
p311
aVDeveloped countries recognize
p312
aVthat they have a real, important responsibility
p313
aVnot only just to manage their CO2 emissions
p314
aVand some of the degradation that they're contributing to the world,
p315
aVbut also as trendsetters in R&D.
p316
aVAnd so they have to come to the table as well.
p317
aVBut in essence, it cannot be a situation
p318
aVwhere we start ascribing policies to the emerging markets
p319
aVwithout developed countries themselves
p320
aValso taking quite a swipe at what they're doing
p321
aVboth in demand and supply in developed markets.
p322
aa(lp323
VBG: Dambisa, thank you for coming to TED. DM: Thank you very much.

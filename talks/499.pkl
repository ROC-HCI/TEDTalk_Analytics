VWhen most people think about the beginnings
p5
aVof AIDS, they're gonna think back to the 1980s.
p6
aVAnd certainly, this was the decade in which we discovered AIDS
p7
aVand the virus that causes it, HIV.
p8
aVBut in fact this virus crossed over into humans many decades before,
p9
aVfrom chimpanzees, where the virus originated, into humans who hunt these apes.
p10
aa(lp11
VThis photo was taken before the Great Depression
p12
aVin Brazzaville, Congo.
p13
aVAt this time, there were thousands of individuals,
p14
aVwe think, that were infected with HIV.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo I have a couple of really important questions for you.
p17
aVIf this virus was in thousands
p18
aVof individuals at this point,
p19
aVwhy was it the case that it took us until 1984
p20
aVto be able to discover this virus?
p21
aVOK now, more importantly,
p22
aVhad we been there in the '40s and '50s, '60s,
p23
aVhad we seen this disease, had we understood
p24
aVexactly what was going on with it, how might that have changed and completely
p25
aVtransformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved?
p26
aa(lp27
VIn fact, this is not unique to HIV. The vast majority of
p28
aVviruses come from animals.
p29
aVAnd you can kind of think of this as a pyramid of this bubbling up of viruses
p30
aVfrom animals into human populations.
p31
aVBut only at the very top of this pyramid do these things become completely human.
p32
aVNevertheless, we spend the vast majority
p33
aVof our energy focused on this level of the pyramid,
p34
aVtrying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings,
p35
aVthat are going to be very very difficult to address \u2014
p36
aVas we've seen in the case of HIV.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo during the last 15 years,
p39
aVI've been working to actually study the earlier interface here \u2014
p40
aVwhat I've labeled "viral chatter," which was a term coined
p41
aVby my mentor Don Burke.
p42
aVThis is the idea that we can study the sort of
p43
aVpinging of these viruses into human populations,
p44
aVthe movement of these agents over into humans;
p45
aVand by capturing this moment,
p46
aVwe might be able to move to a situation where we can catch them early.
p47
aa(lp48
VOK, so this is a picture, and I'm going to show you
p49
aVsome pictures now from the field.
p50
aVThis is a picture of a central African hunter.
p51
aVIt's actually a fairly common picture.
p52
aVOne of the things I want you to note from it
p53
aVis blood \u2014 that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact.
p54
aVThis was absolutely key for us. This is a
p55
aVvery intimate form of connection.
p56
aVSo if we're going to study viral chatter, we need to
p57
aVget to these populations who have intensive contact with wild animals.
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd so we've been studying people like this individual.
p60
aVWe collect blood from them, other specimens.
p61
aVWe look at the diseases, which are in the animals as well as the humans.
p62
aVAnd ideally, this is going to allow us to catch these things
p63
aVearly on, as they're moving over into human populations.
p64
aVAnd the basic objective of this work is not to just
p65
aVgo out once and look at these individuals,
p66
aVbut to establish thousands of individuals
p67
aVin these populations that we would monitor
p68
aVcontinuously on a regular basis.
p69
aVWhen they were sick, we would collect specimens from them.
p70
aa(lp71
VWe would actually enlist them \u2014
p72
aVwhich we've done now \u2014 to collect specimens from animals.
p73
aVWe give them these little pieces of filter paper.
p74
aVWhen they sample from animals,
p75
aVthey collect the blood on the filter paper
p76
aVand this allows us to identify yet-unknown viruses from exactly the right animals \u2014
p77
aVthe ones that are actually being hunted.
p78
aa(lp79
V(Video) Narrator: Deep in a remote region of Cameroon,
p80
aVtwo hunters stalk their prey.
p81
aVTheir names are Patrice and Patee.
p82
aVThey're searching for bush meat;
p83
aVforest animals they can kill to feed their families.
p84
aVPatrice and Patee set out most days to go out hunting
p85
aVin the forest around their homes.
p86
aVThey have a series of traps, of snares that they've set up
p87
aVto catch wild pigs, snakes, monkeys,
p88
aVrodents \u2014 anything they can, really.
p89
aVPatrice and Patee have been out for hours but found nothing.
p90
aVThe animals are simply gone.
p91
aa(lp92
VWe stop for a drink of water.
p93
aVThen there is a rustle in the brush.
p94
aVA group of hunters approach,
p95
aVtheir packs loaded with wild game.
p96
aVThere's at least three viruses
p97
aVthat you know about, which are in this particular monkey.
p98
aa(lp99
VNathan Wolfe: This species, yeah. And there's many many more pathogens
p100
aVthat are present in these animals.
p101
aVThese individuals are at specific risk,
p102
aVparticularly if there's blood contact, they're at risk for transmission
p103
aVand possibly infection with novel viruses.
p104
aa(lp105
VNarrator: As the hunters display their kills, something surprising happens.
p106
aVThey show us filter paper they've used to collect the animals' blood.
p107
aVThe blood will be tested for zoonotic viruses,
p108
aVpart of a program Dr. Wolfe has spent years setting up.
p109
aa(lp110
VNW: So this is from this animal right here,
p111
aVGreater Spot-Nosed Guenon.
p112
aVEvery person who has one of those filter papers has at least,
p113
aVat a minimum, been through our basic health education
p114
aVabout the risks associated with these activities,
p115
aVwhich presumably, from our perspective,
p116
aVgives them the ability to decrease their own risk,
p117
aVand then obviously the risk to their families,
p118
aVthe village, the country, and the world.
p119
aa(lp120
VNW: OK, before I continue, I think it's important to take just a moment
p121
aVto talk about bush meat. Bush meat is the hunting of wild game.
p122
aVOK? And you can consider all sorts of different bush meat.
p123
aVI'm going to be talking about this.
p124
aVWhen your children and grandchildren
p125
aVsort of pose questions to you about this period of time,
p126
aVone of the things they're gonna ask you,
p127
aVis how it was they we allowed some of our closest living relatives,
p128
aVsome of the most valuable and endangered species
p129
aVon our planet, to go extinct because we
p130
aVweren't able to address some of the issues
p131
aVof poverty in these parts of the world.
p132
aa(lp133
VBut in fact that's not the only question they're going to ask you about this.
p134
aVThey're also going to ask you the question
p135
aVthat when we knew that this was the way that HIV entered
p136
aVinto the human population,
p137
aVand that other diseases had the potential to enter like this,
p138
aVwhy did we let these behaviors continue?
p139
aVWhy did we not find some other solution to this?
p140
aVThey're going to say, in regions of profound
p141
aVinstability throughout the world,
p142
aVwhere you have intense poverty, where populations are growing
p143
aVand you don't have sustainable resources like this,
p144
aVthis is going to lead to food insecurity.
p145
aa(lp146
VBut they're also going to ask you probably a different question.
p147
aVIt's one that I think we all need to ask ourselves,
p148
aVwhich is, why we thought the responsibility rested with this individual here.
p149
aVNow this is the individual \u2014 you can see just right up over his right shoulder \u2014
p150
aVthis is the individual that hunted the monkey
p151
aVfrom the last picture that I showed you.
p152
aVOK, take a look at his shirt.
p153
aVYou know, take a look at his face.
p154
aVBush meat is one of the central crises,
p155
aVwhich is occurring in our population right now,
p156
aVin humanity, on this planet.
p157
aVBut it can't be the fault of somebody like this.
p158
aVOK? And solving it cannot be his responsibility alone.
p159
aVThere's no easy solutions,
p160
aVbut what I'm saying to you is that we neglect this problem
p161
aVat our own peril.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo, in 1998, along with my mentors
p164
aVDon Burke and Colonel Mpoudi-Ngole,
p165
aVwe went to actually start this work
p166
aVin Central Africa, to work with hunters
p167
aVin this part of the world.
p168
aVAnd my job \u2014 at that time I was a post-doctoral fellow,
p169
aVand I was really tasked with setting this up.
p170
aVSo I said to myself, "OK, great \u2014
p171
aVwe're gonna collect all kinds of specimens. We're gonna go to all these
p172
aVdifferent locations. It's going to be wonderful."
p173
aVYou know, I looked at the map; I picked out 17 sites;
p174
aVI figured, no problem.
p175
aV(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VNeedless to say, I was drastically wrong.
p178
aVThis is challenging work to do.
p179
aVFortunately, I had and continue to have
p180
aVan absolutely wonderful team of colleagues and collaborators in my own team,
p181
aVand that's the only way that this work can really occur.
p182
aVWe have a whole range of challenges about this work.
p183
aa(lp184
VOne of them is just obtaining trust
p185
aVfrom individuals that we work with in the field.
p186
aVThe person you see on the right hand side is Paul DeLong-Minutu.
p187
aVHe's one of the best communicators that I've really ever dealt with.
p188
aVWhen I arrived I didn't speak a word of French,
p189
aVand I still seemed to understand what it was he was saying.
p190
aVPaul worked for years
p191
aVon the Cameroonian national radio and television,
p192
aVand he spoke about health issues. He was a health correspondent.
p193
aVSo we figured we'd hire this person \u2014 when we got there he could
p194
aVbe a great communicator.
p195
aVWhen we would get to these rural villages, though, what we found out
p196
aVis that no one had television,
p197
aVso they wouldn't recognize his face.
p198
aVBut \u2014 when he began to speak
p199
aVthey would actually recognize his voice from the radio.
p200
aVAnd this was somebody who had incredible
p201
aVpotential to spread aspects of our message,
p202
aVwhether it be with regards to wildlife conservation
p203
aVor health prevention.
p204
aa(lp205
VOften we run into obstacles. This is us coming back from
p206
aVone of these very rural sites,
p207
aVwith specimens from 200 individuals
p208
aVthat we needed to get back to the lab within 48 hours.
p209
aVI like to show this shot \u2014 this is
p210
aVUbald Tamoufe, who's the lead
p211
aVinvestigator in our Cameroon site.
p212
aVUbald laughs at me when I show this photo
p213
aVbecause of course you can't see his face.
p214
aVBut the reason I like to show the shot
p215
aVis because you can see that he's about to solve this problem.
p216
aV(Laughter)
p217
aVWhich \u2014 which he did, which he did.
p218
aVJust a few quick before and after shots.
p219
aVThis was our laboratory before.
p220
aVThis is what it looks like now.
p221
aVEarly on, in order to ship our specimens,
p222
aVwe had to have dry ice. To get dry ice we had to go
p223
aVto the breweries \u2014 beg, borrow, steal to get these folks to give it to us.
p224
aVNow we have our own liquid nitrogen.
p225
aVI like to call our laboratory the coldest place in Central Africa \u2014 it might be.
p226
aVAnd here's a shot of me, this is the before shot of me.
p227
aV(Laughter)
p228
aVNo comment.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo what happened? So during the 10 years that we've been doing
p231
aVthis work, we actually surprised ourselves.
p232
aVWe made a number of discoveries.
p233
aVAnd what we've found is that if you look in the right place,
p234
aVyou can actually monitor the flow
p235
aVof these viruses into human populations.
p236
aVThat gave us a tremendous amount of hope.
p237
aVWhat we've found is a whole range of new viruses in these individuals,
p238
aVincluding new viruses in the same group
p239
aVas HIV \u2014 so, brand new retroviruses.
p240
aVAnd let's face it, any new retrovirus in the
p241
aVhuman population \u2014 it's something we should be aware of.
p242
aVIt's something we should be following. It's not something
p243
aVthat we should be surprised by.
p244
aa(lp245
VNeedless to say in the past
p246
aVthese viruses entering into these rural communities
p247
aVmight very well have gone extinct.
p248
aVThat's no longer the case. Logging roads provide access to urban areas.
p249
aVAnd critically, what happens in central Africa
p250
aVdoesn't stay in Central Africa.
p251
aVSo, once we discovered that it was really possible
p252
aVthat we could actually do this monitoring,
p253
aVwe decided to move this from research, to
p254
aVreally attempt to phase up to a global monitoring effort.
p255
aVThrough generous support and partnership
p256
aVscientifically with Google.org and the Skoll Foundation,
p257
aVwe were able to start the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative
p258
aVand begin work in four different sites
p259
aVin Africa and Asia.
p260
aVNeedless to say, different populations from different parts of the world
p261
aVhave different sorts of contact.
p262
aVSo it's not just hunters in Central Africa.
p263
aVIt's also working in live animal markets \u2014
p264
aVthese wet markets \u2014 which is exactly the place where
p265
aVSARS emerged in Asia.
p266
aVBut really, this is just the beginning from our perspective.
p267
aa(lp268
VOur objective right now, in addition to
p269
aVdeploying to these sites and getting everything moving,
p270
aVis to identify new partners
p271
aVbecause we feel like this effort needs to be extended
p272
aVto probably 20 or more sites throughout the world \u2014 to viral hotspots \u2014
p273
aVbecause really the idea here is to cast an incredibly wide net
p274
aVso that we can catch these things, ideally,
p275
aVbefore they make it to blood banks,
p276
aVsexual networks, airplanes. And that's really our objective.
p277
aVThere was a time not very long ago
p278
aVwhen the discovery of unknown organisms
p279
aVwas something that held incredible awe for us.
p280
aVIt had potential to really change the way that we saw ourselves,
p281
aVand thought about ourselves.
p282
aa(lp283
VMany people, I think, on our planet right now
p284
aVdespair, and they think
p285
aVwe've reached a point where we've discovered most of the things.
p286
aVI'm going tell you right now: please don't despair.
p287
aVIf an intelligent extra-terrestrial
p288
aVwas taxed with writing the encyclopedia of life on our planet,
p289
aV27 out of 30 of these volumes
p290
aVwould be devoted to bacteria and virus,
p291
aVwith just a few of the volumes left
p292
aVfor plants, fungus and animals,
p293
aVhumans being a footnote;
p294
aVinteresting footnote but a footnote nonetheless.
p295
aVThis is honestly the most exciting period
p296
aVever for the study of unknown life forms on our planet.
p297
aVThe dominant things that exist here
p298
aVwe know almost nothing about.
p299
aVAnd yet finally, we have the tools, which will allow us to actually explore that world
p300
aVand understand them.
p301
aa(lp302
VThank you very much.

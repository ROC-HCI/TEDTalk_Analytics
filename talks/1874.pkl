VTechnology can change our understanding of nature.
p5
aa(lp6
VTake for example the case of lions.
p7
aVFor centuries, it's been said that female lions
p8
aVdo all of the hunting out in the open savanna,
p9
aVand male lions do nothing until it's time for dinner.
p10
aVYou've heard this too, I can tell.
p11
aVWell recently, I led an airborne mapping campaign
p12
aVin the Kruger National Park in South Africa.
p13
aVOur colleagues put GPS tracking collars
p14
aVon male and female lions,
p15
aVand we mapped their hunting behavior
p16
aVfrom the air.
p17
aVThe lower left shows a lion sizing up
p18
aVa herd of impala for a kill,
p19
aVand the right shows what I call
p20
aVthe lion viewshed.
p21
aVThat's how far the lion can see in all directions
p22
aVuntil his or her view is obstructed by vegetation.
p23
aVAnd what we found
p24
aVis that male lions are not the lazy hunters
p25
aVwe thought them to be.
p26
aVThey just use a different strategy.
p27
aVWhereas the female lions hunt
p28
aVout in the open savanna
p29
aVover long distances, usually during the day,
p30
aVmale lions use an ambush strategy
p31
aVin dense vegetation, and often at night.
p32
aVThis video shows the actual hunting viewsheds
p33
aVof male lions on the left
p34
aVand females on the right.
p35
aVRed and darker colors show more dense vegetation,
p36
aVand the white are wide open spaces.
p37
aVAnd this is the viewshed right literally at the eye level
p38
aVof hunting male and female lions.
p39
aVAll of a sudden, you get a very clear understanding
p40
aVof the very spooky conditions under which
p41
aVmale lions do their hunting.
p42
aa(lp43
VI bring up this example to begin,
p44
aVbecause it emphasizes how little we know about nature.
p45
aVThere's been a huge amount of work done so far
p46
aVto try to slow down our losses of tropical forests,
p47
aVand we are losing our forests at a rapid rate,
p48
aVas shown in red on the slide.
p49
aVI find it ironic that we're doing so much,
p50
aVyet these areas are fairly unknown to science.
p51
aVSo how can we save what we don't understand?
p52
aa(lp53
VNow I'm a global ecologist and an Earth explorer
p54
aVwith a background in physics and chemistry
p55
aVand biology and a lot of other boring subjects,
p56
aVbut above all, I'm obsessed with what we don't know
p57
aVabout our planet.
p58
aVSo I created this,
p59
aVthe Carnegie Airborne Observatory, or CAO.
p60
aVIt may look like a plane with a fancy paint job,
p61
aVbut I packed it with over 1,000 kilos
p62
aVof high-tech sensors, computers,
p63
aVand a very motivated staff
p64
aVof Earth scientists and pilots.
p65
aVTwo of our instruments are very unique:
p66
aVone is called an imaging spectrometer
p67
aVthat can actually measure the chemical composition
p68
aVof plants as we fly over them.
p69
aVAnother one is a set of lasers,
p70
aVvery high-powered lasers,
p71
aVthat fire out of the bottom of the plane,
p72
aVsweeping across the ecosystem
p73
aVand measuring it at nearly 500,000 times per second
p74
aVin high-resolution 3D.
p75
aVHere's an image of the Golden Gate Bridge
p76
aVin San Francisco, not far from where I live.
p77
aVAlthough we flew straight over this bridge,
p78
aVwe imaged it in 3D, captured its color
p79
aVin just a few seconds.
p80
aVBut the real power of the CAO
p81
aVis its ability to capture the actual building blocks
p82
aVof ecosystems.
p83
aVThis is a small town in the Amazon,
p84
aVimaged with the CAO.
p85
aVWe can slice through our data
p86
aVand see, for example, the 3D structure
p87
aVof the vegetation and the buildings,
p88
aVor we can use the chemical information
p89
aVto actually figure out how fast the plants are growing
p90
aVas we fly over them.
p91
aVThe hottest pinks are the fastest-growing plants.
p92
aVAnd we can see biodiversity in ways
p93
aVthat you never could have imagined.
p94
aVThis is what a rainforest might look like
p95
aVas you fly over it in a hot air balloon.
p96
aVThis is how we see a rainforest,
p97
aVin kaleidoscopic color that tells us
p98
aVthat there are many species living with one another.
p99
aVBut you have to remember that these trees
p100
aVare literally bigger than whales,
p101
aVand what that means is that they're impossible to understand
p102
aVjust by walking on the ground below them.
p103
aVSo our imagery is 3D, it's chemical, it's biological,
p104
aVand this tells us not only the species
p105
aVthat are living in the canopy,
p106
aVbut it tells us a lot of information
p107
aVabout the rest of the species that occupy the rainforest.
p108
aa(lp109
VNow I created the CAO
p110
aVin order to answer questions that have proven
p111
aVextremely challenging to answer from any other vantage point,
p112
aVsuch as from the ground, or from satellite sensors.
p113
aVI want to share three of those questions with you today.
p114
aVThe first questions is,
p115
aVhow do we manage our carbon reserves
p116
aVin tropical forests?
p117
aVTropical forests contain a huge amount of carbon in the trees,
p118
aVand we need to keep that carbon in those forests
p119
aVif we're going to avoid any further global warming.
p120
aVUnfortunately, global carbon emissions
p121
aVfrom deforestation
p122
aVnow equals the global transportation sector.
p123
aVThat's all ships, airplanes, trains  and automobiles combined.
p124
aVSo it's understandable that policy negotiators
p125
aVhave been working hard to reduce deforestation,
p126
aVbut they're doing it on landscapes
p127
aVthat are hardly known to science.
p128
aVIf you don't know where the carbon is exactly,
p129
aVin detail, how can you know what you're losing?
p130
aVBasically, we need a high-tech accounting system.
p131
aVWith our system, we're able to see the carbon stocks
p132
aVof tropical forests in utter detail.
p133
aVThe red shows, obviously, closed-canopy tropical forest,
p134
aVand then you see the cookie cutting,
p135
aVor the cutting of the forest in yellows and greens.
p136
aVIt's like cutting a cake except this cake
p137
aVis about whale deep.
p138
aVAnd yet, we can zoom in and see the forest
p139
aVand the trees at the same time.
p140
aVAnd what's amazing is, even though we flew
p141
aVvery high above this forest,
p142
aVlater on in analysis, we can go in
p143
aVand actually experience the treetrops,
p144
aVleaf by leaf, branch by branch,
p145
aVjust as the other species that live in this forest
p146
aVexperience it along with the trees themselves.
p147
aa(lp148
VWe've been using the technology to explore
p149
aVand to actually put out the first carbon geographies
p150
aVin high resolution
p151
aVin faraway places like the Amazon Basin
p152
aVand not-so-faraway places like the United States
p153
aVand Central America.
p154
aVWhat I'm going to do is I'm going to take you on a high-resolution, first-time tour
p155
aVof the carbon landscapes of Peru and then Panama.
p156
aVThe colors are going to be going from red to blue.
p157
aVRed is extremely high carbon stocks,
p158
aVyour largest cathedral forests you can imagine,
p159
aVand blue are very low carbon stocks.
p160
aVAnd let me tell you, Peru alone is an amazing place,
p161
aVtotally unknown in terms of its carbon geography
p162
aVuntil today.
p163
aVWe can fly to this area in northern Peru
p164
aVand see super high carbon stocks in red,
p165
aVand the Amazon River and floodplain
p166
aVcutting right through it.
p167
aVWe can go to an area of utter devastation
p168
aVcaused by deforestation in blue,
p169
aVand the virus of deforestation spreading out in orange.
p170
aVWe can also fly to the southern Andes
p171
aVto see the tree line and see exactly how
p172
aVthe carbon geography ends
p173
aVas we go up into the mountain system.
p174
aVAnd we can go to the biggest swamp in the western Amazon.
p175
aVIt's a watery dreamworld
p176
aVakin to Jim Cameron's "Avatar."
p177
aVWe can go to one of the smallest tropical countries,
p178
aVPanama, and see also a huge range
p179
aVof carbon variation,
p180
aVfrom high in red to low in blue.
p181
aVUnfortunately, most of the carbon is lost in the lowlands,
p182
aVbut what you see that's left,
p183
aVin terms of high carbon stocks in greens and reds,
p184
aVis the stuff that's up in the mountains.
p185
aVOne interesting exception to this
p186
aVis right in the middle of your screen.
p187
aVYou're seeing the buffer zone around the Panama Canal.
p188
aVThat's in the reds and yellows.
p189
aVThe canal authorities are using force
p190
aVto protect their watershed and global commerce.
p191
aVThis kind of carbon mapping
p192
aVhas transformed conservation
p193
aVand resource policy development.
p194
aVIt's really advancing our ability to save forests
p195
aVand to curb climate change.
p196
aa(lp197
VMy second question: How do we prepare for climate change
p198
aVin a place like the Amazon rainforest?
p199
aVLet me tell you, I spend a lot of time
p200
aVin these places, and we're seeing the climate changing already.
p201
aVTemperatures are increasing,
p202
aVand what's really happening is we're getting a lot of droughts,
p203
aVrecurring droughts.
p204
aVThe 2010 mega-drought is shown here
p205
aVwith red showing an area about the size of Western Europe.
p206
aVThe Amazon was so dry in 2010
p207
aVthat even the main stem of the Amazon river itself
p208
aVdried up partially, as you see in the photo
p209
aVin the lower portion of the slide.
p210
aVWhat we found is that in very remote areas,
p211
aVthese droughts are having a big negative impact
p212
aVon tropical forests.
p213
aVFor example, these are all of the dead trees in red
p214
aVthat suffered mortality following the 2010 drought.
p215
aVThis area happens to be on the border
p216
aVof Peru and Brazil,
p217
aVtotally unexplored,
p218
aValmost totally unknown scientifically.
p219
aa(lp220
VSo what we think, as Earth scientists,
p221
aVis species are going to have to migrate
p222
aVwith climate change from the east in Brazil
p223
aVall the way west into the Andes
p224
aVand up into the mountains
p225
aVin order to minimize their exposure to climate change.
p226
aVOne of the problems with this is that humans
p227
aVare taking apart the western Amazon as we speak.
p228
aVLook at this 100-square-kilometer gash
p229
aVin the forest created by gold miners.
p230
aVYou see the forest in green in 3D,
p231
aVand you see the effects of gold mining
p232
aVdown below the soil surface.
p233
aVSpecies have nowhere to migrate in a system like this, obviously.
p234
aa(lp235
VIf you haven't been to the Amazon, you should go.
p236
aVIt's an amazing experience every time,
p237
aVno matter where you go.
p238
aVYou're going to probably see it this way, on a river.
p239
aVBut what happens is a lot of times
p240
aVthe rivers hide what's really going on
p241
aVback in the forest itself.
p242
aVWe flew over this same river,
p243
aVimaged the system in 3D.
p244
aVThe forest is on the left.
p245
aVAnd then we can digitally remove the forest
p246
aVand see what's going on below the canopy.
p247
aVAnd in this case, we found gold mining activity,
p248
aVall of it illegal,
p249
aVset back away from the river's edge,
p250
aVas you'll see in those strange pockmarks
p251
aVcoming up on your screen on the right.
p252
aVDon't worry, we're working with the authorities
p253
aVto deal with this and many, many other problems
p254
aVin the region.
p255
aa(lp256
VSo in order to put together a conservation plan
p257
aVfor these unique, important corridors
p258
aVlike the western Amazon and the Andes Amazon corridor,
p259
aVwe have to start making
p260
aVgeographically explicit plans now.
p261
aVHow do we do that if we don't know the geography of biodiversity in the region,
p262
aVif it's so unknown to science?
p263
aVSo what we've been doing is using
p264
aVthe laser-guided spectroscopy from the CAO
p265
aVto map for the first time the biodiversity
p266
aVof the Amazon rainforest.
p267
aVHere you see actual data showing different species in different colors.
p268
aVReds are one type of species, blues are another,
p269
aVand greens are yet another.
p270
aVAnd when we take this together and scale up
p271
aVto the regional level,
p272
aVwe get a completely new geography
p273
aVof biodiversity unknown prior to this work.
p274
aVThis tells us where the big biodiversity changes
p275
aVoccur from habitat to habitat,
p276
aVand that's really important because it tells us
p277
aVa lot about where species may migrate to
p278
aVand migrate from as the climate shifts.
p279
aVAnd this is the pivotal information that's needed
p280
aVby decision makers to develop protected areas
p281
aVin the context of their regional development plans.
p282
aa(lp283
VAnd third and final question is,
p284
aVhow do we manage biodiversity on a planet
p285
aVof protected ecosystems?
p286
aVThe example I started out with about lions hunting,
p287
aVthat was a study we did
p288
aVbehind the fence line of a protected area
p289
aVin South Africa.
p290
aVAnd the truth is, much of Africa's nature
p291
aVis going to persist into the future
p292
aVin protected areas like I show in blue on the screen.
p293
aVThis puts incredible pressure and responsibility
p294
aVon park management.
p295
aVThey need to do and make decisions
p296
aVthat will benefit all of the species that they're protecting.
p297
aVSome of their decisions have really big impacts.
p298
aVFor example, how much and where
p299
aVto use fire as a management tool?
p300
aVOr, how to deal with a large species like elephants,
p301
aVwhich may, if their populations get too large,
p302
aVhave a negative impact on the ecosystem
p303
aVand on other species.
p304
aVAnd let me tell you, these types of dynamics
p305
aVreally play out on the landscape.
p306
aVIn the foreground is an area with lots of fire
p307
aVand lots of elephants:
p308
aVwide open savanna in blue, and just a few trees.
p309
aVAs we cross this fence line, now we're getting
p310
aVinto an area that has had protection from fire
p311
aVand zero elephants:
p312
aVdense vegetation, a radically different ecosystem.
p313
aVAnd in a place like Kruger,
p314
aVthe soaring elephant densities
p315
aVare a real problem.
p316
aVI know it's a sensitive issue for many of you,
p317
aVand there are no easy answers with this.
p318
aVBut what's good is that the technology we've developed
p319
aVand we're working with in South Africa, for example,
p320
aVis allowing us to map every single tree in the savanna,
p321
aVand then through repeat flights
p322
aVwe're able to see which trees
p323
aVare being pushed over by elephants,
p324
aVin the red as you see on the screen, and how much that's happening
p325
aVin different types of landscapes in the savanna.
p326
aVThat's giving park managers
p327
aVa very first opportunity to use
p328
aVtactical management strategies that are more nuanced
p329
aVand don't lead to those extremes that I just showed you.
p330
aVSo really, the way we're looking
p331
aVat protected areas nowadays
p332
aVis to think of it as tending to a circle of life,
p333
aVwhere we have fire management,
p334
aVelephant management, those impacts on the structure of the ecosystem,
p335
aVand then those impacts
p336
aVaffecting everything from insects
p337
aVup to apex predators like lions.
p338
aa(lp339
VGoing forward, I plan to greatly expand
p340
aVthe airborne observatory.
p341
aVI'm hoping to actually put the technology into orbit
p342
aVso we can manage the entire planet
p343
aVwith technologies like this.
p344
aVUntil then, you're going to find me flying
p345
aVin some remote place that you've never heard of.
p346
aVI just want to end by saying that technology is
p347
aVabsolutely critical to managing our planet,
p348
aVbut even more important is the understanding
p349
aVand wisdom to apply it.
p350
aa(lp351
VThank you.

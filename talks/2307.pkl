(lp4
VSeventy-thousand years ago, our ancestors were insignificant animals.
p5
aVThe most important thing to know about prehistoric humans
p6
aVis that they were unimportant.
p7
aVTheir impact on the world was not much greater than that of jellyfish
p8
aVor fireflies or woodpeckers.
p9
aVToday, in contrast, we control this planet.
p10
aVAnd the question is:
p11
aVHow did we come from there to here?
p12
aVHow did we turn ourselves from insignificant apes,
p13
aVminding their own business in a corner of Africa,
p14
aVinto the rulers of planet Earth?
p15
aa(lp16
VUsually, we look for the difference between us and all the other animals
p17
aVon the individual level.
p18
aVWe want to believe \u2014 I want to believe \u2014
p19
aVthat there is something special about me,
p20
aVabout my body, about my brain,
p21
aVthat makes me so superior to a dog or a pig, or a chimpanzee.
p22
aVBut the truth is that, on the individual level,
p23
aVI'm embarrassingly similar to a chimpanzee.
p24
aVAnd if you take me and a chimpanzee and put us together on some lonely island,
p25
aVand we had to struggle for survival to see who survives better,
p26
aVI would definitely place my bet on the chimpanzee, not on myself.
p27
aVAnd this is not something wrong with me personally.
p28
aVI guess if they took almost any one of you, and placed you alone
p29
aVwith a chimpanzee on some island,
p30
aVthe chimpanzee would do much better.
p31
aa(lp32
VThe real difference between humans and all other animals
p33
aVis not on the individual level;
p34
aVit's on the collective level.
p35
aVHumans control the planet because they are the only animals
p36
aVthat can cooperate both flexibly and in very large numbers.
p37
aVNow, there are other animals \u2014
p38
aVlike the social insects, the bees, the ants \u2014
p39
aVthat can cooperate in large numbers, but they don't do so flexibly.
p40
aVTheir cooperation is very rigid.
p41
aVThere is basically just one way in which a beehive can function.
p42
aVAnd if there's a new opportunity or a new danger,
p43
aVthe bees cannot reinvent the social system overnight.
p44
aVThey cannot, for example, execute the queen
p45
aVand establish a republic of bees,
p46
aVor a communist dictatorship of worker bees.
p47
aa(lp48
VOther animals, like the social mammals \u2014
p49
aVthe wolves, the elephants, the dolphins, the chimpanzees \u2014
p50
aVthey can cooperate much more flexibly,
p51
aVbut they do so only in small numbers,
p52
aVbecause cooperation among chimpanzees
p53
aVis based on intimate knowledge, one of the other.
p54
aVI'm a chimpanzee and you're a chimpanzee,
p55
aVand I want to cooperate with you.
p56
aVI need to know you personally.
p57
aVWhat kind of chimpanzee are you?
p58
aVAre you a nice chimpanzee?
p59
aVAre you an evil chimpanzee?
p60
aVAre you trustworthy?
p61
aVIf I don't know you, how can I cooperate with you?
p62
aa(lp63
VThe only animal that can combine the two abilities together
p64
aVand cooperate both flexibly and still do so in very large numbers
p65
aVis us, Homo sapiens.
p66
aVOne versus one, or even 10 versus 10,
p67
aVchimpanzees might be better than us.
p68
aVBut, if you pit 1,000 humans against 1,000 chimpanzees,
p69
aVthe humans will win easily, for the simple reason
p70
aVthat a thousand chimpanzees cannot cooperate at all.
p71
aVAnd if you now try to cram 100,000 chimpanzees
p72
aVinto Oxford Street, or into Wembley Stadium,
p73
aVor Tienanmen Square or the Vatican,
p74
aVyou will get chaos, complete chaos.
p75
aVJust imagine Wembley Stadium with 100,000 chimpanzees.
p76
aVComplete madness.
p77
aa(lp78
VIn contrast, humans normally gather there in tens of thousands,
p79
aVand what we get is not chaos, usually.
p80
aVWhat we get is extremely sophisticated and effective networks of cooperation.
p81
aVAll the huge achievements of humankind throughout history,
p82
aVwhether it's building the pyramids or flying to the moon,
p83
aVhave been based not on individual abilities,
p84
aVbut on this ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers.
p85
aa(lp86
VThink even about this very talk that I'm giving now:
p87
aVI'm standing here in front of an audience of about 300 or 400 people,
p88
aVmost of you are complete strangers to me.
p89
aVSimilarly, I don't really know all the people who have organized
p90
aVand worked on this event.
p91
aVI don't know the pilot and the crew members of the plane
p92
aVthat brought me over here, yesterday, to London.
p93
aVI don't know the people who invented and manufactured
p94
aVthis microphone and these cameras, which are recording what I'm saying.
p95
aVI don't know the people who wrote all the books and articles
p96
aVthat I read in preparation for this talk.
p97
aVAnd I certainly don't know all the people
p98
aVwho might be watching this talk over the Internet,
p99
aVsomewhere in Buenos Aires or in New Delhi.
p100
aa(lp101
VNevertheless, even though we don't know each other,
p102
aVwe can work together to create this global exchange of ideas.
p103
aVThis is something chimpanzees cannot do.
p104
aVThey communicate, of course,
p105
aVbut you will never catch a chimpanzee traveling to some distant chimpanzee band
p106
aVto give them a talk about bananas or about elephants,
p107
aVor anything else that might interest chimpanzees.
p108
aVNow cooperation is, of course, not always nice;
p109
aVall the horrible things humans have been doing throughout history \u2014
p110
aVand we have been doing some very horrible things \u2014
p111
aVall those things are also based on large-scale cooperation.
p112
aVPrisons are a system of cooperation;
p113
aVslaughterhouses are a system of cooperation;
p114
aVconcentration camps are a system of cooperation.
p115
aVChimpanzees don't have slaughterhouses and prisons and concentration camps.
p116
aa(lp117
VNow suppose I've managed to convince you perhaps that yes,
p118
aVwe control the world because we can cooperate flexibly in large numbers.
p119
aVThe next question that immediately arises
p120
aVin the mind of an inquisitive listener is:
p121
aVHow, exactly, do we do it?
p122
aVWhat enables us alone, of all the animals, to cooperate in such a way?
p123
aVThe answer is our imagination.
p124
aVWe can cooperate flexibly with countless numbers of strangers,
p125
aVbecause we alone, of all the animals on the planet,
p126
aVcan create and believe fictions, fictional stories.
p127
aVAnd as long as everybody believes in the same fiction,
p128
aVeverybody obeys and follows the same rules,
p129
aVthe same norms, the same values.
p130
aa(lp131
VAll other animals use their communication system
p132
aVonly to describe reality.
p133
aVA chimpanzee may say, "Look! There's a lion, let's run away!"
p134
aVOr, "Look! There's a banana tree over there! Let's go and get bananas!"
p135
aVHumans, in contrast, use their language not merely to describe reality,
p136
aVbut also to create new realities, fictional realities.
p137
aVA human can say, "Look, there is a god above the clouds!
p138
aVAnd if you don't do what I tell you to do,
p139
aVwhen you die, God will punish you and send you to hell."
p140
aVAnd if you all believe this story that I've invented,
p141
aVthen you will follow the same norms and laws and values,
p142
aVand you can cooperate.
p143
aVThis is something only humans can do.
p144
aVYou can never convince a chimpanzee to give you a banana
p145
aVby promising him, "... after you die, you'll go to chimpanzee heaven ..."
p146
aV(Laughter)
p147
aV"... and you'll receive lots and lots of bananas for your good deeds.
p148
aVSo now give me this banana."
p149
aVNo chimpanzee will ever believe such a story.
p150
aVOnly humans believe such stories,
p151
aVwhich is why we control the world,
p152
aVwhereas the chimpanzees are locked up in zoos and research laboratories.
p153
aa(lp154
VNow you may find it acceptable that yes,
p155
aVin the religious field, humans cooperate by believing in the same fictions.
p156
aVMillions of people come together to build a cathedral or a mosque
p157
aVor fight in a crusade or a jihad, because they all believe in the same stories
p158
aVabout God and heaven and hell.
p159
aVBut what I want to emphasize is that exactly the same mechanism
p160
aVunderlies all other forms of mass-scale human cooperation,
p161
aVnot only in the religious field.
p162
aa(lp163
VTake, for example, the legal field.
p164
aVMost legal systems today in the world are based on a belief in human rights.
p165
aVBut what are human rights?
p166
aVHuman rights, just like God and heaven, are just a story that we've invented.
p167
aVThey are not an objective reality;
p168
aVthey are not some biological effect about homo sapiens.
p169
aVTake a human being, cut him open, look inside,
p170
aVyou will find the heart, the kidneys, neurons, hormones, DNA,
p171
aVbut you won't find any rights.
p172
aVThe only place you find rights are in the stories
p173
aVthat we have invented and spread around over the last few centuries.
p174
aVThey may be very positive stories, very good stories,
p175
aVbut they're still just fictional stories that we've invented.
p176
aa(lp177
VThe same is true of the political field.
p178
aVThe most important factors in modern politics are states and nations.
p179
aVBut what are states and nations?
p180
aVThey are not an objective reality.
p181
aVA mountain is an objective reality.
p182
aVYou can see it, you can touch it, you can even smell it.
p183
aVBut a nation or a state,
p184
aVlike Israel or Iran or France or Germany,
p185
aVthis is just a story that we've invented
p186
aVand became extremely attached to.
p187
aa(lp188
VThe same is true of the economic field.
p189
aVThe most important actors today in the global economy
p190
aVare companies and corporations.
p191
aVMany of you today, perhaps, work for a corporation,
p192
aVlike Google or Toyota or McDonald's.
p193
aVWhat exactly are these things?
p194
aVThey are what lawyers call legal fictions.
p195
aVThey are stories invented and maintained
p196
aVby the powerful wizards we call lawyers.
p197
aV(Laughter)
p198
aVAnd what do corporations do all day?
p199
aVMostly, they try to make money.
p200
aVYet, what is money?
p201
aVAgain, money is not an objective reality; it has no objective value.
p202
aVTake this green piece of paper, the dollar bill.
p203
aVLook at it \u2014 it has no value.
p204
aVYou cannot eat it, you cannot drink it,
p205
aVyou cannot wear it.
p206
aVBut then came along these master storytellers \u2014
p207
aVthe big bankers,
p208
aVthe finance ministers,
p209
aVthe prime ministers \u2014
p210
aVand they tell us a very convincing story:
p211
aV"Look, you see this green piece of paper?
p212
aVIt is actually worth 10 bananas."
p213
aVAnd if I believe it, and you believe it,
p214
aVand everybody believes it,
p215
aVit actually works.
p216
aVI can take this worthless piece of paper,
p217
aVgo to the supermarket,
p218
aVgive it to a complete stranger whom I've never met before,
p219
aVand get, in exchange, real bananas which I can actually eat.
p220
aVThis is something amazing.
p221
aVYou could never do it with chimpanzees.
p222
aVChimpanzees trade, of course:
p223
aV"Yes, you give me a coconut, I'll give you a banana."
p224
aVThat can work.
p225
aVBut, you give me a worthless piece of paper
p226
aVand you except me to give you a banana?
p227
aVNo way!
p228
aVWhat do you think I am, a human?
p229
aV(Laughter)
p230
aa(lp231
VMoney, in fact, is the most successful story
p232
aVever invented and told by humans,
p233
aVbecause it is the only story everybody believes.
p234
aVNot everybody believes in God,
p235
aVnot everybody believes in human rights,
p236
aVnot everybody believes in nationalism,
p237
aVbut everybody believes in money, and in the dollar bill.
p238
aVTake, even, Osama Bin Laden.
p239
aVHe hated American politics and American religion
p240
aVand American culture,
p241
aVbut he had no objection to American dollars.
p242
aVHe was quite fond of them, actually.
p243
aV(Laughter)
p244
aa(lp245
VTo conclude, then:
p246
aVWe humans control the world because we live in a dual reality.
p247
aVAll other animals live in an objective reality.
p248
aVTheir reality consists of objective entities,
p249
aVlike rivers and trees and lions and elephants.
p250
aVWe humans, we also live in an objective reality.
p251
aVIn our world, too, there are rivers and trees and lions and elephants.
p252
aVBut over the centuries,
p253
aVwe have constructed on top of this objective reality
p254
aVa second layer of fictional reality,
p255
aVa reality made of fictional entities,
p256
aVlike nations, like gods, like money, like corporations.
p257
aVAnd what is amazing is that as history unfolded,
p258
aVthis fictional reality became more and more powerful
p259
aVso that today, the most powerful forces in the world
p260
aVare these fictional entities.
p261
aVToday, the very survival of rivers and trees and lions and elephants
p262
aVdepends on the decisions and wishes of fictional entities,
p263
aVlike the United States, like Google, like the World Bank \u2014
p264
aVentities that exist only in our own imagination.
p265
aa(lp266
VThank you.
p267
aV(Applause)
p268
aa(lp269
VBruno Giussani: Yuval, you have a new book out.
p270
aVAfter Sapiens, you wrote another one,
p271
aVand it's out in Hebrew, but not yet translated into ...
p272
aa(lp273
VYuval Noah Harari: I'm working on the translation as we speak.
p274
aa(lp275
VBG: In the book, if I understand it correctly,
p276
aVyou argue that the amazing breakthroughs that we are experiencing right now
p277
aVnot only will potentially make our lives better,
p278
aVbut they will create \u2014 and I quote you \u2014
p279
aV"... new classes and new class struggles, just as the industrial revolution did."
p280
aVCan you elaborate for us?
p281
aa(lp282
VYNH: Yes. In the industrial revolution,
p283
aVwe saw the creation of a new class of the urban proletariat.
p284
aVAnd much of the political and social history of the last 200 years involved
p285
aVwhat to do with this class, and the new problems and opportunities.
p286
aVNow, we see the creation of a new massive class of useless people.
p287
aV(Laughter)
p288
aVAs computers become better and better in more and more fields,
p289
aVthere is a distinct possibility that computers will out-perform us
p290
aVin most tasks and will make humans redundant.
p291
aVAnd then the big political and economic question
p292
aVof the 21st century will be,
p293
aV"What do we need humans for?",
p294
aVor at least, "What do we need so many humans for?"
p295
aa(lp296
VBG: Do you have an answer in the book?
p297
aa(lp298
VYNH: At present, the best guess we have is to keep them happy
p299
aVwith drugs and computer games ...
p300
aV(Laughter)
p301
aVbut this doesn't sound like a very appealing future.
p302
aa(lp303
VBG: Ok, so you're basically saying in the book and now,
p304
aVthat for all the discussion about the growing evidence
p305
aVof significant economic inequality, we are just kind of at the beginning
p306
aVof the process?
p307
aa(lp308
VYNH: Again, it's not a prophecy;
p309
aVit's seeing all kinds of possibilities before us.
p310
aVOne possibility is this creation of a new massive class of useless people.
p311
aVAnother possibility is the division of humankind
p312
aVinto different biological castes,
p313
aVwith the rich being upgraded into virtual gods,
p314
aVand the poor being degraded to this level of useless people.
p315
aa(lp316
VBG: I feel there is another TED talk coming up in a year or two.
p317
aVThank you, Yuval, for making the trip.
p318
aa(lp319
VYNH: Thanks!

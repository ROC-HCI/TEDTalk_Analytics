VWhen I was preparing for this talk,
p5
aVI went to search for a couple of quotes
p6
aVthat I can share with you.
p7
aVGood news: I found three
p8
aVthat I particularly liked,
p9
aVthe first by Samuel Johnson, who said,
p10
aV"When making your choice in life,
p11
aVdo not forget to live,"
p12
aVthe second by Aeschylus, who reminded us that
p13
aV"happiness is a choice that requires effort,"
p14
aVand the third is one by Groucho Marx
p15
aVwho said, "I wouldn't want to choose to belong
p16
aVto any club that would have me as a member."
p17
aa(lp18
VNow, bad news:
p19
aVI didn't know which one of these quotes
p20
aVto choose and share with you.
p21
aVThe sweet anxiety of choice.
p22
aa(lp23
VIn today's times of post-industrial capitalism,
p24
aVchoice, together with individual freedom
p25
aVand the idea of self-making,
p26
aVhas been elevated to an ideal.
p27
aVNow, together with this, we also have a belief
p28
aVin endless progress.
p29
aVBut the underside of this ideology
p30
aVhas been an increase of anxiety,
p31
aVfeelings of guilt,
p32
aVfeelings of being inadequate,
p33
aVfeeling that we are failing in our choices.
p34
aVSadly, this ideology of individual choice
p35
aVhas prevented us from thinking about social changes.
p36
aVIt appears that this ideology was actually
p37
aVvery efficient in pacifying us
p38
aVas political and social thinkers.
p39
aVInstead of making social critiques,
p40
aVwe are more and more engaging in self-critique,
p41
aVsometimes to the point of self-destruction.
p42
aa(lp43
VNow, how come that ideology of choice
p44
aVis still so powerful,
p45
aVeven among people who have
p46
aVnot many things to choose among?
p47
aVHow come that even people who are poor
p48
aVvery much still identify with the idea of choice,
p49
aVthe kind of rational idea of choice
p50
aVwhich we embrace?
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, the ideology of choice is very successful
p53
aVin opening for us a space to think
p54
aVabout some imagined future.
p55
aVLet me give you an example.
p56
aVMy friend Manya,
p57
aVwhen she was a student at university in California,
p58
aVwas earning money
p59
aVby working for a car dealer.
p60
aVNow, Manya, when she encountered
p61
aVthe typical customer, would debate with him
p62
aVabout his lifestyle,
p63
aVhow much he wants to spend,
p64
aVhow many children he has,
p65
aVwhat does he need the car for?
p66
aVThey would usually come to a good conclusion
p67
aVwhat would be a perfect car.
p68
aVNow, before Manya's customer would go home
p69
aVand think things through,
p70
aVshe would say to him,
p71
aV"The car that you are buying now is perfect,
p72
aVbut in a few year's time,
p73
aVwhen your kids will be already out of the house,
p74
aVwhen you will have a little bit more money,
p75
aVthat other car will be ideal.
p76
aVBut what you are buying now is great."
p77
aVNow, the majority of Manya's customers
p78
aVwho came back the next day
p79
aVbought that other car,
p80
aVthe car they did not need,
p81
aVthe car that cost far too much money.
p82
aVNow, Manya became so successful in selling cars
p83
aVthat soon she moved on to selling airplanes.
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aVAnd knowing so much about the psychology of people
p86
aVprepared her well for her current job,
p87
aVwhich is that of a psychoanalyst.
p88
aa(lp89
VNow, why were Manya's customers so irrational?
p90
aVManya's success was that she was able
p91
aVto open in their heads an image
p92
aVof an idealized future,
p93
aVan image of themselves
p94
aVwhen they are already more successful, freer,
p95
aVand for them, choosing that other car
p96
aVwas as if they are coming closer to this ideal
p97
aVin which it was as if Manya already saw them.
p98
aa(lp99
VNow, we rarely make really totally rational choices.
p100
aVChoices are influenced by our unconscious,
p101
aVby our community.
p102
aVWe're often choosing
p103
aVby guessing, what would other people
p104
aVthink about our choice?
p105
aVAlso we are choosing
p106
aVby looking at what others are choosing.
p107
aVWe're also guessing what is socially acceptable choice.
p108
aVNow, because of this, we actually
p109
aVeven after we have already chosen,
p110
aVlike bought a car,
p111
aVendlessly read reviews about cars,
p112
aVas if we still want to convince ourselves
p113
aVthat we made the right choice.
p114
aa(lp115
VNow, choices are anxiety-provoking.
p116
aVThey are linked to risks, losses.
p117
aVThey are highly unpredictable.
p118
aVNow, because of this,
p119
aVpeople have now more and more problems
p120
aVthat they are not choosing anything.
p121
aVNot long ago, I was at a wedding reception,
p122
aVand I met a young, beautiful woman
p123
aVwho immediately started telling me about her anxiety over choice.
p124
aVShe said to me, "I needed one month
p125
aVto decide which dress to wear."
p126
aVThen she said, "For weeks I was researching
p127
aVwhich hotel to stay for this one night.
p128
aVAnd now, I need to choose a sperm donor."
p129
aV(Laughter)
p130
aVI looked at this woman in shock.
p131
aV"Sperm donor? What's the rush?"
p132
aVShe said, "I'm turning 40 at the end of this year,
p133
aVand I've been so bad in choosing men in my life."
p134
aa(lp135
VNow choice, because it's linked to risk,
p136
aVis anxiety-provoking,
p137
aVand it was already the famous
p138
aVDanish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard
p139
aVwho pointed out that anxiety
p140
aVis linked to the possibility of possibility.
p141
aVNow, we think today that we can prevent these risks.
p142
aVWe have endless market analysis,
p143
aVprojections of the future earnings.
p144
aVEven with market, which is about chance,
p145
aVrandomness, we think we can predict rationally
p146
aVwhere it's going.
p147
aa(lp148
VNow, chance is actually becoming very traumatic.
p149
aVLast year, my friend Bernard Harcourt
p150
aVat the University of Chicago organized an event,
p151
aVa conference on the idea of chance.
p152
aVHe and I were together on the panel,
p153
aVand just before delivering our papers \u2014
p154
aVwe didn't know each other's papers \u2014
p155
aVwe decided to take chance seriously.
p156
aVSo we informed our audience
p157
aVthat what they will just now hear
p158
aVwill be a random paper,
p159
aVa mixture of the two papers
p160
aVwhich we didn't know what each was writing.
p161
aVNow, we delivered the conference in such a way.
p162
aVBernard read his first paragraph,
p163
aVI read my first paragraph,
p164
aVBernard read his second paragraph,
p165
aVI read my second paragraph,
p166
aVin this way towards the end of our papers.
p167
aVNow, you will be surprised
p168
aVthat a majority of our audience
p169
aVdid not think that what they'd just listened to
p170
aVwas a completely random paper.
p171
aVThey couldn't believe that
p172
aVspeaking from the position of authority
p173
aVlike two professors we were,
p174
aVwe would take chance seriously.
p175
aVThey thought we prepared the papers together
p176
aVand were just joking that it's random.
p177
aa(lp178
VNow, we live in times with a lot of information,
p179
aVbig data,
p180
aVa lot of knowledge about the insides of our bodies.
p181
aVWe decoded our genome.
p182
aVWe know about our brains more than before.
p183
aVBut surprisingly, people are more and more
p184
aVturning a blind eye in front of this knowledge.
p185
aVIgnorance and denial are on the rise.
p186
aVNow, in regard to the current economic crisis,
p187
aVwe think that we will just wake up again
p188
aVand everything will be the same as before,
p189
aVand no political or social changes are needed.
p190
aVIn regard to ecological crisis,
p191
aVwe think nothing needs to be done just now,
p192
aVor others need to act before us.
p193
aVOr even when ecological crisis already happens,
p194
aVlike a catastrophe in Fukushima,
p195
aVoften we have people living in the same environment
p196
aVwith the same amount of information,
p197
aVand half of them will be anxious about radiation
p198
aVand half of them will ignore it.
p199
aa(lp200
VNow, psychoanalysts know very well
p201
aVthat people surprisingly don't have
p202
aVpassion for knowledge
p203
aVbut passion for ignorance.
p204
aVNow, what does that mean?
p205
aVLet's say when we are facing
p206
aVa life-threatening illness,
p207
aVa lot of people don't want to know that.
p208
aVThey'd rather prefer denying the illness,
p209
aVwhich is why it's not so wise to inform them
p210
aVif they don't ask.
p211
aVSurprisingly, research shows that sometimes
p212
aVpeople who deny their illness
p213
aVlive longer than those who are rationally choosing
p214
aVthe best treatment.
p215
aa(lp216
VNow, this ignorance, however,
p217
aVis not very helpful on the level of the social.
p218
aVWhen we are ignorant about where we are heading,
p219
aVa lot of social damage can be caused.
p220
aa(lp221
VNow, on top of facing ignorance,
p222
aVwe are also facing today
p223
aVsome kind of an obviousness.
p224
aVNow, it was French philosopher
p225
aVLouis Althusser who pointed out
p226
aVthat ideology functions in such a way
p227
aVthat it creates a veil of obviousness.
p228
aVBefore we do any social critique,
p229
aVit is necessary really to lift that veil of obviousness
p230
aVand to think through a little bit differently.
p231
aVIf we go back to this ideology
p232
aVof individual, rational choice
p233
aVwe often embrace,
p234
aVit's necessary precisely here
p235
aVto lift this obviousness
p236
aVand to think a little bit differently.
p237
aa(lp238
VNow for me, a question often is
p239
aVwhy we still embrace this idea of a self-made man
p240
aVon which capitalism relied from its beginning?
p241
aVWhy do we think that we are really such masters
p242
aVof our lives that we can rationally
p243
aVmake the best ideal choices,
p244
aVthat we don't accept losses and risks?
p245
aVAnd for me, it's very shocking to see sometimes very poor people,
p246
aVfor example, not supporting the idea
p247
aVof the rich being taxed more.
p248
aVQuite often here they still identify
p249
aVwith a certain kind of a lottery mentality.
p250
aVOkay, maybe they don't think that they will make it
p251
aVin the future, but maybe they think,
p252
aVmy son might become the next Bill Gates.
p253
aVAnd who would want to tax one's son?
p254
aVOr, a question for me is also,
p255
aVwhy would people who have no health insurance
p256
aVnot embrace universal healthcare?
p257
aVSometimes they don't embrace it,
p258
aVagain identifying with the idea of choice,
p259
aVbut they have nothing to choose from.
p260
aa(lp261
VNow, Margaret Thatcher famously said
p262
aVthat there is nothing like a society.
p263
aVSociety doesn't exist, it is only individuals
p264
aVand their families.
p265
aVSadly, this ideology still functions very well,
p266
aVwhich is why people who are poor might feel
p267
aVashamed for their poverty.
p268
aVWe might endlessly feel guilty that we are
p269
aVnot making the right choices,
p270
aVand that's why we didn't succeed.
p271
aVWe are anxious that we are not good enough.
p272
aVThat's why we work very hard,
p273
aVlong hours at the workplace
p274
aVand equally long hours on remaking ourselves.
p275
aVNow, when we are anxious over choices,
p276
aVsometimes we easily give our power of choice away.
p277
aVWe identify with the guru
p278
aVwho tells us what to do,
p279
aVself-help therapist,
p280
aVor we embrace a totalitarian leader
p281
aVwho appears to have no doubts about choices,
p282
aVwho sort of knows.
p283
aa(lp284
VNow, often people ask me,
p285
aV"What did you learn by studying choice?"
p286
aVAnd there is an important message that I did learn.
p287
aVWhen thinking about choices,
p288
aVI stopped taking choices too seriously, personally.
p289
aVFirst, I realized a lot of choice I make
p290
aVis not rational.
p291
aVIt's linked to my unconscious,
p292
aVmy guesses of what others are choosing,
p293
aVor what is a socially embraced choice.
p294
aVI also embrace the idea
p295
aVthat we should go beyond
p296
aVthinking about individual choices,
p297
aVthat it's very important to rethink social choices,
p298
aVsince this ideology of individual choice has pacified us.
p299
aVIt really prevented us to think about social change.
p300
aVWe spend so much time choosing things for ourselves
p301
aVand barely reflect on
p302
aVcommunal choices we can make.
p303
aa(lp304
VNow, we should not forget that choice
p305
aVis always linked to change.
p306
aVWe can make individual changes,
p307
aVbut we can make social changes.
p308
aVWe can choose to have more wolves.
p309
aVWe can choose to change our environment
p310
aVto have more bees.
p311
aVWe can choose to have different rating agencies.
p312
aVWe can choose to control corporations
p313
aVinstead of allowing corporations to control us.
p314
aVWe have a possibility to make changes.
p315
aa(lp316
VNow, I started with a quote from Samuel Johnson,
p317
aVwho said that when we make choice in life,
p318
aVwe shouldn't forget to live.
p319
aVFinally, you can see
p320
aVI did have a choice
p321
aVto choose one of the three quotes
p322
aVwith which I wanted to start my lecture.
p323
aVI did have a choice,
p324
aVsuch as nations, as people,
p325
aVwe have choices too to rethink
p326
aVin what kind of society we want to live in the future.
p327
aa(lp328
VThank you.

VThis is a photograph
p5
aVof a man whom for many years
p6
aVI plotted to kill.
p7
aa(lp8
VThis is my father,
p9
aVClinton George "Bageye" Grant.
p10
aVHe's called Bageye because he has
p11
aVpermanent bags under his eyes.
p12
aVAs a 10-year-old, along with my siblings,
p13
aVI dreamt of scraping off the poison
p14
aVfrom fly-killer paper into his coffee,
p15
aVgrounded down glass and sprinkling it
p16
aVover his breakfast,
p17
aVloosening the carpet on the stairs
p18
aVso he would trip and break his neck.
p19
aVBut come the day, he would always
p20
aVskip that loose step,
p21
aVhe would always bow out of the house
p22
aVwithout so much as a swig of coffee
p23
aVor a bite to eat.
p24
aVAnd so for many years,
p25
aVI feared that my father would die
p26
aVbefore I had a chance to kill him.
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VUp until our mother asked him to leave
p30
aVand not come back,
p31
aVBageye had been a terrifying ogre.
p32
aVHe teetered permanently on the verge of rage,
p33
aVrather like me, as you see.
p34
aVHe worked nights at Vauxhall Motors in Luton
p35
aVand demanded total silence throughout the house,
p36
aVso that when we came home from school
p37
aVat 3:30 in the afternoon, we would huddle
p38
aVbeside the TV, and rather like safe-crackers,
p39
aVwe would twiddle with the volume control knob
p40
aVon the TV so it was almost inaudible.
p41
aVAnd at times, when we were like this,
p42
aVso much "Shhh," so much "Shhh"
p43
aVgoing on in the house
p44
aVthat I imagined us to be like
p45
aVthe German crew of a U-boat
p46
aVcreeping along the edge of the ocean
p47
aVwhilst up above, on the surface,
p48
aVHMS Bageye patrolled
p49
aVready to drop death charges
p50
aVat the first sound of any disturbance.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo that lesson was the lesson that
p53
aV"Do not draw attention to yourself
p54
aVeither in the home or outside of the home."
p55
aVMaybe it's a migrant lesson.
p56
aVWe were to be below the radar,
p57
aVso there was no communication, really,
p58
aVbetween Bageye and us and us and Bageye,
p59
aVand the sound that we most looked forward to,
p60
aVyou know when you're a child and you want
p61
aVyour father to come home and it's all going to be happy
p62
aVand you're waiting for that sound of the door opening.
p63
aVWell the sound that we looked forward to
p64
aVwas the click of the door closing,
p65
aVwhich meant he'd gone and would not come back.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo for three decades,
p68
aVI never laid eyes on my father, nor he on me.
p69
aVWe never spoke to each other for three decades,
p70
aVand then a couple of years ago, I decided
p71
aVto turn the spotlight on him.
p72
aa(lp73
V"You are being watched.
p74
aVActually, you are.
p75
aVYou are being watched."
p76
aVThat was his mantra to us, his children.
p77
aVTime and time again he would say this to us.
p78
aVAnd this was the 1970s, it was Luton,
p79
aVwhere he worked at Vauxhall Motors,
p80
aVand he was a Jamaican.
p81
aVAnd what he meant was,
p82
aVyou as a child of a Jamaican immigrant
p83
aVare being watched
p84
aVto see which way you turn, to see whether
p85
aVyou conform to the host nation's stereotype of you,
p86
aVof being feckless, work-shy,
p87
aVdestined for a life of crime.
p88
aVYou are being watched,
p89
aVso confound their expectations of you.
p90
aVTo that end, Bageye and his friends,
p91
aVmostly Jamaican,
p92
aVexhibited a kind of Jamaican bella figura:
p93
aVTurn your best side to the world,
p94
aVshow your best face to the world.
p95
aa(lp96
VIf you have seen some of the images
p97
aVof the Caribbean people arriving
p98
aVin the '40s and '50s,
p99
aVyou might have noticed that a lot of the men
p100
aVwear trilbies.
p101
aVNow, there was no tradition of wearing trilbies in Jamaica.
p102
aVThey invented that tradition for their arrival here.
p103
aVThey wanted to project themselves in a way
p104
aVthat they wanted to be perceived,
p105
aVso that the way they looked
p106
aVand the names that they gave themselves
p107
aVdefined them.
p108
aVSo Bageye is bald and has baggy eyes.
p109
aVTidy Boots is very fussy about his footwear.
p110
aVAnxious is always anxious.
p111
aVClock has one arm longer than the other.
p112
aV(Laughter)
p113
aVAnd my all-time favorite was the guy they called Summerwear.
p114
aVWhen Summerwear came to this country
p115
aVfrom Jamaica in the early '60s, he insisted
p116
aVon wearing light summer suits,
p117
aVno matter the weather,
p118
aVand in the course of researching their lives,
p119
aVI asked my mom, "Whatever became of Summerwear?"
p120
aVAnd she said, "He caught a cold and died." (Laughter)
p121
aVBut men like Summerwear
p122
aVtaught us the importance of style.
p123
aVMaybe they exaggerated their style
p124
aVbecause they thought that they were not considered
p125
aVto be quite civilized,
p126
aVand they transferred that generational attitude
p127
aVor anxiety onto us, the next generation,
p128
aVso much so that when I was growing up,
p129
aVif ever on the television news or radio
p130
aVa report came up about a black person
p131
aVcommitting some crime \u2014
p132
aVa mugging, a murder, a burglary \u2014
p133
aVwe winced along with our parents,
p134
aVbecause they were letting the side down.
p135
aVYou did not just represent yourself.
p136
aVYou represented the group,
p137
aVand it was a terrifying thing to come to terms with,
p138
aVin a way, that maybe you were going
p139
aVto be perceived in the same light.
p140
aVSo that was what needed to be challenged.
p141
aVOur father and many of his colleagues
p142
aVexhibited a kind of transmission but not receiving.
p143
aVThey were built to transmit but not receive.
p144
aVWe were to keep quiet.
p145
aVWhen our father did speak to us,
p146
aVit was from the pulpit of his mind.
p147
aVThey clung to certainty in the belief
p148
aVthat doubt would undermine them.
p149
aVBut when I am working in my house
p150
aVand writing, after a day's writing, I rush downstairs
p151
aVand I'm very excited to talk about Marcus Garvey or Bob Marley
p152
aVand words are tripping out of my mouth like butterflies
p153
aVand I'm so excited that my children stop me,
p154
aVand they say, "Dad, nobody cares."
p155
aV(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VBut they do care, actually.
p158
aVThey cross over.
p159
aVSomehow they find their way to you.
p160
aVThey shape their lives according to the narrative of your life,
p161
aVas I did with my father and my mother, perhaps,
p162
aVand maybe Bageye did with his father.
p163
aVAnd that was clearer to me
p164
aVin the course of looking at his life
p165
aVand understanding, as they say,
p166
aVthe Native Americans say,
p167
aV"Do not criticize the man until you can walk
p168
aVin his moccasins."
p169
aa(lp170
VBut in conjuring his life, it was okay
p171
aVand very straightforward to portray
p172
aVa Caribbean life in England in the 1970s
p173
aVwith bowls of plastic fruit,
p174
aVpolystyrene ceiling tiles,
p175
aVsettees permanently sheathed
p176
aVin their transparent covers that they were delivered in.
p177
aVBut what's more difficult to navigate
p178
aVis the emotional landscape
p179
aVbetween the generations,
p180
aVand the old adage that with age comes wisdom
p181
aVis not true.
p182
aVWith age comes the veneer of respectability
p183
aVand a veneer of uncomfortable truths.
p184
aa(lp185
VBut what was true was that my parents,
p186
aVmy mother, and my father went along with it,
p187
aVdid not trust the state to educate me.
p188
aVSo listen to how I sound.
p189
aVThey determined that they would send me to a private school,
p190
aVbut my father worked at Vauxhall Motors.
p191
aVIt's quite difficult to fund a private school education
p192
aVand feed his army of children.
p193
aVI remember going on to the school
p194
aVfor the entrance exam, and my father said
p195
aVto the priest \u2014 it was a Catholic school \u2014
p196
aVhe wanted a better "heducation" for the boy,
p197
aVbut also, he, my father,
p198
aVnever even managed to pass worms,
p199
aVnever mind entrance exams.
p200
aVBut in order to fund my education,
p201
aVhe was going to have to do some dodgy stuff,
p202
aVso my father would fund my education
p203
aVby trading in illicit goods from the back of his car,
p204
aVand that was made even more tricky because
p205
aVmy father, that's not his car by the way.
p206
aVMy father aspired to have a car like that,
p207
aVbut my father had a beaten-up Mini,
p208
aVand he never, being a Jamaican coming to this country,
p209
aVhe never had a driving license,
p210
aVhe never had any insurance or road tax or MOT.
p211
aVHe thought, "I know how to drive;
p212
aVwhy do I need the state's validation?"
p213
aVBut it became a little tricky when we were stopped by the police,
p214
aVand we were stopped a lot by the police,
p215
aVand I was impressed by the way
p216
aVthat my father dealt with the police.
p217
aVHe would promote the policeman immediately,
p218
aVso that P.C. Bloggs became Detective Inspector Bloggs
p219
aVin the course of the conversation
p220
aVand wave us on merrily.
p221
aVSo my father was exhibiting what we in Jamaica
p222
aVcalled "playing fool to catch wise."
p223
aVBut it lent also an idea
p224
aVthat actually he was being diminished
p225
aVor belittled by the policeman \u2014
p226
aVas a 10-year-old boy, I saw that \u2014
p227
aVbut also there was an ambivalence towards authority.
p228
aVSo on the one hand, there was
p229
aVa mocking of authority,
p230
aVbut on the other hand, there was a deference
p231
aVtowards authority,
p232
aVand these Caribbean people
p233
aVhad an overbearing obedience towards authority,
p234
aVwhich is very striking, very strange in a way,
p235
aVbecause migrants are very courageous people.
p236
aVThey leave their homes. My father and my mother
p237
aVleft Jamaica and they traveled 4,000 miles,
p238
aVand yet they were infantilized by travel.
p239
aVThey were timid,
p240
aVand somewhere along the line,
p241
aVthe natural order was reversed.
p242
aVThe children became the parents to the parent.
p243
aa(lp244
VThe Caribbean people came to this country with a five-year plan:
p245
aVthey would work, some money, and then go back,
p246
aVbut the five years became 10, the 10 became 15,
p247
aVand before you know it, you're changing the wallpaper,
p248
aVand at that point, you know you're here to stay.
p249
aVAlthough there's still the kind of temporariness
p250
aVthat our parents felt about being here,
p251
aVbut we children knew that the game was up.
p252
aVI think there was a feeling that
p253
aVthey would not be able to continue with the ideals
p254
aVof the life that they expected.
p255
aVThe reality was very much different.
p256
aVAnd also, that was true of the reality
p257
aVof trying to educate me.
p258
aVHaving started the process, my father did not continue.
p259
aVIt was left to my mother to educate me,
p260
aVand as George Lamming would say,
p261
aVit was my mother who fathered me.
p262
aa(lp263
VEven in his absence, that old mantra remained:
p264
aVYou are being watched.
p265
aVBut such ardent watchfulness can lead to anxiety,
p266
aVso much so that years later, when I was investigating
p267
aVwhy so many young black men
p268
aVwere diagnosed with schizophrenia,
p269
aVsix times more than they ought to be,
p270
aVI was not surprised to hear the psychiatrist say,
p271
aV"Black people are schooled in paranoia."
p272
aVAnd I wonder what Bageye would make of that.
p273
aa(lp274
VNow I also had a 10-year-old son,
p275
aVand turned my attention to Bageye
p276
aVand I went in search of him.
p277
aVHe was back in Luton, he was now 82,
p278
aVand I hadn't seen him for 30-odd years,
p279
aVand when he opened the door,
p280
aVI saw this tiny little man with lambent, smiling eyes,
p281
aVand he was smiling, and I'd never seen him smile.
p282
aVI was very disconcerted by that.
p283
aVBut we sat down, and he had a Caribbean friend with him,
p284
aVtalking some old time talk,
p285
aVand my father would look at me,
p286
aVand he looked at me as if I would
p287
aVmiraculously disappear as I had arisen.
p288
aVAnd he turned to his friend, and he said,
p289
aV"This boy and me have a deep, deep connection,
p290
aVdeep, deep connection."
p291
aVBut I never felt that connection.
p292
aVIf there was a pulse, it was very weak
p293
aVor hardly at all.
p294
aVAnd I almost felt in the course of that reunion
p295
aVthat I was auditioning to be my father's son.
p296
aa(lp297
VWhen the book came out,
p298
aVit had fair reviews in the national papers,
p299
aVbut the paper of choice in Luton is not The Guardian,
p300
aVit's the Luton News,
p301
aVand the Luton News ran the headline about the book,
p302
aV"The Book That May Heal a 32-Year-Old Rift."
p303
aVAnd I understood that could also represent
p304
aVthe rift between one generation and the next,
p305
aVbetween people like me and my father's generation,
p306
aVbut there's no tradition in Caribbean life
p307
aVof memoirs or biographies.
p308
aVIt was a tradition that you didn't chat about your business in public.
p309
aVBut I welcomed that title, and I thought actually, yes,
p310
aVthere is a possibility that this
p311
aVwill open up conversations that we'd never had before.
p312
aVThis will close the generation gap, perhaps.
p313
aVThis could be an instrument of repair.
p314
aVAnd I even began to feel that this book
p315
aVmay be perceived by my father
p316
aVas an act of filial devotion.
p317
aa(lp318
VPoor, deluded fool.
p319
aVBageye was stung by what he perceived to be
p320
aVthe public airing of his shortcomings.
p321
aVHe was stung by my betrayal,
p322
aVand he went to the newspapers the next day
p323
aVand demanded a right of reply,
p324
aVand he got it with the headline
p325
aV"Bageye Bites Back."
p326
aVAnd it was a coruscating account of my betrayal.
p327
aVI was no son of his.
p328
aVHe recognized in his mind that his colors
p329
aVhad been dragged through the mud, and he couldn't allow that.
p330
aVHe had to restore his dignity, and he did so,
p331
aVand initially, although I was disappointed,
p332
aVI grew to admire that stance.
p333
aVThere was still fire bubbling through his veins,
p334
aVeven though he was 82 years old.
p335
aVAnd if it meant that we would now return
p336
aVto 30 years of silence,
p337
aVmy father would say, "If it's so, then it's so."
p338
aa(lp339
VJamaicans will tell you that there's no such thing as facts,
p340
aVthere are only versions.
p341
aVWe all tell ourselves the versions of the story
p342
aVthat we can best live with.
p343
aVEach generation builds up an edifice
p344
aVwhich they are reluctant or sometimes unable
p345
aVto disassemble,
p346
aVbut in the writing, my version of the story
p347
aVbegan to change,
p348
aVand it was detached from me.
p349
aVI lost my hatred of my father.
p350
aVI did no longer want him to die or to murder him,
p351
aVand I felt free,
p352
aVmuch freer than I'd ever felt before.
p353
aVAnd I wonder whether that freedness
p354
aVcould be transferred to him.
p355
aa(lp356
VIn that initial reunion,
p357
aVI was struck by an idea that I had
p358
aVvery few photographs of myself
p359
aVas a young child.
p360
aVThis is a photograph of me,
p361
aVnine months old.
p362
aVIn the original photograph,
p363
aVI'm being held up by my father, Bageye,
p364
aVbut when my parents separated, my mother
p365
aVexcised him from all aspects of our lives.
p366
aVShe took a pair of scissors and cut  him out of every photograph,
p367
aVand for years, I told myself the truth of this photograph
p368
aVwas that you are alone,
p369
aVyou are unsupported.
p370
aVBut there's another way of looking at this photograph.
p371
aVThis is a photograph that has the potential
p372
aVfor a reunion,
p373
aVa potential to be reunited with my father,
p374
aVand in my yearning to be held up by my father,
p375
aVI held him up to the light.
p376
aa(lp377
VIn that first reunion,
p378
aVit was very awkward and tense moments,
p379
aVand to lessen the tension,
p380
aVwe decided to go for a walk.
p381
aVAnd as we walked, I was struck
p382
aVthat I had reverted to being the child
p383
aVeven though I was now towering above my father.
p384
aVI was almost a foot taller than my father.
p385
aVHe was still the big man,
p386
aVand I tried to match his step.
p387
aVAnd I realized that he was walking
p388
aVas if he was still under observation,
p389
aVbut I admired his walk.
p390
aVHe walked like a man
p391
aVon the losing side of the F.A. Cup Final
p392
aVmounting the steps to collect his condolence medal.
p393
aVThere was dignity in defeat.
p394
aa(lp395
VThank you.
p396

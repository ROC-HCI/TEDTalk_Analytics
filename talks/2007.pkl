VWhat do augmented reality
p5
aVand professional football
p6
aVhave to do with empathy?
p7
aVAnd what is the air speed velocity
p8
aVof an unladen swallow?
p9
aVNow unfortunately, I'm only going to answer
p10
aVone of those questions today,
p11
aVso please, try and contain your disappointment.
p12
aa(lp13
VWhen most people think about augmented reality,
p14
aVthey think about "Minority Report" and Tom Cruise
p15
aVwaving his hands in the air,
p16
aVbut augmented reality is not science fiction.
p17
aVAugmented reality is something that will happen
p18
aVin our lifetime, and it will happen
p19
aVbecause we have the tools to make it happen,
p20
aVand people need to be aware of that,
p21
aVbecause augmented reality will change our lives
p22
aVjust as much as the Internet and the cell phone.
p23
aa(lp24
VNow how do we get to augmented reality?
p25
aVStep one is the step I'm wearing right now,
p26
aVGoogle Glass.
p27
aVI'm sure many of you are familiar with Google Glass.
p28
aVWhat you may not be familiar with
p29
aVis that Google Glass is a device
p30
aVthat will allow you to see what I see.
p31
aVIt will allow you to experience what it is like
p32
aVto be a professional athlete on the field.
p33
aVRight now, the only way you can be on the field
p34
aVis for me to try and describe it to you.
p35
aVI have to use words.
p36
aVI have to create a framework that you then fill in
p37
aVwith your imagination.
p38
aVWith Google Glass, we can put that
p39
aVunderneath a helmet,
p40
aVand we can get a sense of what it's like
p41
aVto be running down the field at 100 miles an hour,
p42
aVyour blood pounding in your ears.
p43
aVYou can get a sense of what it's like
p44
aVto have a 250-pound man
p45
aVsprinting at you
p46
aVtrying to decapitate you
p47
aVwith every ounce of his being.
p48
aVAnd I've been on the receiving end of that,
p49
aVand it doesn't feel very good.
p50
aa(lp51
VNow, I have some footage to show you of what it's like
p52
aVto wear Google Glass underneath the helmet
p53
aVto give you a taste of that.
p54
aVUnfortunately, it's not NFL practice footage
p55
aVbecause the NFL thinks emergent technology
p56
aVis what happens when a submarine surfaces,
p57
aVbut \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 we do what we can.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo let's pull up some video.
p60
aa(lp61
V(Video) Chris Kluwe: Go.
p62
aVUgh, getting tackled sucks.
p63
aVHold on, let's get a little closer.
p64
aVAll right, ready?
p65
aVGo!
p66
aa(lp67
VChris Kluwe: So as you can see,
p68
aVsmall taste of what it's like to get tackled
p69
aVon the football field
p70
aVfrom the perspective of the tacklee.
p71
aVNow, you may have noticed there are
p72
aVsome people missing there:
p73
aVthe rest of the team.
p74
aVWe have some video of that
p75
aVcourtesy of the University of Washington.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Video) Quarterback: Hey, Mice 54! Mice 54!
p78
aVBlue 8! Blue 8! Go!
p79
aVOh!
p80
aa(lp81
VCK: So again, this takes you a little bit closer
p82
aVto what it's like to be on that field,
p83
aVbut this is nowhere what it's like
p84
aVto be on the NFL.
p85
aa(lp86
VFans want that experience.
p87
aVFans want to be on that field.
p88
aVThey want to be their favorite players,
p89
aVand they've already talked to me on YouTube,
p90
aVthey've talked to me on Twitter, saying,
p91
aV"Hey, can you get this on a quarterback?
p92
aVCan you get this on a running back?
p93
aVWe want that experience."
p94
aa(lp95
VWell, once we have that experience with GoPro
p96
aVand Google Glass,
p97
aVhow do we make it more immersive?
p98
aVHow do we take that next step?
p99
aVWell, we take that step
p100
aVby going to something called the Oculus Rift,
p101
aVwhich I'm sure many of you are also familiar with.
p102
aVThe Oculus Rift has been described as one of
p103
aVthe most realistic virtual reality devices ever created,
p104
aVand that is not empty hype.
p105
aVI'm going to show you why that is not empty hype
p106
aVwith this video.
p107
aV(Video) Man: Oh! Oh!
p108
aVNo! No! No! I don't want to play anymore! No!
p109
aVOh my God! Aaaah!
p110
aa(lp111
VCK: So that is the experience of a man
p112
aVon a roller coaster
p113
aVin fear of his life.
p114
aVWhat do you think that fan's experience
p115
aVis going to be when we take the video footage
p116
aVof an Adrian Peterson bursting through the line,
p117
aVshedding a tackler with a stiff-arm
p118
aVbefore sprinting in for a touchdown?
p119
aVWhat do you think that fan's experience
p120
aVis going to be when he's Messi
p121
aVsprinting down the pitch
p122
aVputting the ball in the back of the net,
p123
aVor Federer serving in Wimbledon?
p124
aVWhat do you think his experience is going to be
p125
aVwhen he is going down the side of a mountain
p126
aVat over 70 miles an hour
p127
aVas an Olympic downhill skier?
p128
aVI think adult diaper sales may surge.
p129
aV(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VBut this is not yet augmented reality.
p132
aVThis is only virtual reality, V.R.
p133
aVHow do we get to augmented reality, A.R.?
p134
aVWe get to augmented reality
p135
aVwhen coaches and managers and owners
p136
aVlook at this information streaming in
p137
aVthat people want to see, and they say,
p138
aV"How do we use this to make our teams better?
p139
aVHow do we use this to win games?"
p140
aVBecause teams always use technology to win games.
p141
aVThey like winning. It makes them money.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo a brief history of technology in the NFL.
p144
aVIn 1965, the Baltimore Colts
p145
aVput a wristband on their quarterback
p146
aVto allow him to call plays quicker.
p147
aVThey ended up winning a Super Bowl that year.
p148
aVOther teams followed suit.
p149
aVMore people watched the game because it was more exciting.
p150
aVIt was faster.
p151
aa(lp152
VIn 1994, the NFL put helmet radios
p153
aVinto the helmets of the quarterbacks,
p154
aVand later the defense.
p155
aVMore people watched games because it was faster.
p156
aVIt was more entertaining.
p157
aa(lp158
VIn 2023, imagine you're a player
p159
aVwalking back to the huddle,
p160
aVand you have your next play displayed
p161
aVright in front of your face on your clear plastic visor
p162
aVthat you already wear right now.
p163
aVNo more having to worry about forgetting plays.
p164
aVNo more worrying about having to memorize your playbook.
p165
aVYou just go out and react.
p166
aVAnd coaches really want this,
p167
aVbecause missed assignments lose you games,
p168
aVand coaches hate losing games.
p169
aVLosing games gets you fired as a coach.
p170
aVThey don't want that.
p171
aa(lp172
VBut augmented reality is not just
p173
aVan enhanced playbook.
p174
aVAugmented reality is also a way to take all that data
p175
aVand use it in real time
p176
aVto enhance how you play the game.
p177
aVWhat would that be like?
p178
aVWell, a very simple setup would be a camera
p179
aVon each corner of the stadium looking down,
p180
aVgiving you a bird's-eye view
p181
aVof all the people down there.
p182
aVYou also have information from helmet sensors
p183
aVand accelerometers,
p184
aVtechnology that's being worked on right now.
p185
aVYou take all that information, and you stream it to your players.
p186
aVThe good teams stream it in a way that the players can use.
p187
aVThe bad ones have information overload.
p188
aVThat determines good teams from bad.
p189
aVAnd now, your I.T. department
p190
aVis just as important as your scouting department,
p191
aVand data-mining is not for nerds anymore.
p192
aVIt's also for jocks. Who knew?
p193
aa(lp194
VWhat would that look like on the field?
p195
aVWell, imagine you're the quarterback.
p196
aVYou take the snap and you drop back.
p197
aVYou're scanning downfield for an open receiver.
p198
aVAll of a sudden, a bright flash
p199
aVon the left side of your visor lets you know,
p200
aVblind side linebacker is blitzing in.
p201
aVNormally, you wouldn't be able to see him,
p202
aVbut the augmented reality system lets you know.
p203
aVYou step up into the pocket.
p204
aVAnother flash alerts you to an open receiver.
p205
aVYou throw the ball, but you're hit right as you throw.
p206
aVThe ball comes off track.
p207
aVYou don't know where it's going to land.
p208
aVHowever, on the receiver's visor,
p209
aVhe sees a patch of grass light up,
p210
aVand he knows to readjust.
p211
aVHe goes, catches the ball,
p212
aVsprints in, touchdown.
p213
aVCrowd goes wild, and the fans are with him
p214
aVevery step of the way,
p215
aVwatching from every perspective.
p216
aa(lp217
VNow this is something that will create
p218
aVmassive excitement in the game.
p219
aVIt will make tons of people watch,
p220
aVbecause people want this experience.
p221
aVFans want to be on the field.
p222
aVThey want to be their favorite player.
p223
aVAugmented reality will be a part of sports,
p224
aVbecause it's too profitable not to.
p225
aa(lp226
VBut the question I ask you is,
p227
aVis that's all that we're content to use augmented reality for?
p228
aVAre we going to use it solely for our panem,
p229
aVour circenses, our entertainment as normal?
p230
aVBecause I believe that we can use augmented reality
p231
aVfor something more.
p232
aVI believe we can use augmented reality
p233
aVas a way to foster more empathy
p234
aVwithin the human species itself,
p235
aVby literally showing someone
p236
aVwhat it looks like
p237
aVto walk a mile in another person's shoes.
p238
aVWe know what this technology is worth
p239
aVto sports leagues.
p240
aVIt's worth revenue, to the tune of billions of dollars a year.
p241
aVBut what is this technology worth
p242
aVto a teacher in a classroom
p243
aVtrying to show a bully
p244
aVjust how harmful his actions are
p245
aVfrom the perspective of the victim?
p246
aVWhat is this technology worth
p247
aVto a gay Ugandan or Russian
p248
aVtrying to show the world what it's like
p249
aVliving under persecution?
p250
aVWhat is this technology worth
p251
aVto a Commander Hadfield or a Neil deGrasse Tyson
p252
aVtrying to inspire a generation of children
p253
aVto think more about space and science
p254
aVinstead of quarterly reports and Kardashians?
p255
aa(lp256
VLadies and gentlemen, augmented reality
p257
aVis coming.
p258
aVThe questions we ask, the choices we make,
p259
aVand the challenges we face
p260
aVare, as always, up to us.
p261
aa(lp262
VThank you.

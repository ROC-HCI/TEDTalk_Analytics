VWhen I was little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
p5
aVAnd I grew up singing a song called "Nothing To Envy."
p6
aVAnd I was very proud.
p7
aVIn school, we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim Il-Sung,
p8
aVbut we never learned much about the outside world,
p9
aVexcept that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
p10
aVAlthough I often wondered about the outside world,
p11
aVI thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea,
p12
aVuntil everything suddenly changed.
p13
aa(lp14
VWhen I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution.
p15
aVBut I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
p16
aVMy family was not poor,
p17
aVand myself, I had never experienced hunger.
p18
aa(lp19
VBut one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter
p20
aVfrom a coworker's sister.
p21
aVIt read, "When you read this,
p22
aVour five family members will not exist in this world,
p23
aVbecause we haven't eaten for the past three weeks.
p24
aVWe are lying on the floor together,
p25
aVand our bodies are so weak, we are waiting to die."
p26
aa(lp27
VI was so shocked.
p28
aVThis was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering.
p29
aVSoon after, when I was walking past a train station,
p30
aVI saw something terrible that to this day I can't erase from my memory.
p31
aVA lifeless woman was lying on the ground,
p32
aVwhile an emaciated child in her arms
p33
aVjust stared helplessly at his mother's face.
p34
aVBut nobody helped them,
p35
aVbecause they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families.
p36
aa(lp37
VA huge famine hit North Korea in the mid-1990s.
p38
aVUltimately, more than a million North Koreans died during the famine,
p39
aVand many only survived by eating grass, bugs and tree bark.
p40
aVPower outages also became more and more frequent,
p41
aVso everything around me was completely dark at night,
p42
aVexcept for the sea of lights in China,
p43
aVjust across the river from my home.
p44
aVI always wondered why they had lights, but we didn't.
p45
aVThis is a satellite picture showing North Korea at night,
p46
aVcompared to neighbors.
p47
aa(lp48
VThis is the Amnok River,
p49
aVwhich serves as a part of the border between North Korea and China.
p50
aVAs you can see, the river can be very narrow at certain points,
p51
aVallowing North Koreans to secretly cross.
p52
aVBut many die.
p53
aVSometimes, I saw dead bodies floating down the river.
p54
aVI can't reveal many details about how I left North Korea,
p55
aVbut I only can say that during the ugly years of the famine,
p56
aVI was sent to China to live with distant relatives.
p57
aVBut I only thought that I would be separated from my family
p58
aVfor a short time.
p59
aVI could have never imagined
p60
aVthat it would take 14 years to live together.
p61
aa(lp62
VIn China, it was hard living as a young girl without my family.
p63
aVI had no idea what life was going to be like
p64
aVas a North Korean refugee.
p65
aVBut I soon learned it's not only extremely difficult,
p66
aVit's also very dangerous,
p67
aVsince North Korean refugees are considered in China as illegal migrants.
p68
aVSo I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed,
p69
aVand I would be repatriated to a horrible fate,
p70
aVback in North Korea.
p71
aa(lp72
VOne day, my worst nightmare came true,
p73
aVwhen I was caught by the Chinese police,
p74
aVand brought to the police station for interrogation.
p75
aVSomeone had accused me of being North Korean,
p76
aVso they tested my Chinese language abilities,
p77
aVand asked me tons of questions.
p78
aVI was so scared.
p79
aVI thought my heart was going to explode.
p80
aVIf anything seemed unnatural, I could be imprisoned and repatriated.
p81
aVI thought my life was over.
p82
aVBut I managed to control all the emotions inside me,
p83
aVand answer the questions.
p84
aVAfter they finished questioning me,
p85
aVone official said to another,
p86
aV"This was a false report. She's not North Korean."
p87
aVAnd they let me go. It was a miracle.
p88
aa(lp89
VSome North Koreans in China seek asylum in foreign embassies.
p90
aVBut many can be caught by the Chinese police,
p91
aVand repatriated.
p92
aVThese girls were so lucky.
p93
aVEven though they were caught,
p94
aVthey were eventually released, after heavy international pressure.
p95
aVThese North Koreans were not so lucky.
p96
aVEvery year, countless North Koreans are caught in China
p97
aVand repatriated to North Korea,
p98
aVwhere they can be tortured, imprisoned, or publicly executed.
p99
aa(lp100
VEven though I was really fortunate to get out,
p101
aVmany other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
p102
aVIt's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities
p103
aVand struggle so hard just to survive.
p104
aVEven after learning a new language and getting a job,
p105
aVtheir whole world can be turned upside down in an instant.
p106
aVThat's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity,
p107
aVI decided to risk going to South Korea.
p108
aVAnd I started a new life yet again.
p109
aa(lp110
VSettling down in South Korea
p111
aVwas a lot more challenging than I had expected.
p112
aVEnglish was so important in South Korea,
p113
aVso I had to start learning my third language.
p114
aVAlso, I realized there was a wide gap between North and South.
p115
aVWe are all Korean, but inside,
p116
aVwe have become very different, due to 67 years of division.
p117
aVI even went through an identity crisis.
p118
aVAm I South Korean or North Korean?
p119
aVWhere am I from? Who am I?
p120
aVSuddenly, there was no country I could proudly call my own.
p121
aa(lp122
VEven though adjusting to life in South Korea was not easy,
p123
aVI made a plan \u2014 I started studying for the university entrance exam.
p124
aa(lp125
VJust as I was starting to get used to my new life,
p126
aVI received a shocking phone call.
p127
aVThe North Korean authorities intercepted some money
p128
aVthat I sent to my family,
p129
aVand, as a punishment, my family was going to be forcibly removed
p130
aVto a desolate location in the countryside.
p131
aVThey had to get out quickly.
p132
aVSo I started planning how to help them escape.
p133
aa(lp134
VNorth Koreans have to travel incredible distances
p135
aVon the path to freedom.
p136
aVIt's almost impossible to cross the border
p137
aVbetween North Korea and South Korea.
p138
aVSo, ironically, I took a flight back to China
p139
aVand headed toward the North Korean border.
p140
aVSince my family couldn't speak Chinese,
p141
aVI had to guide them somehow through more than 2,000 miles
p142
aVin China, and then into Southeast Asia.
p143
aVThe journey by bus took one week,
p144
aVand we were almost caught several times.
p145
aVOne time, our bus was stopped and boarded by a Chinese police officer.
p146
aVHe took everyone's I.D. cards,
p147
aVand he started asking them questions.
p148
aVSince my family couldn't understand Chinese,
p149
aVI thought my family was going to be arrested.
p150
aVAs the Chinese officer approached my family,
p151
aVI impulsively stood up, and I told him
p152
aVthat these are deaf and dumb people that I was chaperoning.
p153
aVHe looked at me suspiciously,
p154
aVbut luckily, he believed me.
p155
aa(lp156
VWe made it all the way to the border of Laos.
p157
aVBut I had to spend almost all my money
p158
aVto bribe the border guards in Laos.
p159
aVBut even after we got past the border,
p160
aVmy family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing.
p161
aVAfter I paid the fine and bribe,
p162
aVmy family was released in one month.
p163
aVBut soon after, my family was arrested and jailed again,
p164
aVin the capital of Laos.
p165
aa(lp166
VThis was one of the lowest points in my life.
p167
aVI did everything to get my family to freedom,
p168
aVand we came so close,
p169
aVbut my family was thrown in jail,
p170
aVjust a short distance from the South Korean embassy.
p171
aVI went back and forth between the immigration office
p172
aVand the police station,
p173
aVdesperately trying to get my family out.
p174
aVbut I didn't have enough money to pay a bribe or fine anymore.
p175
aVI lost all hope.
p176
aa(lp177
VAt that moment, I heard one man's voice ask me,
p178
aV"What's wrong?"
p179
aVI was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask.
p180
aVIn my broken English, and with a dictionary,
p181
aVI explained the situation, and without hesitating,
p182
aVthe man went to the ATM,
p183
aVand he paid the rest of the money for my family,
p184
aVand two other North Koreans to get out of jail.
p185
aa(lp186
VI thanked him with all my heart, and I asked him,
p187
aV"Why are you helping me?"
p188
aa(lp189
V"I'm not helping you," he said.
p190
aV"I'm helping the North Korean people."
p191
aa(lp192
VI realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
p193
aVThe kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and the North Korean people,
p194
aVwhen we needed it most.
p195
aVAnd he showed me that the kindness of strangers
p196
aVand the support of the international community
p197
aVare truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need.
p198
aa(lp199
VEventually, after our long journey,
p200
aVmy family and I were reunited in South Korea.
p201
aVBut getting to freedom is only half the battle.
p202
aVMany North Koreans are separated from their families,
p203
aVand when they arrive in a new country,
p204
aVthey start with little or no money.
p205
aVSo we can benefit from the international community
p206
aVfor education, English language training, job training, and more.
p207
aVWe can also act as a bridge
p208
aVbetween the people inside North Korea and the outside world.
p209
aVBecause many of us stay in contact with family members still inside,
p210
aVand we send information and money
p211
aVthat is helping to change North Korea from inside.
p212
aa(lp213
VI've been so lucky, received so much help and inspiration in my life,
p214
aVso I want to help give aspiring North Koreans
p215
aVa chance to prosper with international support.
p216
aVI'm confident that you will see more and more North Koreans
p217
aVsucceeding all over the world,
p218
aVincluding the TED stage.
p219
aa(lp220
VThank you.

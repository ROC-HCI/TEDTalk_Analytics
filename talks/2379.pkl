VChris Anderson: Perhaps we could start by just telling us about your country.
p5
aVIt's three dots there on the globe. Those dots are pretty huge.
p6
aVI think each one is about the size of California.
p7
aVTell us about Kiribati.
p8
aa(lp9
VAnote Tong: Well, let me first begin by saying how deeply grateful I am
p10
aVfor this opportunity to share my story with people who do care.
p11
aVI think I've been sharing my story with a lot of people who don't care too much.
p12
aVBut Kiribati is comprised of three groups of islands:
p13
aVthe Gilbert Group on the west,
p14
aVwe have the Phoenix Islands in the middle,
p15
aVand the Line Islands in the east.
p16
aVAnd quite frankly, Kiribati is perhaps the only country
p17
aVthat is actually in the four corners of the world,
p18
aVbecause we are in the Northern Hemisphere, in the Southern Hemisphere,
p19
aVand also in the east and the west of the International Date Line.
p20
aVThese islands are entirely made up of coral atolls,
p21
aVand on average about two meters above sea level.
p22
aVAnd so this is what we have.
p23
aVUsually not more than two kilometers in width.
p24
aVAnd so, on many occasions, I've been asked by people,
p25
aV"You know, you're suffering, why don't you move back?"
p26
aVThey don't understand.
p27
aVThey have no concept of what it is that's involved.
p28
aVWith the rising sea, they say, "Well, you can move back."
p29
aVAnd so this is what I tell them.
p30
aVIf we move back, we will fall off on the other side of the ocean. OK?
p31
aVBut these are the kinds of issues that people don't understand.
p32
aa(lp33
VCA: So certainly this is just a picture of fragility there.
p34
aVWhen was it that you yourself realized
p35
aVthat there might be impending peril for your country?
p36
aa(lp37
VAT: Well, the story of climate change has been one that has been going on
p38
aVfor quite a number of decades.
p39
aVAnd when I came into office in 2003,
p40
aVI began talking about climate change at the United Nations General Assembly,
p41
aVbut not with so much passion,
p42
aVbecause then there was still this controversy among the scientists
p43
aVwhether it was human-induced, whether it was real or it wasn't.
p44
aVBut I think that that debate was fairly much concluded in 2007
p45
aVwith the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC,
p46
aVwhich made a categorical statement that it is real, it's human-induced,
p47
aVand it's predicting some very serious scenarios
p48
aVfor countries like mine.
p49
aVAnd so that's when I got very serious.
p50
aVIn the past, I talked about it.
p51
aVWe were worried.
p52
aVBut when the scenarios, the predictions came in 2007,
p53
aVit became a real issue for us.
p54
aa(lp55
VCA: Now, those predictions are, I think, that by 2100,
p56
aVsea levels are forecast to rise perhaps three feet.
p57
aVThere's scenarios where it's higher than that, for sure,
p58
aVbut what would you say to a skeptic who said,
p59
aV"What's three feet?
p60
aVYou're on average six feet above sea level.
p61
aVWhat's the problem?"
p62
aa(lp63
VAT: Well, I think it's got to be understood
p64
aVthat a marginal rise in sea level
p65
aVwould mean a loss of a lot of land,
p66
aVbecause much of the land is low.
p67
aVAnd quite apart from that, we are getting the swells at the moment.
p68
aVSo it's not about getting two feet.
p69
aVI think what many people do not understand
p70
aVis they think climate change is something that is happening in the future.
p71
aVWell, we're at the very bottom end of the spectrum.
p72
aVIt's already with us.
p73
aVWe have communities who already have been dislocated.
p74
aVThey have had to move, and every parliament session,
p75
aVI'm getting complaints from different communities
p76
aVasking for assistance to build seawalls,
p77
aVto see what we can do about the freshwater lens
p78
aVbecause it's being destroyed,
p79
aVand so in my trips to the different islands,
p80
aVI'm seeing evidence of communities
p81
aVwhich are now having to cope with the loss of food crops,
p82
aVthe contamination of the water lenses,
p83
aVand I see these communities perhaps leaving, having to relocate,
p84
aVwithin five to 10 years.
p85
aa(lp86
VCA: And then, I think the country suffered its first cyclone,
p87
aVand this is connected, yes? What happened here?
p88
aa(lp89
VAT: Well, we're on the equator,
p90
aVand I'm sure many of you understand that when you're on the equator,
p91
aVit's supposed to be in the doldrums. We're not supposed to get the cyclones.
p92
aVWe create them, and then we send them either north or south.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VBut they aren't supposed to come back.
p97
aVBut for the first time, at the beginning of this year,
p98
aVthe Cyclone Pam, which destroyed Vanuatu,
p99
aVand in the process, the very edges of it actually touched
p100
aVour two southernmost islands,
p101
aVand all of Tuvalu was underwater when Hurricane Pam struck.
p102
aVBut for our two southernmost islands,
p103
aVwe had waves come over half the island,
p104
aVand so this has never happened before.
p105
aVIt's a new experience.
p106
aVAnd I've just come back from my own constituency,
p107
aVand I've seen these beautiful trees which had been there for decades,
p108
aVthey've been totally destroyed.
p109
aVSo this is what's happening,
p110
aVbut when we talk about the rising sea level,
p111
aVwe think it's something that happens gradually.
p112
aVIt comes with the winds, it comes with the swells,
p113
aVand so they can be magnified,
p114
aVbut what we are beginning to witness is the change in the weather pattern,
p115
aVwhich is perhaps the more urgent challenge
p116
aVthat we will face sooner than perhaps the rising sea level.
p117
aa(lp118
VCA: So the country is already seeing effects now.
p119
aVAs you look forward,
p120
aVwhat are your options as a country, as a nation?
p121
aa(lp122
VAT: Well, I've been telling this story every year.
p123
aVI think I visit a number of \u2014
p124
aVI've been traveling the world to try and get people to understand.
p125
aVWe have a plan, we think we have a plan.
p126
aVAnd on one occasion, I think I spoke in Geneva
p127
aVand there was a gentleman who was interviewing me
p128
aVon something like this,
p129
aVand I said, "We are looking at floating islands,"
p130
aVand he thought it was funny, but somebody said,
p131
aV"No, this is not funny. These people are looking for solutions."
p132
aVAnd so I have been looking at floating islands.
p133
aVThe Japanese are interested in building floating islands.
p134
aa(lp135
VBut, as a country, we have made a commitment
p136
aVthat no matter what happens, we will try as much as possible
p137
aVto stay and continue to exist as a nation.
p138
aVWhat that will take,
p139
aVit's going to be something quite significant,
p140
aVvery, very substantial.
p141
aVEither we live on floating islands,
p142
aVor we have to build up the islands to continue to stay out of the water
p143
aVas the sea level rises and as the storms get more severe.
p144
aVBut even that, it's going to be very, very difficult
p145
aVto get the kind of resourcing that we would need.
p146
aa(lp147
VCA: And then the only recourse is some form of forced migration.
p148
aa(lp149
VAT: Well, we are also looking at that
p150
aVbecause in the event that nothing comes forward
p151
aVfrom the international community,
p152
aVwe are preparing,
p153
aVwe don't want to be caught like what's happening in Europe.
p154
aVOK? We don't want to mass migrate at some point in time.
p155
aVWe want to be able to give the people the choice today,
p156
aVthose who choose and want to do that, to migrate.
p157
aVWe don't want something to happen that they are forced to migrate
p158
aVwithout having been prepared to do so.
p159
aVOf course, our culture is very different, our society is very different,
p160
aVand once we migrate into a different environment,
p161
aVa different culture,
p162
aVthere's a whole lot of adjustments that are required.
p163
aa(lp164
VCA: Well, there's forced migration in your country's past,
p165
aVand I think just this week,
p166
aVjust yesterday or the day before yesterday,
p167
aVyou visited these people.
p168
aVWhat happened here? What's the story here?
p169
aa(lp170
VAT: Yes, and I'm sorry, I think somebody was asking
p171
aVwhy we were sneaking off to visit that place.
p172
aVI had a very good reason, because we have a community of Kiribati people
p173
aVliving in that part of the Solomon Islands,
p174
aVbut these were people who were relocated from the Phoenix Islands, in fact,
p175
aVin the 1960s.
p176
aVThere was serious drought, and the people could not continue to live on the island,
p177
aVand so they were moved to live here in the Solomon Islands.
p178
aVAnd so yesterday it was very interesting to meet with these people.
p179
aVThey didn't know who I was. They hadn't heard of me.
p180
aVSome of them later recognized me,
p181
aVbut I think they were very happy.
p182
aVLater they really wanted to have the opportunity to welcome me formally.
p183
aVBut I think what I saw yesterday was very interesting
p184
aVbecause here I see our people.
p185
aVI spoke in our language, and of course they spoke back, they replied,
p186
aVbut their accent, they are beginning not to be able to speak Kiribati properly.
p187
aVI saw them, there was this lady with red teeth.
p188
aVShe was chewing betel nuts,
p189
aVand it's not something we do in Kiribati.
p190
aVWe don't chew betel nuts.
p191
aVI met also a family who have married the local people here,
p192
aVand so this is what is happening.
p193
aVAs you go into another community, there are bound to be changes.
p194
aVThere is bound to be a certain loss of identity,
p195
aVand this is what we will be looking for in the future
p196
aVif and when we do migrate.
p197
aa(lp198
VCA: It must have been just an extraordinarily emotional day
p199
aVbecause of these questions about identity,
p200
aVthe joy of seeing you and perhaps an emphasized sense of what they had lost.
p201
aVAnd it's very inspiring to hear you say you're going to fight to the end
p202
aVto try to preserve the nation in a location.
p203
aa(lp204
VAT: This is our wish.
p205
aVNobody wants ever to leave their home,
p206
aVand so it's been a very difficult decision for me.
p207
aVAs a leader, you don't make plans to leave your island, your home,
p208
aVand so I've been asked on a number of occasions,
p209
aV"So how do you feel?"
p210
aVAnd it doesn't feel good at all.
p211
aVIt's an emotional thing, and I've tried to live with it,
p212
aVand I know that on occasions, I'm accused of not trying to solve the problem
p213
aVbecause I can't solve the problem.
p214
aVIt's something that's got to be done collectively.
p215
aa(lp216
VClimate change is a global phenomenon, and as I've often argued,
p217
aVunfortunately, the countries, when we come to the United Nations \u2014
p218
aVI was in a meeting with the Pacific Island Forum countries
p219
aVwhere Australia and New Zealand are also members,
p220
aVand we had an argument.
p221
aVThere was a bit of a story in the news
p222
aVbecause they were arguing that to cut emissions,
p223
aVit would be something that they're unable to do
p224
aVbecause it would affect the industries.
p225
aVAnd so here I was saying,
p226
aVOK, I hear you,
p227
aVI understand what you're saying,
p228
aVbut try also to understand what I'm saying
p229
aVbecause if you do not cut your emissions,
p230
aVthen our survival is on the line.
p231
aVAnd so it's a matter for you to weigh this, these moral issues.
p232
aVIt's about industry as opposed to the survival of a people.
p233
aa(lp234
VCA: You know, I ask you yesterday what made you angry,
p235
aVand you said, "I don't get angry." But then you paused.
p236
aVI think this made you angry.
p237
aa(lp238
VAT: I'd refer you to my earlier statement at the United Nations.
p239
aVI was very angry, very frustrated and then depressed.
p240
aVThere was a sense of futility
p241
aVthat we are fighting a fight that we have no hope of winning.
p242
aVI had to change my approach.
p243
aVI had to become more reasonable
p244
aVbecause I thought people would listen to somebody who was rational,
p245
aVbut I remain radically rational, whatever that is.
p246
aa(lp247
V(Laughter)
p248
aa(lp249
VCA: Now, a core part of your nation's identity is fishing.
p250
aVI think you said pretty much everyone is involved in fishing in some way.
p251
aa(lp252
VAT: Well, we eat fish every day, every day,
p253
aVand I think there is no doubt that our rate of consumption of fish
p254
aVis perhaps the highest in the world.
p255
aVWe don't have a lot of livestock,
p256
aVso it's fish that we depend on.
p257
aa(lp258
VCA: So you're dependent on fish, both at the local level
p259
aVand for the revenues that the country receives
p260
aVfrom the global fishing business for tuna,
p261
aVand yet despite that, a few years ago you took a very radical step.
p262
aVCan you tell us about that?
p263
aVI think something happened right here in the Phoenix Islands.
p264
aa(lp265
VAT: Let me give some of the background of what fish means for us.
p266
aVWe have one of the largest tuna fisheries remaining in the world.
p267
aVIn the Pacific, I think we own something like 60 percent
p268
aVof the remaining tuna fisheries,
p269
aVand it remains relatively healthy for some species, but not all.
p270
aVAnd Kiribati is one of the three major resource owners,
p271
aVtuna resource owners.
p272
aVAnd at the moment, we have been getting
p273
aVsomething like 80 to 90 percent of our revenue
p274
aVfrom access fees, license fees.
p275
aa(lp276
VCA: Of your national revenue.
p277
aa(lp278
VAT: National revenue,
p279
aVwhich drives everything that we do
p280
aVin governments, hospitals, schools and what have you.
p281
aVBut we decided to close this, and it was a very difficult decision.
p282
aVI can assure you, politically, locally, it was not easy,
p283
aVbut I was convinced that we had to do this
p284
aVin order to ensure that the fishery remains sustainable.
p285
aVThere had been some indications that some of the species,
p286
aVin particular the bigeye, was under serious threat.
p287
aVThe yellowfin was also heavily fished.
p288
aVSkipjack remains healthy.
p289
aVAnd so we had to do something like that, and so that was the reason I did that.
p290
aVAnother reason why I did that
p291
aVwas because I had been asking the international community
p292
aVthat in order to deal with climate change, in order to fight climate change,
p293
aVthere has got to be sacrifice, there has got to be commitment.
p294
aVSo in asking the international community to make a sacrifice,
p295
aVI thought we ourselves need to make that sacrifice.
p296
aVAnd so we made the sacrifice.
p297
aVAnd forgoing commercial fishing
p298
aVin the Phoenix Islands protected area
p299
aVwould mean a loss of revenue.
p300
aVWe are still trying to assess what that loss would be
p301
aVbecause we actually closed it off at the beginning of this year,
p302
aVand so we will see by the end of this year
p303
aVwhat it means in terms of the lost revenue.
p304
aa(lp305
VCA: So there's so many things playing into this.
p306
aVOn the one hand, it may prompt healthier fisheries.
p307
aVI mean, how much are you able to move the price up
p308
aVthat you charge for the remaining areas?
p309
aa(lp310
VAT: The negotiations have been very difficult,
p311
aVbut we have managed to raise the cost of a vessel day.
p312
aVFor any vessel to come in to fish for a day,
p313
aVwe have raised the fee from \u2014 it was $6,000 and $8,000,
p314
aVnow to $10,000, $12,000 per vessel day.
p315
aVAnd so there's been that significant increase.
p316
aVBut at the same time, what's important to note is,
p317
aVwhereas in the past these fishing boats
p318
aVmight be fishing in a day and maybe catch 10 tons,
p319
aVnow they're catching maybe 100 tons because they've become so efficient.
p320
aVAnd so we've got to respond likewise.
p321
aVWe've got to be very, very careful because the technology has so improved.
p322
aVThere was a time when the Brazilian fleet moved from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
p323
aVThey couldn't.
p324
aVThey started experimenting if they could, per se.
p325
aVBut now they've got ways of doing it, and they've become so efficient.
p326
aa(lp327
VCA: Can you give us a sense of what it's like in those negotiations?
p328
aVBecause you're up against companies
p329
aVthat have hundreds of millions of dollars at stake, essentially.
p330
aVHow do you hold the line?
p331
aVIs there any advice you can give
p332
aVto other leaders who are dealing with the same companies
p333
aVabout how to get the most for your country,
p334
aVget the most for the fish?
p335
aVWhat advice would you give?
p336
aa(lp337
VAT: Well, I think we focus too often on licensing
p338
aVin order to get the rate of return,
p339
aVbecause what we are getting from license fees
p340
aVis about 10 percent of the landed value of the catch
p341
aVon the side of the wharf, not in the retail shops.
p342
aVAnd we only get about 10 percent.
p343
aVWhat we have been trying to do over the years
p344
aVis actually to increase our participation in the industry,
p345
aVin the harvesting, in the processing,
p346
aVand eventually, hopefully, the marketing.
p347
aVThey're not easy to penetrate,
p348
aVbut we are working towards that,
p349
aVand yes, the answer would be to enhance.
p350
aVIn order to increase our rate of return, we have to become more involved.
p351
aVAnd so we've started doing that,
p352
aVand we have to restructure the industry.
p353
aVWe've got to tell these people that the world has changed.
p354
aVNow we want to produce the fish ourselves.
p355
aa(lp356
VCA: And meanwhile, for your local fishermen,
p357
aVthey are still able to fish,
p358
aVbut what is business like for them?
p359
aVIs it getting harder? Are the waters depleted?
p360
aVOr is that being run on a sustainable basis?
p361
aa(lp362
VAT: For the artisanal fishery,
p363
aVwe do not participate in the commercial fishing activity
p364
aVexcept only to supply the domestic market.
p365
aVThe tuna fishery is really entirely for the foreign market,
p366
aVmostly here in the US, Europe, Japan.
p367
aVSo I am a fisherman, very much,
p368
aVand I used to be able to catch yellowfin.
p369
aVNow it's very, very rare to be able to catch yellowfin
p370
aVbecause they are being lifted out of the water by the hundreds of tons
p371
aVby these purse seiners.
p372
aa(lp373
VCA: So here's a couple of beautiful girls from your country.
p374
aVI mean, as you think about their future,
p375
aVwhat message would you have for them
p376
aVand what message would you have for the world?
p377
aa(lp378
VAT: Well, I've been telling the world that we really have to do something
p379
aVabout what is happening to the climate
p380
aVbecause for us, it's about the future of these children.
p381
aVI have 12 grandchildren, at least.
p382
aVI think I have 12, my wife knows.
p383
aa(lp384
V(Laughter)
p385
aa(lp386
VAnd I think I have eight children.
p387
aVIt's about their future.
p388
aVEvery day I see my grandchildren, about the same age as these young girls,
p389
aVand I do wonder,
p390
aVand I get angry sometimes, yes I do.
p391
aVI wonder what is to become of them.
p392
aVAnd so it's about them
p393
aVthat we should be telling everybody,
p394
aVthat it's not about their own national interest,
p395
aVbecause climate change, regrettably, unfortunately,
p396
aVis viewed by many countries as a national problem. It's not.
p397
aVAnd this is the argument we got into recently with our partners,
p398
aVthe Australians and New Zealanders,
p399
aVbecause they said, "We can't cut any more."
p400
aVThis is what one of the leaders, the Australian leader, said,
p401
aVthat we've done our part, we are cutting back.
p402
aVI said, What about the rest? Why don't you keep it?
p403
aVIf you could keep the rest of your emissions
p404
aVwithin your boundaries, within your borders,
p405
aVwe'd have no question.
p406
aVYou can go ahead as much as you like.
p407
aVBut unfortunately, you're sending it our way,
p408
aVand it's affecting the future of our children.
p409
aVAnd so surely I think that is the heart of the problem of climate change today.
p410
aa(lp411
VWe will be meeting in Paris at the end of this year,
p412
aVbut until we can think of this as a global phenomenon,
p413
aVbecause we create it, individually, as nations,
p414
aVbut it affects everybody else,
p415
aVand yet, we refuse to do anything about it,
p416
aVand we deal with it as a national problem,
p417
aVwhich it is not \u2014 it is a global issue,
p418
aVand it's got to be dealt with collectively.
p419
aa(lp420
VCA: People are incredibly bad at responding to graphs and numbers,
p421
aVand we shut our minds to it.
p422
aVSomehow, to people, we're slightly better at responding to that sometimes.
p423
aVAnd it seems like it's very possible that your nation,
p424
aVdespite, actually because of the intense problems you face,
p425
aVyou may yet be the warning light to the world that shines most visibly,
p426
aVmost powerfully.
p427
aVI just want to thank you,  I'm sure, on behalf of all of us,
p428
aVfor your extraordinary leadership and for being here.
p429
aa(lp430
VMr. President, thank you so much.

VI want to share with you
p5
aVover the next 18 minutes
p6
aVa pretty incredible idea.
p7
aVActually, it's a really big idea.
p8
aVBut to get us started,
p9
aVI want to ask if everyone
p10
aVcould just close your eyes for two seconds
p11
aVand try and think of a technology or a bit of science
p12
aVthat you think has changed the world.
p13
aVNow I bet, in this audience,
p14
aVyou're thinking of some really incredible technology,
p15
aVsome stuff that I haven't even heard of,
p16
aVI'm absolutely sure.
p17
aVBut I'm also sure, pretty sure,
p18
aVthat absolutely nobody is thinking of this.
p19
aVThis is a polio vaccine.
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd it's a great thing actually
p22
aVthat nobody's had to think about it here today
p23
aVbecause it means that we can take this for granted.
p24
aVThis is a great technology.
p25
aVWe can take it completely for granted.
p26
aVBut it wasn't always that way.
p27
aVEven here in California,
p28
aVif we were to go back just a few years,
p29
aVit was a very different story.
p30
aVPeople were terrified of this disease.
p31
aVThey were terrified of polio, and it would cause public panic.
p32
aVAnd it was because of scenes like this.
p33
aVIn this scene,
p34
aVpeople are living in an iron lung.
p35
aVThese are people who were perfectly healthy two or three days before,
p36
aVand then two days later,
p37
aVthey can no longer breathe,
p38
aVand this polio virus has paralyzed
p39
aVnot only their arms and their legs,
p40
aVbut also their breathing muscles.
p41
aVAnd they were going to spend the rest of their lives, usually,
p42
aVin this iron lung to breathe for them.
p43
aa(lp44
VThis disease was terrifying.
p45
aVThere was no cure,
p46
aVand there was no vaccine.
p47
aVThe disease was so terrifying
p48
aVthat the president of the United States
p49
aVlaunched an extraordinary national effort
p50
aVto find a way to stop it.
p51
aVTwenty years later, they succeeded
p52
aVand developed the polio vaccine.
p53
aVIt was hailed as a scientific miracle
p54
aVin the late 1950s.
p55
aVFinally, a vaccine that could stop this awful disease,
p56
aVand here in the United States
p57
aVit had an incredible impact.
p58
aVAs you can see, the virus stopped,
p59
aVand it stopped very, very fast.
p60
aa(lp61
VBut this wasn't the case
p62
aVeverywhere in the world.
p63
aVAnd it happened so fast in the United States, however,
p64
aVthat even just last month Jon Stewart said this:
p65
aa(lp66
V(Video) Jon Stewart: Where is polio still active?
p67
aVBecause I thought that had been eradicated
p68
aVin the way that smallpox had been eradicated.
p69
aa(lp70
VBruce Aylward: Oops. Jon, polio's almost been eradicated.
p71
aVBut the reality is
p72
aVthat polio still exists today.
p73
aVWe made this map for Jon to try to show him exactly where polio still exists.
p74
aVThis is the picture.
p75
aVThere's not very much left in the world.
p76
aVBut the reason there's not very much left
p77
aVis because there's been an extraordinary public/private partnership
p78
aVworking behind the scenes, almost unknown,
p79
aVI'm sure to most of you here today.
p80
aVIt's been working for 20 years
p81
aVto try and eradicate this disease,
p82
aVand it's got it down to these few cases
p83
aVthat you can see here on this graphic.
p84
aa(lp85
VBut just last year,
p86
aVwe had an incredible shock
p87
aVand realized that almost just isn't good enough
p88
aVwith a virus like polio.
p89
aVAnd this is the reason:
p90
aVin two countries
p91
aVthat hadn't had this disease for more than probably a decade,
p92
aVon opposite sides of the globe,
p93
aVthere was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks.
p94
aVHundreds of people were paralyzed.
p95
aVHundreds of people died \u2014
p96
aVchildren as well as adults.
p97
aVAnd in both cases,
p98
aVwe were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses,
p99
aVand we could tell these viruses were not from these countries.
p100
aVThey had come from thousands of miles away.
p101
aVAnd in one case, it originated on another continent.
p102
aVAnd not only that, but when they came into these countries,
p103
aVthen they got on commercial jetliners probably
p104
aVand they traveled even farther
p105
aVto other places like Russia,
p106
aVwhere, for the first time in over a decade last year,
p107
aVchildren were crippled and paralyzed
p108
aVby a disease that they had not seen for years.
p109
aa(lp110
VNow all of these outbreaks that I just showed you,
p111
aVthese are under control now,
p112
aVand it looks like they'll probably stop very, very quickly.
p113
aVBut the message was very clear.
p114
aVPolio is still
p115
aVa devastating, explosive disease.
p116
aVIt's just happening in another part of the world.
p117
aVAnd our big idea
p118
aVis that the scientific miracle of this decade
p119
aVshould be the complete eradication
p120
aVof poliomyelitis.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo I want to tell you a little bit
p123
aVabout what this partnership, the Polio Partnership,
p124
aVis trying to do.
p125
aVWe're not trying to control polio.
p126
aVWe're not trying to get it down to just a few cases,
p127
aVbecause this disease is like a root fire;
p128
aVit can explode again if you don't snuff it out completely.
p129
aVSo what we're looking for
p130
aVis a permanent solution.
p131
aVWe want a world in which every child, just like you guys,
p132
aVcan take for granted
p133
aVa polio-free world.
p134
aVSo we're looking for a permanent solution,
p135
aVand this is where we get lucky.
p136
aVThis is one of the very few viruses in the world
p137
aVwhere there are big enough cracks in its armor
p138
aVthat we can try to do something truly extraordinary.
p139
aVThis virus can only survive in people.
p140
aVIt can't live for a very long time in people.
p141
aVIt doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all.
p142
aVAnd we've got pretty good vaccines, as I've just showed you.
p143
aVSo we are trying
p144
aVto wipe out this virus completely.
p145
aVWhat the polio eradication program is trying to do
p146
aVis to kill the virus itself
p147
aVthat causes polio
p148
aVeverywhere on Earth.
p149
aa(lp150
VNow we don't have a great track record
p151
aVwhen it comes to doing something like this,
p152
aVto eradicating diseases.
p153
aVIt's been tried six times in the last century,
p154
aVand it's been successful exactly once.
p155
aVAnd this is because disease eradication,
p156
aVit's still the venture capital of public health.
p157
aVThe risks are massive,
p158
aVbut the pay-off \u2014
p159
aVeconomic, humanitarian, motivational \u2014
p160
aVit's absolutely huge.
p161
aVOne congressman here in the United States
p162
aVthinks that the entire investment
p163
aVthat the U.S. put into smallpox eradication
p164
aVpays itself off every 26 days \u2014
p165
aVin foregone treatment costs
p166
aVand vaccination costs.
p167
aVAnd if we can finish polio eradication,
p168
aVthe poorest countries in the world
p169
aVare going to save over 50 billion dollars
p170
aVin the next 25 years alone.
p171
aVSo those are the kind of stakes that we're after.
p172
aa(lp173
VBut smallpox eradication was hard;
p174
aVit was very, very hard.
p175
aVAnd polio eradication, in many ways, is even tougher,
p176
aVand there's a few reasons for that.
p177
aVThe first is that,
p178
aVwhen we started trying to eradicate polio
p179
aVabout 20 years ago,
p180
aVmore than twice as many countries were infected
p181
aVthan had been when we started off with smallpox.
p182
aVAnd there were more than 10 times as many people
p183
aVliving in these countries.
p184
aVSo it was a massive effort.
p185
aVThe second challenge we had was \u2014
p186
aVin contrast to the smallpox vaccine,
p187
aVwhich was very stable, and a single dose protected you for life \u2014
p188
aVthe polio vaccine is incredibly fragile.
p189
aVIt deteriorates so quickly in the tropics
p190
aVthat we've had to put this special vaccine monitor
p191
aVon every single vial
p192
aVso that it will change very quickly
p193
aVwhen it's exposed to too much heat,
p194
aVand we can tell that it's not a good vaccine to use on a child \u2014
p195
aVit's not potent; it's not going to protect them.
p196
aVEven then, kids need many doses of the vaccine.
p197
aa(lp198
VBut the third challenge we have \u2014
p199
aVand probably even bigger one, the biggest challenge \u2014
p200
aVis that, in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy \u2014
p201
aVevery single person almost who was infected with smallpox
p202
aVhad this telltale rash.
p203
aVSo you could get around the disease;
p204
aVyou could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off.
p205
aVWith polio it's almost completely different.
p206
aVThe vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus
p207
aVshow absolutely no sign of the disease.
p208
aVSo you can't see the enemy most of the time,
p209
aVand as a result,
p210
aVwe've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio
p211
aVthan what was done with smallpox.
p212
aa(lp213
VWe've had to create
p214
aVone of the largest social movements in history.
p215
aVThere's over 10 million people,
p216
aVprobably 20 million people,
p217
aVlargely volunteers,
p218
aVwho have been working over the last 20 years
p219
aVin what has now been called
p220
aVthe largest internationally-coordinated operation in peacetime.
p221
aVThese people, these 20 million people,
p222
aVvaccinate over 500 million children
p223
aVevery single year,
p224
aVmultiple times
p225
aVat the peak of our operation.
p226
aVNow giving the polio vaccine is simple.
p227
aVIt's just two drops, like that.
p228
aVBut reaching 500 million people
p229
aVis much, much tougher.
p230
aVAnd these vaccinators, these volunteers,
p231
aVthey have got to dive headlong
p232
aVinto some of the toughest, densest
p233
aVurban slums in the world.
p234
aVThey've got to trek under sweltering suns
p235
aVto some of the most remote, difficult to reach places in the world.
p236
aVAnd they also have to dodge bullets,
p237
aVbecause we have got to operate
p238
aVduring shaky cease-fires and truces
p239
aVto try and vaccinate children,
p240
aVeven in areas affected by conflict.
p241
aa(lp242
VOne reporter
p243
aVwho was watching our program in Somalia about five years ago \u2014
p244
aVa place which has eradicated polio,
p245
aVnot once, but twice, because they got reinfected.
p246
aVHe was sitting outside of the road,
p247
aVwatching one of these polio campaigns unfold,
p248
aVand a few months later he wrote:
p249
aV"This is foreign aid at its most heroic."
p250
aVAnd these heroes, they come from every walk of life,
p251
aVall sorts of backgrounds.
p252
aVBut one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International.
p253
aVThis is a group
p254
aVwhose million-strong army of volunteers
p255
aVhave been working to eradicate polio
p256
aVfor over 20 years.
p257
aVThey're right at the center of the whole thing.
p258
aa(lp259
VNow it took years to build up the infrastructure
p260
aVfor polio eradication \u2014
p261
aVmore than 15 years, much longer than it should have \u2014
p262
aVbut once it was built, the results were striking.
p263
aVWithin a couple of years,
p264
aVevery country that started polio eradication
p265
aVrapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses,
p266
aVwith the exception of four countries that you see here.
p267
aVAnd in each of those, it was only part of the country.
p268
aVAnd then, by 1999,
p269
aVone of the three polio viruses
p270
aVthat we were trying to eradicate
p271
aVhad been completely eradicated worldwide \u2014
p272
aVproof of concept.
p273
aVAnd then today,
p274
aVthere's been a 99 percent reduction \u2014
p275
aVgreater than 99 percent reduction \u2014
p276
aVin the number of children
p277
aVwho are being paralyzed by this awful disease.
p278
aVWhen we started, over 20 years ago,
p279
aV1,000 children were being paralyzed
p280
aVevery single day by this virus.
p281
aVLast year, it was 1,000.
p282
aa(lp283
VAnd at the same time,
p284
aVthe polio eradication program
p285
aVhas been working to help with a lot of other areas.
p286
aVIt's been working to help control pandemic flu,
p287
aVSARS for example.
p288
aVIt's also tried to save children by doing other things \u2014
p289
aVgiving vitamin A drops, giving measles shots,
p290
aVgiving bed nets against malaria even
p291
aVduring some of these campaigns.
p292
aVBut the most exciting thing
p293
aVthat the polio eradication program has been doing
p294
aVhas been to force us,
p295
aVthe international community,
p296
aVto reach every single child, every single community,
p297
aVthe most vulnerable people in the world,
p298
aVwith the most basic of health services,
p299
aVirrespective of geography, poverty,
p300
aVculture and even conflict.
p301
aa(lp302
VSo things were looking very exciting,
p303
aVand then about five years ago,
p304
aVthis virus, this ancient virus, started to fight back.
p305
aVThe first problem we ran into
p306
aVwas that, in these last four countries, the strongholds of this virus,
p307
aVwe just couldn't seem to get the virus rooted out.
p308
aVAnd then to make the matters even worse,
p309
aVthe virus started to spread out of these four places,
p310
aVespecially northern India and northern Nigeria,
p311
aVinto much of Africa, Asia, and even into Europe,
p312
aVcausing horrific outbreaks
p313
aVin places that had not seen this disease for decades.
p314
aVAnd then,
p315
aVin one of the most important, tenacious
p316
aVand toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world,
p317
aVwe found that our vaccine was working
p318
aVhalf as well as it should have.
p319
aVIn conditions like this,
p320
aVthe vaccine just couldn't get the grip it needed to
p321
aVin the guts of these children
p322
aVand protect them the way that it needed to.
p323
aa(lp324
VNow at that time,
p325
aVthere was a great, as you can imagine,
p326
aVfrustration \u2014 let's call it frustration \u2014
p327
aVit started to grow very, very quickly.
p328
aVAnd all of a sudden, some very important voices
p329
aVin the world of public health
p330
aVstarted to say, "Hang on.
p331
aVWe should abandon this idea of eradication.
p332
aVLet's settle for control \u2014 that's good enough."
p333
aVNow as seductive as the idea of control sounds,
p334
aVit's a false premise.
p335
aVThe brutal truth is,
p336
aVif we don't have the will or the skill,
p337
aVor even the money that we need
p338
aVto reach children, the most vulnerable children in the world,
p339
aVwith something as simple
p340
aVas an oral polio vaccine,
p341
aVthen pretty soon,
p342
aVmore than 200,000 children
p343
aVare again going to be paralyzed by this disease
p344
aVevery single year.
p345
aVThere's absolutely no question.
p346
aa(lp347
VThese are children like Umar.
p348
aVUmar is seven years old,
p349
aVand he's from northern Nigeria.
p350
aVHe lives in a family home there
p351
aVwith his eight brothers and sisters.
p352
aVUmar also has polio.
p353
aVUmar was paralyzed for life.
p354
aVHis right leg was paralyzed
p355
aVin 2004.
p356
aVThis leg, his right leg,
p357
aVnow takes an awful beating
p358
aVbecause he has to half-crawl,
p359
aVbecause it's faster to move that way
p360
aVto keep up with his friends, keep up with his brothers and sisters,
p361
aVthan to get up on his crutches and walk.
p362
aVBut Umar is a fantastic student. He's an incredible kid.
p363
aVAs you probably can't see the detail here,
p364
aVbut this is his report card,
p365
aVand you'll see, he's got perfect scores.
p366
aVHe got 100 percent in all the important things,
p367
aVlike nursery rhymes, for example there.
p368
aVBut you know I'd love to be able to tell you
p369
aVthat Umar is a typical kid with polio these days,
p370
aVbut it's not true.
p371
aVUmar is an exceptional kid
p372
aVin exceptional circumstances.
p373
aa(lp374
VThe reality of polio today
p375
aVis something very different.
p376
aVPolio strikes the poorest communities in the world.
p377
aVIt leaves their children paralyzed,
p378
aVand it drags their families
p379
aVdeeper into poverty,
p380
aVbecause they're desperately searching
p381
aVand they're desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have,
p382
aVtrying in vain
p383
aVto find a cure for their children.
p384
aVWe think children deserve better.
p385
aVAnd so when the going got really tough
p386
aVin the polio eradication program
p387
aVabout two years ago,
p388
aVwhen people were saying, "We should call it off,"
p389
aVthe Polio Partnership
p390
aVdecided to buckle down once again
p391
aVand try and find innovative new solutions,
p392
aVnew ways to get to the children
p393
aVthat we were missing again and again.
p394
aa(lp395
VIn northern India, we started mapping the cases
p396
aVusing satellite imaging like this,
p397
aVso that we could guide our investments and vaccinator shelters,
p398
aVso we could get to the millions of children
p399
aVon the Koshi River basin
p400
aVwhere there are no other health services.
p401
aVIn northern Nigeria,
p402
aVthe political leaders and the traditional Muslim leaders,
p403
aVthey got directly involved in the program
p404
aVto help solve the problems of logistics
p405
aVand community confidence.
p406
aa(lp407
VAnd now they've even started using these devices \u2014
p408
aVspeaking of cool technology \u2014
p409
aVthese little devices, little GIS trackers like this,
p410
aVwhich they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccinators.
p411
aVAnd then they can track them,
p412
aVand at the end of the day, they look and see,
p413
aVdid these guys get every single street, every single house.
p414
aVThis is the kind of commitment now we're seeing
p415
aVto try and reach all of the children we've been missing.
p416
aVAnd in Afghanistan, we're trying new approaches \u2014
p417
aVaccess negotiators.
p418
aVWe're working closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross
p419
aVto ensure that we can reach every child.
p420
aa(lp421
VBut as we tried these extraordinary things,
p422
aVas people went to this trouble
p423
aVto try and rework their tactics,
p424
aVwe went back to the vaccine \u2014 it's a 50-year-old vaccine \u2014
p425
aVand we thought, surely we can make a better vaccine,
p426
aVso that when they finally get to these kids,
p427
aVwe can have a better bang for our buck.
p428
aVAnd this started an incredible collaboration with industry,
p429
aVand within six months,
p430
aVwe were testing a new polio vaccine
p431
aVthat targeted, just two years ago,
p432
aVthe last two types of polio in the world.
p433
aVNow June the ninth, 2009,
p434
aVwe got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine,
p435
aVand it turned out to be a game-changer.
p436
aVThe new vaccine
p437
aVhad twice the impact on these last couple of viruses
p438
aVas the old vaccine had,
p439
aVand we immediately started using this.
p440
aVWell, in a couple of months we had to get it out of production.
p441
aVAnd it started rolling off the production lines
p442
aVand into the mouths of children around the world.
p443
aVAnd we didn't start with the easy places.
p444
aVThe first place this vaccine was used
p445
aVwas in southern Afghanistan,
p446
aVbecause it's in places like that
p447
aVwhere kids are going to benefit the most
p448
aVfrom technologies like this.
p449
aa(lp450
VNow here at TED, over the last couple of days,
p451
aVI've seen people challenging the audience again and again
p452
aVto believe in the impossible.
p453
aVSo this morning at about seven o'clock,
p454
aVI decided that we'd try to drive Chris
p455
aVand the production crew here berserk
p456
aVby downloading all of our data from India again,
p457
aVso that you could see something
p458
aVthat's just unfolding today,
p459
aVwhich proves that the impossible is possible.
p460
aVAnd only two years ago, people were saying that this is impossible.
p461
aVNow remember, northern India is the perfect storm
p462
aVwhen it comes to polio.
p463
aVOver 500,000 children
p464
aVare born in the two states that have never stopped polio \u2014
p465
aVUttar Pradesh and Bihar \u2014

aV500,000 children every single month.
p467
aVSanitation is terrible,
p468
aVand our old vaccine, you remember,
p469
aVworked half as well as it should have.
p470
aVAnd yet, the impossible is happening.
p471
aVToday marks exactly six months \u2014
p472
aVand for the first time in history,
p473
aVnot a single child has been paralyzed
p474
aVin Uttar Pradesh or Bihar.
p475
aa(lp476
V(Applause)
p477
aa(lp478
VIndia's not unique.
p479
aVIn Umar's home country of Nigeria,
p480
aVa 95 percent reduction
p481
aVin the number of children paralyzed by polio last year.
p482
aVAnd in the last six months,
p483
aVwe've had less places reinfected by polio
p484
aVthan at any other time in history.
p485
aa(lp486
VLadies and gentlemen, with a combination
p487
aVof smart people, smart technology
p488
aVand smart investments,
p489
aVpolio can now be eradicated anywhere.
p490
aVWe have major challenges, you can imagine,
p491
aVto finish this job,
p492
aVbut as you've also seen,
p493
aVit's doable,
p494
aVit has great secondary benefits,
p495
aVand polio eradication is a great buy.
p496
aVAnd as long as any child anywhere
p497
aVis paralyzed by this virus,
p498
aVit's a stark reminder
p499
aVthat we are failing, as a society, to reach children
p500
aVwith the most basic of services.
p501
aVAnd for that reason, polio eradication:
p502
aVit's the ultimate in equity
p503
aVand it's the ultimate in social justice.
p504
aVThe huge social movement
p505
aVthat's been involved in polio eradication
p506
aVis ready to do way more for these children.
p507
aVIt's ready to reach them with bed nets, with other things.
p508
aVBut capitalizing on their enthusiasm,
p509
aVcapitalizing on their energy
p510
aVmeans finishing the job
p511
aVthat they started 20 years ago.
p512
aa(lp513
VFinishing polio is a smart thing to do,
p514
aVand it's the right thing to do.
p515
aVNow we're in tough times economically.
p516
aVBut as David Cameron of the United Kingdom
p517
aVsaid about a month ago when he was talking about polio,
p518
aV"There's never a wrong time
p519
aVto do the right thing."
p520
aVFinishing polio eradication
p521
aVis the right thing to do.
p522
aVAnd we are at a crossroads right now
p523
aVin this great effort over the last 20 years.
p524
aVWe have a new vaccine,
p525
aVwe have new resolve,
p526
aVand we have new tactics.
p527
aVWe have the chance
p528
aVto write an entirely new polio-free chapter
p529
aVin human history.
p530
aVBut if we blink now,
p531
aVwe will lose forever
p532
aVthe chance to eradicate an ancient disease.
p533
aVHere's a great idea to spread:
p534
aVEnd polio now.
p535
aVHelp us tell the story.
p536
aVHelp us build the momentum
p537
aVso that very soon
p538
aVevery child, every parent
p539
aVeverywhere
p540
aVcan also take for granted
p541
aVa polio-free life forever.
p542
aa(lp543
VThank you.
p544
aa(lp545
V(Applause)
p546
aa(lp547
VBill Gates: Well Bruce, where do you think the toughest places are going to be?
p548
aVWhere would you say we need to be the smartest?
p549
aa(lp550
VBA: The four places where you saw, that we've never stopped \u2014
p551
aVnorthern Nigeria, northern India,
p552
aVthe southern corner of Afghanistan
p553
aVand bordering areas of Pakistan \u2014
p554
aVthey're going to be the toughest.
p555
aVBut the interesting thing is, of those three,
p556
aVIndia's looking real good, as you just saw in the data.
p557
aVAnd Afghanistan, Afghanistan, we think
p558
aVhas probably stopped polio repeatedly.
p559
aVIt keeps getting reinfected.
p560
aVSo the tough ones: going to get the top of Nigeria finished
p561
aVand getting Pakistan finished.
p562
aVThey're going to be the tough ones.
p563
aa(lp564
VBG: Now what about the money?
p565
aVGive us a sense of how much the campaign costs a year.
p566
aVAnd is it easy to raise that money?
p567
aVAnd what's it going to be like the next couple of years?
p568
aa(lp569
VBA: It's interesting.
p570
aVWe spend right now about 750 million
p571
aVto 800 million dollars a year.
p572
aVThat's what it costs to reach 500 million children.
p573
aVIt sounds like a lot of money; it is a lot of money.
p574
aVBut when you're reaching 500 million children multiple times \u2014
p575
aV20, 30 cents to reach a child \u2014
p576
aVthat's not very much money.
p577
aVBut right now we don't have enough of that.
p578
aVWe have a big gap in that money. We're cutting corners,
p579
aVand every time we cut corners,
p580
aVmore places get infected that shouldn't have, and it just slows us down.
p581
aVAnd that great buy costs us a little bit more.
p582
aa(lp583
VBG: Well, hopefully we'll get the word out,
p584
aVand the governments will keep their generosity up.
p585
aVSo good luck. We're all in this with you.
p586
aVThank you. (BA: Thank you.)

In 2014,&nbsp;only three countries remained polio-endemic.</p>        <p>He says: &quot;It&#39;s been estimated that our investment in smallpox eradication pays off every 26 days.&quot;</p>        <p>Since 2011, Aylward has also led WHO&rsquo;s work in preparedness, readiness and response to health emergencies. By developing global strategies, analyzing health trends and advising on policies and country collaboration, the WHO helps make sure that outbreaks &mdash; like the 2014 ebola epidemic &mdash; stay under control.&nbsp;</p>", "slug": "bruce_aylward", "whotheyare": "As the Assistant Director-General of the World Health Organization\\u2019s Polio and Emergencies Cluster, Bruce Aylward works to ensure that polio stays under control and that the world is prepared to respond to health crises.", "whatotherssay": "Bruce Aylward is making us all root for a polio-free world.", "id": 928, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/c0458177eda0f1df1d73ab38d6a7d1e50b7ee7de_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "How we\'ll stop polio for good", "take_action": [{"status": "approved", "start_at": null, "link_url": "http://www.endpolio.org/take-action", "eyebrow": null, "end_at": null, "verb": "join", "published": true, "visible_url": "endpolio.org", "type": "take_action", "blurb": "**Join** the movement to eradicate polio."}], "comments": 4186, "more_resources": [{"status": "approved", "start_at": null, "headline": "We are 99 percent of the way to eliminating polio globally", "link_url": "http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/polio/facts/en/", "eyebrow": null, "end_at": null, "image_url": "", "published": true, "visible_url": "", "type": "external_website", "blurb": "Find out more about the path to a polio-free chapter of human history with this fact sheet from the World Health Organization."}], "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/55e8224d694fec895e6f95aa6fad6ee7fe091bb7_800x600.jpg", "description": "Polio is almost completely eradicated.

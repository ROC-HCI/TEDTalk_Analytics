VNow when we think of our senses,
p5
aVwe don't usually think of the reasons
p6
aVwhy they probably evolved, from a biological perspective.
p7
aVWe don't really think of the evolutionary need
p8
aVto be protected by our senses,
p9
aVbut that's probably why our senses really evolved \u2014
p10
aVto keep us safe, to allow us to live.
p11
aVReally when we think of our senses,
p12
aVor when we think of the loss of the sense,
p13
aVwe really think about something more like this:
p14
aVthe ability to touch something luxurious, to taste something delicious,
p15
aVto smell something fragrant,
p16
aVto see something beautiful.
p17
aVThis is what we want out of our senses.
p18
aVWe want beauty; we don't just want function.
p19
aVAnd when it comes to sensory restoration,
p20
aVwe're still very far away from being able to provide beauty.
p21
aVAnd that's what I'd like to talk to you a little bit about today.
p22
aa(lp23
VLikewise for hearing.
p24
aVWhen we think about why we hear,
p25
aVwe don't often think about the ability to hear an alarm or a siren,
p26
aValthough clearly that's an important thing.
p27
aVReally what we want to hear is music.
p28
aa(lp29
V(Music)
p30
aa(lp31
VSo many of you know that that's Beethoven's Seventh Symphony.
p32
aVMany of you know that he was deaf, or near profoundly deaf,
p33
aVwhen he wrote that.
p34
aVNow I'd like to impress upon you
p35
aVhow unusual it is that we can hear music.
p36
aVMusic is just one of the strangest things that there is.
p37
aVIt's acoustic vibrations in the air,
p38
aVlittle waves of energy in the air that tickle our eardrum.
p39
aVSomehow in tickling our eardrum
p40
aVthat transmits energy down our hearing bones,
p41
aVwhich get converted to a fluid impulse inside the cochlea
p42
aVand then somehow converted into an electrical signal in our auditory nerves
p43
aVthat somehow wind up in our brains
p44
aVas a perception of a song or a beautiful piece of music.
p45
aVThat process is entirely abstract and very, very unusual.
p46
aVAnd we could discuss that topic alone for days
p47
aVto really try to figure out, how is it that we hear something that's emotional
p48
aVfrom something that starts out as a vibration in the air?
p49
aa(lp50
VTurns out that if you have hearing loss,
p51
aVmost people that lose their hearing
p52
aVlose it at what's called the cochlea, the inner ear.
p53
aVAnd it's at the hair cell level that they do this.
p54
aVNow if you had to pick a sense to lose,
p55
aVI have to be very honest with you
p56
aVand say, we're better at restoring hearing
p57
aVthan we are at restoring any sense that there is.
p58
aVIn fact, nothing even actually comes close
p59
aVto our ability to restore hearing.
p60
aVAnd as a physician and a surgeon, I can confidently tell my patients
p61
aVthat if you had to pick a sense to lose,
p62
aVwe are the furthest along medically and surgically with hearing.
p63
aVAs a musician, I can tell you
p64
aVthat if I had to have a cochlear implant,
p65
aVI'd be heartbroken. I'd just be plainly heartbroken,
p66
aVbecause I know that music would never sound the same to me.
p67
aa(lp68
VNow this is a video that I'm going to show you
p69
aVof a girl who's born deaf.
p70
aVShe's in a very supportive environment.
p71
aVHer mother's doing everything she can.
p72
aVOkay, play that video please.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Video) Mother: That's an owl.
p75
aVOwl, yeah.
p76
aVOwl. Owl.
p77
aVYeah.
p78
aVBaby. Baby.
p79
aVYou want it?
p80
aV(Kiss)
p81
aa(lp82
VCharles Limb: Now despite everything going for this child
p83
aVin terms of family support
p84
aVand simple infused learning,
p85
aVthere is a limitation to what a child who's deaf, an infant who was born deaf,
p86
aVhas in this world
p87
aVin terms of social, educational, vocational opportunities.
p88
aVI'm not saying that they can't live a beautiful, wonderful life.
p89
aVI'm saying that they're going to face obstacles
p90
aVthat most people who have normal hearing will not have to face.
p91
aa(lp92
VNow hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss
p93
aVhas really evolved in the past 200 years.
p94
aVI mean literally,
p95
aVthey used to do things like stick ear-shaped objects onto your ears
p96
aVand stick funnels in.
p97
aVAnd that was the best you could do for hearing loss.
p98
aVBack then you couldn't even look at the eardrum.
p99
aVSo it's not too surprising
p100
aVthat there were no good treatments for hearing loss.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd now today we have the modern multi-channel cochlear implant,
p103
aVwhich is an outpatient procedure.
p104
aVIt's surgically placed inside the inner ear.
p105
aVIt takes about an hour and a half to two hours, depending on where it's done,
p106
aVunder general anesthesia.
p107
aVAnd in the end, you achieve something like this
p108
aVwhere an electrode array is inserted inside the cochlea.
p109
aVNow actually, this is quite crude
p110
aVin comparison to our regular inner ear.
p111
aa(lp112
VBut here is that same girl who is implanted now.
p113
aVThis is her 10 years later.
p114
aVAnd this is a video that was taken
p115
aVby my surgical mentor, Dr. John Niparko, who implanted her.
p116
aVIf we could play this video please.
p117
aa(lp118
V(Video) John Niparko: So you've written two books?
p119
aa(lp120
VGirl: I have written two books. (Mother: Was the other one a book or a journal entry?)
p121
aVGirl: No, the other one was a book. (Mother: Oh, okay.)
p122
aa(lp123
VJN: Well this book has seven chapters,
p124
aVand the last chapter
p125
aVis entitled "The Good Things About Being Deaf."
p126
aVDo you remember writing that chapter?
p127
aa(lp128
VGirl: Yes I do. I remember writing every chapter.
p129
aa(lp130
VJN: Yeah.
p131
aVGirl: Well sometimes my sister can be kind of annoying.
p132
aVSo it comes in handy to not be annoyed by her.
p133
aa(lp134
VJN: I see. And who is that?
p135
aa(lp136
VGirl: Holly. (JN: Okay.)
p137
aa(lp138
VMother: Her sister. (JN: Her sister.) Girl: My sister.
p139
aa(lp140
VJN: And how can you avoid being annoyed by her?
p141
aa(lp142
VGirl: I just take off my CI, and I don't hear anything.
p143
aV(Laughter)
p144
aVIt comes in handy.
p145
aa(lp146
VJN: So you don't want to hear everything that's out there?
p147
aa(lp148
VGirl: No.
p149
aa(lp150
VCL: And so she's phenomenal.
p151
aVAnd there's no way that you can't look at that as an overwhelming success.
p152
aVIt is. It's a huge success story in modern medicine.
p153
aVHowever, despite this incredible facility
p154
aVthat some cochlear implant users display with language,
p155
aVyou turn on the radio and all of a sudden they can't hear music almost at all.
p156
aVIn fact, most implant users really struggle
p157
aVand dislike music because it sounds so bad.
p158
aVAnd so when it comes to this idea
p159
aVof restoring beauty to somebody's life,
p160
aVwe have a long way to go when it comes to audition.
p161
aa(lp162
VNow there are a lot of reasons for that.
p163
aVI mentioned earlier the fact
p164
aVthat music is a different capacity because it's abstract.
p165
aVLanguage is very different. Language is very precise.
p166
aVIn fact, the whole reason we use it
p167
aVis because it has semantic-specificity.
p168
aVWhen you say a word,
p169
aVwhat you care is that word was perceived correctly.
p170
aVYou don't care that the word sounded pretty
p171
aVwhen it was spoken.
p172
aa(lp173
VMusic is entirely different.
p174
aVWhen you hear music, if it doesn't sound good, what's the point?
p175
aVThere's really very little point in listening to music
p176
aVwhen it doesn't sound good to you.
p177
aVThe acoustics of music are much harder than those of language.
p178
aVAnd you can see on this figure,
p179
aVthat the frequency range
p180
aVand the decibel range, the dynamic range of music
p181
aVis far more heterogeneous.
p182
aVSo if we had to design a perfect cochlear implant,
p183
aVwhat we would try to do
p184
aVis target it to be able to allow music transmission.
p185
aVBecause I always view music as the pinnacle of hearing.
p186
aVIf you can hear music,
p187
aVyou should be able to hear anything.
p188
aa(lp189
VNow the problems begin first with pitch perception.
p190
aVI mean, most of us know that pitch is a fundamental building block of music.
p191
aVAnd without the ability to perceive pitch well,
p192
aVmusic and melody is a very difficult thing to do \u2014
p193
aVforget about a harmony and things like that.
p194
aVNow this is a MIDI arrangement of Rachmaninoff's Prelude.
p195
aVNow if we could just play this.
p196
aa(lp197
V(Music)
p198
aa(lp199
VOkay, now if we consider
p200
aVthat in a cochlear implant patient
p201
aVpitch perception could be off as much as two octaves,
p202
aVlet's see what happens here
p203
aVwhen we randomize this to within one semitone.
p204
aVWe would be thrilled if we had one semitone pitch perception in cochlear implant users.
p205
aVGo ahead and play this one.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Music)
p208
aa(lp209
VNow my goal in showing you that
p210
aVis to show you that music is not robust to degradation.
p211
aVYou distort it a little bit, especially in terms of pitch, and you've changed it.
p212
aVAnd it might be that you kind of like that.
p213
aVThat's kind of hypnotic.
p214
aVBut it certainly wasn't the way the music was intended.
p215
aVAnd you're not hearing the same thing
p216
aVthat most people who have normal hearing are hearing.
p217
aa(lp218
VNow the other issue comes with,
p219
aVnot just the ability to tell pitches apart,
p220
aVbut the ability to tell sounds apart.
p221
aVMost cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between an instrument.
p222
aVIf we could play these two sound clips in succession.
p223
aV(Trumpet)
p224
aVThe trumpet.
p225
aVAnd the second one.
p226
aV(Violin)
p227
aVThat's a violin.
p228
aVThese have similar wave forms. They're both sustained instruments.
p229
aVCochlear implant users cannot tell the difference
p230
aVbetween these instruments.
p231
aVThe sound quality, or the sound of the sound
p232
aVis how I like to describe timbre, tone color \u2014
p233
aVthey cannot tell these things whatsoever.
p234
aVThis implant is not transmitting
p235
aVthe quality of music that usually provides things like warmth.
p236
aa(lp237
VNow if you look at the brain of an individual who has a cochlear implant
p238
aVand you have them listen to speech,
p239
aVhave them listen to rhythm and have them listen to melody,
p240
aVwhat you find is that the auditory cortex
p241
aVis the most active during speech.
p242
aVYou would think that because these implants are optimized for speech,
p243
aVthey were designed for speech.
p244
aVBut actually if you look at melody,
p245
aVwhat you find is that there's very little cortical activity
p246
aVin implant users compared with normal hearing controls.
p247
aVSo for whatever reason,
p248
aVthis implant is not successfully stimulating auditory cortices
p249
aVduring melody perception.
p250
aa(lp251
VNow the next question is,
p252
aVwell how does it really sound?
p253
aVNow we've been doing some studies
p254
aVto really get a sense of what sound quality is like for these implant users.
p255
aVI'm going to play you two clips of Usher,
p256
aVone which is normal
p257
aVand one which has almost no high frequencies, almost no low frequencies
p258
aVand not even that many mid frequencies.
p259
aVGo ahead and play that.
p260
aa(lp261
V(Music)
p262
aa(lp263
V(Limited Frequency Music)
p264
aa(lp265
VI had patients tell me that those sound the same.
p266
aVThey cannot differentiate sound quality differences
p267
aVbetween those two clips.
p268
aVAgain, we are very, very far away in just getting to where we want to get to.
p269
aa(lp270
VNow the question comes to mind: Is there any hope?
p271
aVAnd yes, there is hope.
p272
aVNow I don't know if anybody knows who this is.
p273
aVThis is ... does somebody know?
p274
aVThis is Beethoven.
p275
aVNow why would we know what Beethoven's skull looks like?
p276
aVBecause his grave was exhumed.
p277
aVAnd it turns out that his temporal bones were harvested when he died
p278
aVto try to look at the cause of his deafness,
p279
aVwhich is why he has molding clay
p280
aVand his skull is bulging out on the side there.
p281
aVBut Beethoven composed music
p282
aVlong after he lost his hearing.
p283
aVWhat that suggests is that, even in the case of hearing loss,
p284
aVthe capacity for music remains.
p285
aVThe brains remain hardwired for music.
p286
aa(lp287
VI've been very lucky to work with Dr. David Ryugo
p288
aVwhere I've been working on deaf cats that are white
p289
aVand trying to figure out what happens when we give them cochlear implants.
p290
aVThis is a cat that's been trained to respond to a trumpet for food.
p291
aa(lp292
V(Music)
p293
aa(lp294
VText: Beethoven doesn't excite her.
p295
aV(Music)
p296
aVThe "1812 Overture" isn't worth waking for.
p297
aV(Trumpet)
p298
aVBut she jumps to action when called to duty!
p299
aV(Trumpet)
p300
aa(lp301
VCL: Now I'm not suggesting
p302
aVthat the cat is hearing that trumpet the way we're hearing it.
p303
aVI'm suggesting that with training
p304
aVyou can imbue a musical sound with significance,
p305
aVeven in a cat.
p306
aVIf we were to direct efforts
p307
aVtowards training cochlear implant users to hear music \u2014
p308
aVbecause right now there's virtually no effort put towards that,
p309
aVno rehabilitative strategies,
p310
aVvery little in the way of technological advances to actually improve music \u2014
p311
aVwe would come a long way.
p312
aa(lp313
VNow I want to show you one last video.
p314
aVAnd this is of a student of mine named Joseph
p315
aVwho I had the good fortune to work with for three years in my lab.
p316
aVHe's deaf, and he learned to play the piano
p317
aVafter he received the cochlear implant.
p318
aVAnd here's a video of Joseph.
p319
aa(lp320
V(Music)
p321
aa(lp322
V(Video) Joseph: I was born in 1986.
p323
aVAnd at about four months old,
p324
aVI was diagnosed with profoundly severe hearing loss.
p325
aVNot long after,
p326
aVI was fitted with hearing aids.
p327
aVBut although these hearing aids
p328
aVwere the most powerful hearing aids on the market at the time,
p329
aVthey weren't very helpful.
p330
aVSo as a result, I had to rely on lip reading a lot,
p331
aVand I couldn't really hear what people were saying.
p332
aVWhen I was 12 years old,
p333
aVI was one of the first few people in Singapore
p334
aVwho underwent cochlear implantation.
p335
aVAnd not long after I got my cochlear implant,
p336
aVI started learning how to play piano.
p337
aVAnd it was absolutely wonderful.
p338
aVSince then, I've never looked back.
p339
aa(lp340
VCL: Joseph is phenomenal. He's brilliant.
p341
aVHe is now a medical student at Yale University,
p342
aVand he's contemplating a surgical career \u2014
p343
aVone of the first deaf individuals to consider a career in surgery.
p344
aVThere are almost no deaf surgeons anywhere.
p345
aVAnd this is really unheard of stuff, and this is all because of this technology.
p346
aVAnd the fact that he can play the piano like that
p347
aVis a testament to his brain.
p348
aVTruth of the matter is you can play the piano without a cochlear implant,
p349
aVbecause all you have to do is press the keys at the right time.
p350
aVYou don't actually have to hear it.
p351
aVI know he doesn't hear well, because I've heard him do Karaoke.
p352
aV(Laughter)
p353
aVAnd it's one of the most awful things \u2014
p354
aVheartwarming, but awful.
p355
aV(Laughter)
p356
aVAnd so there is certainly a lot of hope,
p357
aVbut there's a lot more that needs to be done.
p358
aa(lp359
VSo I just want to conclude with the following words.
p360
aVWhen it comes to restoration of hearing,
p361
aVwe have certainly come a long way, a remarkably long way.
p362
aVAnd we have a much longer way to go
p363
aVwhen it comes to the idea of restoring perfect hearing.
p364
aVAnd let me tell you right now,
p365
aVit's fine that we would all be very happy with speech.
p366
aVBut I tell you, if we lost our hearing,
p367
aVif anyone here suddenly lost your hearing,
p368
aVyou would want perfect hearing back.
p369
aVYou wouldn't want decent hearing, you would want perfect hearing.
p370
aVRestoration of basic sensory function is critical.
p371
aVAnd I don't mean to understate
p372
aVhow important it is to restore basic function.
p373
aVBut it's really restoration of the ability to perceive beauty
p374
aVwhere we can get inspiring.
p375
aVAnd I don't think that we should give up on beauty.
p376
aa(lp377
VAnd I want to thank you for your time.
p378
aa(lp379
V(Applause)

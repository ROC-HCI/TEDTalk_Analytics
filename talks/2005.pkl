VAs a student of adversity,
p5
aVI've been struck over the years by how some people with major challenges
p6
aVseem to draw strength from them.
p7
aVAnd I've heard the popular wisdom that that has to do with finding meaning.
p8
aVAnd for a long time,
p9
aVI thought the meaning was out there,
p10
aVsome great truth waiting to be found.
p11
aa(lp12
VBut over time,
p13
aVI've come to feel that the truth is irrelevant.
p14
aVWe call it "finding meaning,"
p15
aVbut we might better call it "forging meaning."
p16
aa(lp17
VMy last book was about how families manage to deal
p18
aVwith various kinds of challenging or unusual offspring.
p19
aVAnd one of the mothers I interviewed,
p20
aVwho had two children with multiple severe disabilities,
p21
aVsaid to me, "People always give us these little sayings like,
p22
aV'God doesn't give you any more than you can handle.'
p23
aVBut children like ours are not preordained as a gift.
p24
aVThey're a gift
p25
aVbecause that's what we have chosen."
p26
aa(lp27
VWe make those choices all our lives.
p28
aVWhen I was in second grade,
p29
aVBobby Finkel had a birthday party
p30
aVand invited everyone in our class but me.
p31
aVMy mother assumed there had been some sort of error,
p32
aVand she called Mrs. Finkel,
p33
aVwho said that Bobby didn't like me and didn't want me at his party.
p34
aVAnd that day, my mom took me to the zoo
p35
aVand out for a hot fudge sundae.
p36
aVWhen I was in seventh grade,
p37
aVone of the kids on my school bus nicknamed me "Percy,"
p38
aVas a shorthand for my demeanor.
p39
aVAnd sometimes, he and his cohort would chant that provocation
p40
aVthe entire school bus ride,
p41
aV45 minutes up, 45 minutes back:
p42
aV"Percy! Percy! Percy! Percy!"
p43
aVWhen I was in eighth grade, our science teacher told us
p44
aVthat all male homosexuals develop fecal incontinence
p45
aVbecause of the trauma to their anal sphincter.
p46
aVAnd I graduated high school without ever going to the cafeteria,
p47
aVwhere I would have sat with the girls and been laughed at for doing so,
p48
aVor sat with the boys,
p49
aVand been laughed at for being a boy who should be sitting with the girls.
p50
aa(lp51
VI survived that childhood through a mix of avoidance and endurance.
p52
aVWhat I didn't know then
p53
aVand do know now,
p54
aVis that avoidance and endurance can be the entryway to forging meaning.
p55
aVAfter you've forged meaning,
p56
aVyou need to incorporate that meaning into a new identity.
p57
aVYou need to take the traumas
p58
aVand make them part of who you've come to be,
p59
aVand you need to fold the worst events of your life
p60
aVinto a narrative of triumph,
p61
aVevincing a better self in response to things that hurt.
p62
aa(lp63
VOne of the other mothers I interviewed when I was working on my book
p64
aVhad been raped as an adolescent,
p65
aVand had a child following that rape,
p66
aVwhich had thrown away her career plans
p67
aVand damaged all of her emotional relationships.
p68
aVBut when I met her, she was 50,
p69
aVand I said to her,
p70
aV"Do you often think about the man who raped you?"
p71
aVAnd she said, "I used to think about him with anger,
p72
aVbut now only with pity."
p73
aVAnd I thought she meant pity because he was so unevolved
p74
aVas to have done this terrible thing.
p75
aVAnd I said, "Pity?"
p76
aVAnd she said, "Yes,
p77
aVbecause he has a beautiful daughter and two beautiful grandchildren,
p78
aVand he doesn't know that,
p79
aVand I do.
p80
aVSo as it turns out,
p81
aVI'm the lucky one."
p82
aa(lp83
VSome of our struggles are things we're born to:
p84
aVour gender, our sexuality, our race, our disability.
p85
aVAnd some are things that happen to us:
p86
aVbeing a political prisoner, being a rape victim,
p87
aVbeing a Katrina survivor.
p88
aVIdentity involves entering a community
p89
aVto draw strength from that community,
p90
aVand to give strength there, too.
p91
aVIt involves substituting "and" for "but" \u2014
p92
aVnot "I am here but I have cancer,"
p93
aVbut rather, "I have cancer and I am here."
p94
aa(lp95
VWhen we're ashamed, we can't tell our stories,
p96
aVand stories are the foundation
p97
aVof identity.
p98
aVForge meaning,
p99
aVbuild identity.
p100
aVForge meaning and build identity.
p101
aVThat became my mantra.
p102
aVForging meaning is about changing yourself.
p103
aVBuilding identity is about changing the world.
p104
aVAll of us with stigmatized identities face this question daily:
p105
aVHow much to accommodate society by constraining ourselves,
p106
aVand how much to break the limits
p107
aVof what constitutes a valid life?
p108
aVForging meaning and building identity
p109
aVdoes not make what was wrong right.
p110
aVIt only makes what was wrong precious.
p111
aa(lp112
VIn January of this year,
p113
aVI went to Myanmar to interview political prisoners,
p114
aVand I was surprised to find them less bitter than I'd anticipated.
p115
aVMost of them had knowingly committed the offenses
p116
aVthat landed them in prison,
p117
aVand they had walked in with their heads held high,
p118
aVand they walked out with their heads still held high,
p119
aVmany years later.
p120
aVDr. Ma Thida, a leading human rights activist
p121
aVwho had nearly died in prison
p122
aVand had spent many years in solitary confinement,
p123
aVtold me she was grateful to her jailers for the time she had had to think,
p124
aVfor the wisdom she had gained,
p125
aVfor the chance to hone her meditation skills.
p126
aVShe had sought meaning
p127
aVand made her travail into a crucial identity.
p128
aVBut if the people I met were less bitter than I'd anticipated
p129
aVabout being in prison,
p130
aVthey were also less thrilled than I'd expected
p131
aVabout the reform process going on in their country.
p132
aVMa Thida said,
p133
aV"We Burmese are noted for our tremendous grace under pressure,
p134
aVbut we also have grievance under glamour."
p135
aVShe said, "And the fact that there have been these shifts and changes
p136
aVdoesn't erase the continuing problems in our society
p137
aVthat we learned to see so well while we were in prison."
p138
aa(lp139
VI understood her to be saying
p140
aVthat concessions confer only a little humanity
p141
aVwhere full humanity is due;
p142
aVthat crumbs are not the same as a place at the table.
p143
aVWhich is to say,
p144
aVyou can forge meaning and build identity
p145
aVand still be mad as hell.
p146
aa(lp147
VI've never been raped,
p148
aVand I've never been in anything remotely approaching a Burmese prison.
p149
aVBut as a gay American,
p150
aVI've experienced prejudice and even hatred,
p151
aVand I've forged meaning
p152
aVand I've built identity,
p153
aVwhich is a move I learned from people
p154
aVwho had experienced far worse privation than I've ever known.
p155
aVIn my own adolescence,
p156
aVI went to extreme lengths to try to be straight.
p157
aVI enrolled myself in something called "sexual surrogacy therapy,"
p158
aVin which people I was encouraged to call doctors
p159
aVprescribed what I was encouraged to call exercises
p160
aVwith women I was encouraged to call surrogates,
p161
aVwho were not exactly prostitutes
p162
aVbut who were also not exactly anything else.
p163
aa(lp164
V(Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
VMy particular favorite was a blonde woman from the Deep South
p167
aVwho eventually admitted to me that she was really a necrophiliac,
p168
aVand had taken this job after she got in trouble
p169
aVdown at the morgue.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VThese experiences eventually allowed me to have
p174
aVsome happy physical relationships with women,
p175
aVfor which I'm grateful.
p176
aVBut I was at war with myself,
p177
aVand I dug terrible wounds into my own psyche.
p178
aa(lp179
VWe don't seek the painful experiences
p180
aVthat hew our identities,
p181
aVbut we seek our identities
p182
aVin the wake of painful experiences.
p183
aVWe cannot bear a pointless torment,
p184
aVbut we can endure great pain
p185
aVif we believe that it's purposeful.
p186
aVEase makes less of an impression on us
p187
aVthan struggle.
p188
aVWe could have been ourselves without our delights,
p189
aVbut not without the misfortunes that drive our search for meaning.
p190
aV"Therefore, I take pleasure in infirmities,"
p191
aVSt. Paul wrote in Second Corinthians,
p192
aV"for when I am weak, then I am strong."
p193
aa(lp194
VIn 1988, I went to Moscow to interview artists
p195
aVof the Soviet underground.
p196
aVI expected their work to be dissident and political.
p197
aVBut the radicalism in their work
p198
aVactually lay in reinserting humanity into a society
p199
aVthat was annihilating humanity itself,
p200
aVas, in some senses, Russian society is now doing again.
p201
aVOne of the artists I met said to me,
p202
aV"We were in training to be not artists but angels."
p203
aa(lp204
VIn 1991, I went back to see the artists I'd been writing about,
p205
aVand I was with them during the putsch that ended the Soviet Union.
p206
aVAnd they were among the chief organizers of the resistance to that putsch.
p207
aVAnd on the third day of the putsch,
p208
aVone of them suggested we walk up to Smolenskaya.
p209
aVAnd we went there,
p210
aVand we arranged ourselves in front of one of the barricades,
p211
aVand a little while later,
p212
aVa column of tanks rolled up.
p213
aVAnd the soldier on the front tank said,
p214
aV"We have unconditional orders to destroy this barricade.
p215
aVIf you get out of the way, we don't need to hurt you.
p216
aVBut if you won't move, we'll have no choice but to run you down."
p217
aVThe artist I was with said, "Give us just a minute.
p218
aVGive us just a minute to tell you why we're here."
p219
aVAnd the soldier folded his arms,
p220
aVand the artist launched into a Jeffersonian panegyric to democracy
p221
aVsuch as those of us who live in a Jeffersonian democracy
p222
aVwould be hard-pressed to present.
p223
aVAnd they went on and on,
p224
aVand the soldier watched.
p225
aVAnd then he sat there for a full minute after they were finished
p226
aVand looked at us, so bedraggled in the rain,
p227
aVand said, "What you have said is true,
p228
aVand we must bow to the will of the people.
p229
aVIf you'll clear enough space for us to turn around,
p230
aVwe'll go back the way we came."
p231
aVAnd that's what they did.
p232
aVSometimes, forging meaning can give you the vocabulary you need
p233
aVto fight for your ultimate freedom.
p234
aa(lp235
VRussia awakened me to the lemonade notion
p236
aVthat oppression breeds the power to oppose it.
p237
aVAnd I gradually understood that as the cornerstone of identity.
p238
aVIt took identity to rescue me from sadness.
p239
aVThe gay rights movement posits a world
p240
aVin which my aberrances are a victory.
p241
aVIdentity politics always works on two fronts:
p242
aVto give pride to people who have a given condition or characteristic,
p243
aVand to cause the outside world to treat such people
p244
aVmore gently and more kindly.
p245
aVThose are two totally separate enterprises,
p246
aVbut progress in each sphere reverberates in the other.
p247
aVIdentity politics can be narcissistic.
p248
aVPeople extol a difference only because it's theirs.
p249
aVPeople narrow the world and function in discrete groups
p250
aVwithout empathy for one another.
p251
aVBut properly understood and wisely practiced,
p252
aVidentity politics should expand our idea of what it is to be human.
p253
aVIdentity itself should be not a smug label or a gold medal,
p254
aVbut a revolution.
p255
aa(lp256
VI would have had an easier life if I were straight,
p257
aVbut I would not be me.
p258
aVAnd I now like being myself better
p259
aVthan the idea of being someone else,
p260
aVsomeone who, to be honest,
p261
aVI have neither the option of being nor the ability fully to imagine.
p262
aVBut if you banish the dragons, you banish the heroes,
p263
aVand we become attached to the heroic strain in our own lives.
p264
aVI've sometimes wondered
p265
aVwhether I could have ceased to hate that part of myself
p266
aVwithout gay pride's technicolor fiesta,
p267
aVof which this speech is one manifestation.
p268
aa(lp269
V(Laughter)
p270
aa(lp271
VI used to think I would know myself to be mature
p272
aVwhen I could simply be gay without emphasis.
p273
aVBut the self-loathing of that period left a void,
p274
aVand celebration needs to fill and overflow it,
p275
aVand even if I repay my private debt of melancholy,
p276
aVthere's still an outer world of homophobia
p277
aVthat it will take decades to address.
p278
aVSomeday, being gay will be a simple fact,
p279
aVfree of party hats and blame.
p280
aVBut not yet.
p281
aVA friend of mine who thought gay pride was getting very carried away with itself,
p282
aVonce suggested that we organize Gay Humility Week.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Laughter)
p285
aa(lp286
V(Applause)
p287
aa(lp288
VIt's a great idea.
p289
aa(lp290
V(Laughter)
p291
aa(lp292
VBut its time has not yet come.
p293
aa(lp294
V(Laughter)
p295
aa(lp296
VAnd neutrality, which seems to lie halfway between despair and celebration,
p297
aVis actually the endgame.
p298
aa(lp299
VIn 29 states in the US,
p300
aVI could legally be fired or denied housing
p301
aVfor being gay.
p302
aVIn Russia, the anti-propaganda law
p303
aVhas led to people being beaten in the streets.
p304
aVTwenty-seven African countries have passed laws against sodomy.
p305
aVAnd in Nigeria, gay people can legally be stoned to death,
p306
aVand lynchings have become common.
p307
aVIn Saudi Arabia recently,
p308
aVtwo men who had been caught in carnal acts
p309
aVwere sentenced to 7,000 lashes each,
p310
aVand are now permanently disabled as a result.
p311
aVSo who can forge meaning
p312
aVand build identity?
p313
aVGay rights are not primarily marriage rights,
p314
aVand for the millions who live in unaccepting places
p315
aVwith no resources,
p316
aVdignity remains elusive.
p317
aVI am lucky to have forged meaning
p318
aVand built identity,
p319
aVbut that's still a rare privilege.
p320
aVAnd gay people deserve more, collectively,
p321
aVthan the crumbs of justice.
p322
aa(lp323
VAnd yet,
p324
aVevery step forward is so sweet.
p325
aVIn 2007, six years after we met,
p326
aVmy partner and I decided to get married.
p327
aVMeeting John had been the discovery of great happiness
p328
aVand also the elimination of great unhappiness.
p329
aVAnd sometimes, I was so occupied with the disappearance of all that pain,
p330
aVthat I forgot about the joy,
p331
aVwhich was at first the less remarkable part of it to me.
p332
aVMarrying was a way to declare our love
p333
aVas more a presence than an absence.
p334
aa(lp335
VMarriage soon led us to children,
p336
aVand that meant new meanings
p337
aVand new identities \u2014 ours and theirs.
p338
aVI want my children to be happy,
p339
aVand I love them most achingly when they are sad.
p340
aVAs a gay father, I can teach them to own what is wrong in their lives,
p341
aVbut I believe that if I succeed in sheltering them from adversity,
p342
aVI will have failed as a parent.
p343
aVA Buddhist scholar I know once explained to me
p344
aVthat Westerners mistakenly think
p345
aVthat nirvana is what arrives when all your woe is behind you,
p346
aVand you have only bliss to look forward to.
p347
aVBut he said that would not be nirvana,
p348
aVbecause your bliss in the present
p349
aVwould always be shadowed by the joy from the past.
p350
aVNirvana, he said, is what you arrive at
p351
aVwhen you have only bliss to look forward to
p352
aVand find in what looked like sorrows the seedlings of your joy.
p353
aVAnd I sometimes wonder
p354
aVwhether I could have found such fulfillment in marriage and children
p355
aVif they'd come more readily,
p356
aVif I'd been straight in my youth or were young now,
p357
aVin either of which cases this might be easier.
p358
aVPerhaps I could.
p359
aVPerhaps all the complex imagining I've done
p360
aVcould have been applied to other topics.
p361
aVBut if seeking meaning matters more than finding meaning,
p362
aVthe question is not whether I'd be happier for having been bullied,
p363
aVbut whether assigning meaning to those experiences
p364
aVhas made me a better father.
p365
aVI tend to find the ecstasy hidden in ordinary joys,
p366
aVbecause I did not expect those joys to be ordinary to me.
p367
aa(lp368
VI know many heterosexuals who have equally happy marriages and families,
p369
aVbut gay marriage is so breathtakingly fresh,
p370
aVand gay families so exhilaratingly new,
p371
aVand I found meaning in that surprise.
p372
aa(lp373
VIn October, it was my 50th birthday,
p374
aVand my family organized a party for me.
p375
aVAnd in the middle of it, my son said to my husband
p376
aVthat he wanted to make a speech.
p377
aVAnd John said,
p378
aV"George, you can't make a speech. You're four."
p379
aa(lp380
V(Laughter)
p381
aa(lp382
V"Only Grandpa and Uncle David and I are going to make speeches tonight."
p383
aVBut George insisted and insisted,
p384
aVand finally, John took him up to the microphone,
p385
aVand George said very loudly,
p386
aV"Ladies and gentlemen!
p387
aVMay I have your attention, please?"
p388
aVAnd everyone turned around, startled.
p389
aVAnd George said,
p390
aV"I'm glad it's daddy's birthday.
p391
aVI'm glad we all get cake.
p392
aVAnd Daddy, if you were little,
p393
aVI'd be your friend."
p394
aa(lp395
V(Gasp)
p396
aa(lp397
VAnd I thought \u2014 (Applause)
p398
aVThank you.
p399
aVI thought that I was indebted even to Bobby Finkel,
p400
aVbecause all those earlier experiences
p401
aVwere what had propelled me to this moment,
p402
aVand I was finally unconditionally grateful
p403
aVfor a life I'd once have done anything to change.
p404
aa(lp405
VThe gay activist Harvey Milk was once asked by a younger gay man
p406
aVwhat he could do to help the movement,
p407
aVand Harvey Milk said,
p408
aV"Go out and tell someone."
p409
aVThere's always somebody who wants to confiscate our humanity.
p410
aVAnd there are always stories that restore it.
p411
aVIf we live out loud,
p412
aVwe can trounce the hatred,
p413
aVand expand everyone's lives.
p414
aa(lp415
VForge meaning.
p416
aVBuild identity.
p417
aVForge meaning.
p418
aVBuild identity.
p419
aVAnd then invite the world to share your joy.
p420
aa(lp421
VThank you.
p422
aa(lp423
V(Applause)
p424
aa(lp425
VThank you.
p426
aa(lp427
V(Applause)
p428
aa(lp429
VThank you.

p432
aa(lp433

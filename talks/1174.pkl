VBy birth and by choice,
p5
aVI've been involved with the auto industry my entire life,
p6
aVand for the past 30 years,
p7
aVI've worked at Ford Motor Company.
p8
aVAnd for most of those years,
p9
aVI worried about,
p10
aVhow am I going to sell more cars and trucks?
p11
aVBut today I worry about,
p12
aVwhat if all we do is sell more cars and trucks?
p13
aVWhat happens
p14
aVwhen the number of vehicles on the road doubles, triples,
p15
aVor even quadruples?
p16
aa(lp17
VMy life is guided by two great passions,
p18
aVand the first is automobiles.
p19
aVI literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company.
p20
aVI thought it was so cool as a little boy
p21
aVwhen my dad would bring home the latest Ford or Lincoln
p22
aVand leave it in the driveway.
p23
aVAnd I decided about that time, about age 10,
p24
aVthat it would be really cool if I was a test driver.
p25
aVSo my parents would go to dinner.
p26
aVThey'd sit down; I'd sneak out of the house.
p27
aVI'd jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway,
p28
aVand it was a blast.
p29
aVAnd that went on for about two years,
p30
aVuntil \u2014 I think I was about 12 \u2014
p31
aVmy dad brought home
p32
aVa Lincoln Mark III.
p33
aVAnd it was snowing that day.
p34
aVSo he and mom went to dinner,
p35
aVand I snuck out
p36
aVand thought it'd be really cool to do donuts
p37
aVor even some figure-eights in the snow.
p38
aVMy dad finished dinner early that evening.
p39
aVAnd he was walking to the front hall
p40
aVand out the front door
p41
aVjust about the same time I hit some ice
p42
aVand met him at the front door with the car \u2014
p43
aVand almost ended up in the front hall.
p44
aVSo it kind of cooled my test-driving for a little while.
p45
aVBut I really began to love cars then.
p46
aVAnd my first car was a 1975 electric-green Mustang.
p47
aVAnd even though the color was pretty hideous,
p48
aVI did love the car,
p49
aVand it really cemented my love affair with cars
p50
aVthat's continued on to this day.
p51
aa(lp52
VBut cars are really more than a passion of mine;
p53
aVthey're quite literally in my blood.
p54
aVMy great grandfather was Henry Ford,
p55
aVand on my mother's side,
p56
aVmy great grandfather was Harvey Firestone.
p57
aVSo when I was born,
p58
aVI guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me.
p59
aVBut my great grandfather, Henry Ford,
p60
aVreally believed that the mission of the Ford Motor Company
p61
aVwas to make people's lives better
p62
aVand make cars affordable so that everyone could have them.
p63
aVBecause he believed that with mobility
p64
aVcomes freedom and progress.
p65
aVAnd that's a belief that I share.
p66
aa(lp67
VMy other great passion is the environment.
p68
aVAnd as a young boy, I used to go up to Northern Michigan
p69
aVand fish in the rivers that Hemingway fished in
p70
aVand then later wrote about.
p71
aVAnd it really struck me
p72
aVas the years went by,
p73
aVin a very negative way,
p74
aVwhen I would go to some stream that I'd loved,
p75
aVand was used to walking through this field
p76
aVthat was once filled with fireflies,
p77
aVand now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it.
p78
aVAnd so even at a young age,
p79
aVthat really resonated with me,
p80
aVand the whole notion of environmental preservation,
p81
aVat a very basic level, sunk in with me.
p82
aa(lp83
VAs a high-schooler, I started to read
p84
aVauthors like Thoreau and Aldo Leopold
p85
aVand Edward Abbey,
p86
aVand I really began to develop
p87
aVa deeper appreciation of the natural world.
p88
aVBut it never really occurred to me
p89
aVthat my love of cars and trucks
p90
aVwould ever be in conflict with nature.
p91
aVAnd that was true
p92
aVuntil I got to college.
p93
aVAnd when I got to college, you can imagine my surprise
p94
aVwhen I would go to class
p95
aVand a number of my professors would say
p96
aVthat Ford Motor Company and my family
p97
aVwas everything that was wrong with our country.
p98
aVThey thought that we were more interested, as an industry,
p99
aVin profits, rather than progress,
p100
aVand that we filled the skies with smog \u2014
p101
aVand frankly, we were the enemy.
p102
aa(lp103
VI joined Ford after college,
p104
aVafter some soul searching
p105
aVwhether or not this is really the right thing to do.
p106
aVBut I decided that I wanted to go
p107
aVand see if I could affect change there.
p108
aVAnd as I look back over 30 years ago,
p109
aVit was a little naive to think at that age
p110
aVthat I could. But I wanted to.
p111
aVAnd I really discovered
p112
aVthat my professors weren't completely wrong.
p113
aVIn fact, when I got back to Detroit,
p114
aVmy environmental leanings weren't exactly embraced
p115
aVby those in my own company,
p116
aVand certainly by those in the industry.
p117
aVI had some very interesting conversations,
p118
aVas you can imagine.
p119
aVThere were some within Ford
p120
aVwho believed that all this ecological nonsense
p121
aVshould just disappear
p122
aVand that I needed to stop hanging out
p123
aVwith "environmental wackos."
p124
aVI was considered a radical.
p125
aVAnd I'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management
p126
aVand told to stop associating
p127
aVwith any known or suspected environmentalists.
p128
aV(Laughter)
p129
aVOf course, I had no intention of doing that,
p130
aVand I kept speaking out about the environment,
p131
aVand it really was the topic
p132
aVthat we now today call sustainability.
p133
aVAnd in time, my views went from controversial
p134
aVto more or less consensus today.
p135
aVI mean, I think most people in the industry
p136
aVunderstand that we've got to get on with it.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd the good news is today we are tackling the big issues,
p139
aVof cars and the environment \u2014
p140
aVnot only at Ford, but really as an industry.
p141
aVWe're pushing fuel efficiency to new heights.
p142
aVAnd with new technology,
p143
aVwe're reducing \u2014 and I believe, someday we'll eliminate \u2014
p144
aVCO2 emissions.
p145
aVWe're starting to sell electric cars, which is great.
p146
aVWe're developing alternative powertrains
p147
aVthat are going to make cars affordable
p148
aVin every sense of the word \u2014
p149
aVeconomically, socially
p150
aVand environmentally.
p151
aVAnd actually, although we've got a long way to go
p152
aVand a lot of work to do,
p153
aVI can see the day where my two great passions \u2014
p154
aVcars and the environment \u2014
p155
aVactually come into harmony.
p156
aa(lp157
VBut unfortunately,
p158
aVas we're on our way to solving one monstrous problem \u2014
p159
aVand as I said, we're not there yet; we've got a lot of work to do,
p160
aVbut I can see where we will \u2014
p161
aVbut even as we're in the process of doing that,
p162
aVanother huge problem is looming,
p163
aVand people aren't noticing.
p164
aVAnd that is the freedom of mobility
p165
aVthat my great grandfather brought to people
p166
aVis now being threatened, just as the environment is.
p167
aVThe problem, put in its simplest terms,
p168
aVis one of mathematics.
p169
aVToday there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world,
p170
aVand within our lifetime, that number's going to grow
p171
aVto about nine billion.
p172
aVAnd at that population level,
p173
aVour planet will be dealing with the limits of growth.
p174
aVAnd with that growth
p175
aVcomes some severe practical problems,
p176
aVone of which is our transportation system
p177
aVsimply won't be able to deal with it.
p178
aa(lp179
VWhen we look at the population growth in terms of cars,
p180
aVit becomes even clearer.
p181
aVToday there are about 800 million cars on the road worldwide.
p182
aVBut with more people
p183
aVand greater prosperity around the world,
p184
aVthat number's going to grow
p185
aVto between two and four billion cars by mid century.
p186
aVAnd this is going to create the kind of global gridlock
p187
aVthat the world has never seen before.
p188
aVNow think about the impact
p189
aVthat this is going to have on our daily lives.
p190
aVToday the average American
p191
aVspends about a week a year
p192
aVstuck in traffic jams,
p193
aVand that's a huge waste of time and resources.
p194
aVBut that's nothing compared
p195
aVto what's going on
p196
aVin the nations that are growing the fastest.
p197
aVToday the average driver in Beijing
p198
aVhas a five-hour commute.
p199
aVAnd last summer \u2014 many of you probably saw this \u2014
p200
aVthere was a hundred-mile traffic jam
p201
aVthat took 11 days to clear in China.
p202
aVIn the decades to come,
p203
aV75 percent of the world's population
p204
aVwill live in cities,
p205
aVand 50 of those cities
p206
aVwill be of 10 million people or more.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo you can see the size of the issue that we're facing.
p209
aVWhen you factor in population growth,
p210
aVit's clear that the mobility model that we have today
p211
aVsimply will not work tomorrow.
p212
aVFrankly, four billion clean cars on the road
p213
aVare still four billion cars,
p214
aVand a traffic jam with no emissions
p215
aVis still a traffic jam.
p216
aVSo, if we make no changes today,
p217
aVwhat does tomorrow look like?
p218
aVWell I think you probably already have the picture.
p219
aVTraffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge,
p220
aVand they're really very, very inconvenient,
p221
aVbut that's all they are.
p222
aVBut the bigger issue
p223
aVis that global gridlock
p224
aVis going to stifle economic growth
p225
aVand our ability to deliver
p226
aVfood and health care,
p227
aVparticularly to people that live in city centers.
p228
aVAnd our quality of life is going to be severely compromised.
p229
aVSo what's going to solve this?
p230
aa(lp231
VWell the answer isn't going to be more of the same.
p232
aVMy great grandfather once said
p233
aVbefore he invented the Model T,
p234
aV"If I had asked people then what they wanted,
p235
aVthey would have answered,
p236
aV'We want faster horses.'"
p237
aVSo the answer to more cars
p238
aVis simply not to have more roads.
p239
aVWhen America began moving west,
p240
aVwe didn't add more wagon trains,
p241
aVwe built railroads.
p242
aVAnd to connect our country after World War II,
p243
aVwe didn't build more two-lane highways,
p244
aVwe built the interstate highway system.
p245
aVToday we need that same leap in thinking
p246
aVfor us to create a viable future.
p247
aVWe are going to build smart cars,
p248
aVbut we also need to build
p249
aVsmart roads, smart parking,
p250
aVsmart public transportation systems and more.
p251
aVWe don't want to waste our time
p252
aVsitting in traffic, sitting at tollbooths
p253
aVor looking for parking spots.
p254
aVWe need an integrated system
p255
aVthat uses real time data
p256
aVto optimize personal mobility on a massive scale
p257
aVwithout hassle or compromises for travelers.
p258
aVAnd frankly, that's the kind of system
p259
aVthat's going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable.
p260
aa(lp261
VNow the good news is some of this work has already begun
p262
aVin different parts of the world.
p263
aVThe city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi
p264
aVuses driverless electric vehicles
p265
aVthat can communicate with one another,
p266
aVand they go underneath the city streets.
p267
aVAnd up above, you've got a series of pedestrian walkways.
p268
aVOn New York City's 34th Street,
p269
aVgridlock will soon be replaced
p270
aVwith a connected system
p271
aVof vehicle-specific corridors.
p272
aVPedestrian zones and dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created,
p273
aVand all of this will cut down the average rush hour commute
p274
aVto get across town in New York
p275
aVfrom about an hour today at rush hour
p276
aVto about 20 minutes.
p277
aVNow if you look at Hong Kong,
p278
aVthey have a very interesting system called Octopus there.
p279
aVIt's a system that really ties together
p280
aVall the transportation assets
p281
aVinto a single payment system.
p282
aVSo parking garages, buses, trains,
p283
aVthey all operate within the same system.
p284
aVNow shared car services
p285
aVare also springing up around the world,
p286
aVand these efforts, I think, are great.
p287
aVThey're relieving congestion,
p288
aVand they're frankly starting to save some fuel.
p289
aa(lp290
VThese are all really good ideas
p291
aVthat will move us forward.
p292
aVBut what really inspires me
p293
aVis what's going to be possible
p294
aVwhen our cars can begin talking to each other.
p295
aVVery soon, the same systems that we use today
p296
aVto bring music and entertainment
p297
aVand GPS information into our vehicles
p298
aVare going to be used to create
p299
aVa smart vehicle network.
p300
aVEvery morning I drive about 30 miles
p301
aVfrom my home in Ann Arbor to my office in Dearborn, Michigan.
p302
aVAnd every night I go home,
p303
aVmy commute is a total crapshoot.
p304
aVAnd I often have to leave the freeway
p305
aVand look for different ways
p306
aVfor me to try and make it home.
p307
aVBut very soon we're going to see the days
p308
aVwhen cars are essentially talking to each other.
p309
aVSo if the car ahead of me on I-94 hits traffic,
p310
aVit will immediately alert my car
p311
aVand tell my car to reroute itself
p312
aVto get me home in the best possible way.
p313
aVAnd these systems are being tested right now,
p314
aVand frankly they're going to be ready for prime time pretty soon.
p315
aa(lp316
VBut the potential of a connected car network
p317
aVis almost limitless.
p318
aVSo just imagine:
p319
aVone day very soon,
p320
aVyou're going to be able to plan a trip downtown
p321
aVand your car will be connected to a smart parking system.
p322
aVSo you get in your car,
p323
aVand as you get in your car,
p324
aVyour car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive \u2014
p325
aVno more driving around looking for one,
p326
aVwhich frankly is one of the biggest users of fuel
p327
aVin today's cars in urban areas \u2014
p328
aVis looking for parking spots.
p329
aVOr think about being in New York City
p330
aVand tracking down an intelligent cab on your smart phone
p331
aVso you don't have to wait in the cold to hail one.
p332
aVOr being at a future TED Conference
p333
aVand having your car
p334
aVtalk to the calendars of everybody here
p335
aVand telling you all the best route to take home
p336
aVand when you should leave
p337
aVso that you can all arrive at your next destination on time.
p338
aVThis is the kind of technology
p339
aVthat will merge millions of individual vehicles
p340
aVinto a single system.
p341
aa(lp342
VSo I think it's clear we have the beginnings of a solution
p343
aVto this enormous problem.
p344
aVBut as we found out with addressing CO2 issues,
p345
aVand also fossil fuels,
p346
aVthere is no one silver bullet.
p347
aVThe solution is not going to be
p348
aVmore cars, more roads or a new rail system;
p349
aVit can only be found, I believe,
p350
aVin a global network
p351
aVof interconnected solutions.
p352
aVNow I know we can develop the technology
p353
aVthat's going to make this work,
p354
aVbut we've got to be willing to get out there
p355
aVand seek out the solutions \u2014
p356
aVwhether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation
p357
aVor some other way we haven't even thought of yet;
p358
aVour overall transportation-mix and infrastructure
p359
aVmust support all the future options.
p360
aa(lp361
VWe need our best and our brightest
p362
aVto start entertaining this issue.
p363
aVCompanies, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists,
p364
aVthey all need to understand
p365
aVthis is a huge business opportunity,
p366
aVas well as an enormous social problem.
p367
aVAnd just as these groups
p368
aVembrace the green energy challenge \u2014
p369
aVand it's really been amazing to me to watch
p370
aVhow much brain power, how much money
p371
aVand how much serious thought
p372
aVhas, really over the last three years,
p373
aVjust poured into the green energy field.
p374
aVWe need that same kind of passion and energy
p375
aVto attack global gridlock.
p376
aVBut we need people like all of you in this room,
p377
aVleading thinkers.
p378
aVI mean, frankly, I need all of you
p379
aVto think about how
p380
aVyou can help solve this huge issue.
p381
aVAnd we need people from all walks of life;
p382
aVnot just inventors, we need policymakers
p383
aVand government officials
p384
aVto also think about how they're going to respond to this challenge.
p385
aa(lp386
VThis isn't going to be solved
p387
aVby any one person or one group.
p388
aVIt's going to really require a national energy policy,
p389
aVfrankly for each country,
p390
aVbecause the solutions in each country are going to be different
p391
aVbased upon income levels, traffic jams
p392
aVand also how integrated
p393
aVthe systems already are.
p394
aVBut we need to get going, and we need to get going today.
p395
aVAnd we must have an infrastructure
p396
aVthat's designed to support
p397
aVthis flexible future.
p398
aa(lp399
VYou know, we've come a long way.
p400
aVSince the Model T,
p401
aVmost people never traveled
p402
aVmore than 25 miles from home in their entire lifetime.
p403
aVAnd since then,
p404
aVthe automobile has allowed us the freedom
p405
aVto choose where we live, where we work,
p406
aVwhere we play
p407
aVand frankly when we just go out and want to move around.
p408
aVWe don't want to regress and lose that freedom.
p409
aVWe're on our way to solving \u2014
p410
aVand as I said earlier, I know we've got a long way to go \u2014
p411
aVthe one big issue that we're all focused on that threatens it,
p412
aVand that's the environmental issue,
p413
aVbut I believe we all must turn
p414
aVall of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination
p415
aVto help now solve this notion of global gridlock.
p416
aVBecause in doing so,
p417
aVwe're going to preserve what we've really come to take for granted,
p418
aVwhich is the freedom to move
p419
aVand move very effortlessly around the world.
p420
aVAnd it frankly will enhance our quality of life
p421
aVif we fix this.
p422
aVBecause, if you can envision, as I do,
p423
aVa future of zero emissions
p424
aVand freedom to move around the country and around the world
p425
aVlike we take for granted today,
p426
aVthat's worth the hard work today
p427
aVto preserve that for tomorrow.
p428
aa(lp429
VI believe we're at our best
p430
aVwhen we're confronted with big issues.
p431
aVThis is a big one, and it won't wait.
p432
aVSo let's get started now.
p433
aa(lp434
VThank you.

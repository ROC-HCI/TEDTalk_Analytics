VI published this article
p5
aVin the New York Times Modern Love column in January of this year.
p6
aV"To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This."
p7
aVAnd the article is about a psychological study
p8
aVdesigned to create romantic love in the laboratory,
p9
aVand my own experience trying the study myself
p10
aVone night last summer.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo the procedure is fairly simple:
p13
aVtwo strangers take turns asking each other 36 increasingly personal questions
p14
aVand then they stare into each other's eyes
p15
aVwithout speaking for four minutes.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo here are a couple of sample questions.
p18
aa(lp19
VNumber 12: If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability,
p20
aVwhat would it be?
p21
aa(lp22
VNumber 28: When did you last cry in front of another person?
p23
aVBy yourself?
p24
aa(lp25
VAs you can see, they really do get more personal as they go along.
p26
aa(lp27
VNumber 30, I really like this one:
p28
aVTell your partner what you like about them;
p29
aVbe very honest this time,
p30
aVsaying things you might not say to someone you just met.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo when I first came across this study a few years earlier,
p33
aVone detail really stuck out to me,
p34
aVand that was the rumor that two of the participants
p35
aVhad gotten married six months later,
p36
aVand they'd invited the entire lab to the ceremony.
p37
aVSo I was of course very skeptical
p38
aVabout this process of just manufacturing romantic love,
p39
aVbut of course I was intrigued.
p40
aVAnd when I got the chance to try this study myself,
p41
aVwith someone I knew but not particularly well,
p42
aVI wasn't expecting to fall in love.
p43
aVBut then we did, and \u2014
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd I thought it made a good story, so I sent it to the Modern Love column
p48
aVa few months later.
p49
aa(lp50
VNow, this was published in January,
p51
aVand now it is August,
p52
aVso I'm guessing that some of you are probably wondering,
p53
aVare we still together?
p54
aVAnd the reason I think you might be wondering this
p55
aVis because I have been asked this question
p56
aVagain and again and again for the past seven months.
p57
aVAnd this question is really what I want to talk about today.
p58
aVBut let's come back to it.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VSo the week before the article came out,
p63
aVI was very nervous.
p64
aVI had been working on a book about love stories
p65
aVfor the past few years,
p66
aVso I had gotten used to writing about my own experiences
p67
aVwith romantic love on my blog.
p68
aVBut a blog post might get a couple hundred views at the most,
p69
aVand those were usually just my Facebook friends,
p70
aVand I figured my article in the New York Times
p71
aVwould probably get a few thousand views.
p72
aVAnd that felt like a lot of attention
p73
aVon a relatively new relationship.
p74
aVBut as it turned out, I had no idea.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo the article was published online
p77
aVon a Friday evening,
p78
aVand by Saturday, this had happened to the traffic on my blog.
p79
aVAnd by Sunday, both the Today Show and Good Morning America had called.
p80
aVWithin a month, the article would receive over 8 million views,
p81
aVand I was, to say the least,
p82
aVunderprepared for this sort of attention.
p83
aVIt's one thing to work up the confidence to write honestly
p84
aVabout your experiences with love,
p85
aVbut it is another thing to discover
p86
aVthat your love life has made international news \u2014
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
Vand to realize that people across the world
p91
aVare genuinely invested in the status of your new relationship.
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd when people called or emailed, which they did every day for weeks,
p96
aVthey always asked the same question first:
p97
aVare you guys still together?
p98
aVIn fact, as I was preparing this talk,
p99
aVI did a quick search of my email inbox
p100
aVfor the phrase "Are you still together?"
p101
aVand several messages popped up immediately.
p102
aVThey were from students and journalists
p103
aVand friendly strangers like this one.
p104
aVI did radio interviews and they asked.
p105
aVI even gave a talk, and one woman shouted up to the stage,
p106
aV"Hey Mandy, where's your boyfriend?"
p107
aVAnd I promptly turned bright red.
p108
aa(lp109
VI understand that this is part of the deal.
p110
aVIf you write about your relationship in an international newspaper,
p111
aVyou should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
p112
aVBut I just wasn't prepared for the scope of the response.
p113
aVThe 36 questions seem to have taken on a life of their own.
p114
aVIn fact, the New York Times published a follow-up article
p115
aVfor Valentine's Day,
p116
aVwhich featured readers' experiences of trying the study themselves,
p117
aVwith varying degrees of success.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo my first impulse in the face of all of this attention
p120
aVwas to become very protective of my own relationship.
p121
aVI said no to every request for the two of us
p122
aVto do a media appearance together.
p123
aVI turned down TV interviews,
p124
aVand I said no to every request for photos of the two us.
p125
aVI think I was afraid that we would become
p126
aVinadvertent icons for the process of falling in love,
p127
aVa position I did not at all feel qualified for.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd I get it:
p130
aVpeople didn't just want to know if the study worked,
p131
aVthey wanted to know if it really worked:
p132
aVthat is, if it was capable of producing love that would last,
p133
aVnot just a fling, but real love, sustainable love.
p134
aa(lp135
VBut this was a question I didn't feel capable of answering.
p136
aVMy own relationship was only a few months old,
p137
aVand I felt like people were asking the wrong question in the first place.
p138
aVWhat would knowing whether or not we were still together really tell them?
p139
aVIf the answer was no,
p140
aVwould it make the experience of doing these 36 questions
p141
aVany less worthwhile?
p142
aVDr. Arthur Aron first wrote about these questions
p143
aVin this study here in 1997,
p144
aVand here, the researcher's goal was not to produce romantic love.
p145
aVInstead, they wanted to foster
p146
aVinterpersonal closeness among college students,
p147
aVby using what Aron called
p148
aV"sustained, escalating, reciprocal, personalistic self-disclosure."
p149
aVSounds romantic, doesn't it?
p150
aVBut the study did work.
p151
aVThe participants did feel closer after doing it,
p152
aVand several subsequent studies have also used Aron's fast friends protocol
p153
aVas a way to quickly create trust and intimacy between strangers.
p154
aVThey've used it between members of the police and members of community,
p155
aVand they've used it between people of opposing political ideologies.
p156
aVThe original version of the story,
p157
aVthe one that I tried last summer,
p158
aVthat pairs the personal questions with four minutes of eye contact,
p159
aVwas referenced in this article,
p160
aVbut unfortunately it was never published.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo a few months ago, I was giving a talk
p163
aVat a small liberal arts college,
p164
aVand a student came up to me afterwards
p165
aVand he said, kind of shyly,
p166
aV"So, I tried your study, and it didn't work."
p167
aVHe seemed a little mystified by this.
p168
aV"You mean, you didn't fall in love with the person you did it with?" I asked.
p169
aa(lp170
V"Well..." He paused.
p171
aV"I think she just wants to be friends."
p172
aa(lp173
V"But did you become better friends?" I asked.
p174
aV"Did you feel like you got to really know each other after doing the study?"
p175
aVHe nodded.
p176
aa(lp177
V"So, then it worked," I said.
p178
aa(lp179
VI don't think this is the answer he was looking for.
p180
aVIn fact, I don't think this is the answer that any of us are looking for
p181
aVwhen it comes to love.
p182
aa(lp183
VI first came across this study
p184
aVwhen I was 29
p185
aVand I was going through a really difficult breakup.
p186
aVI had been in the relationship since I was 20,
p187
aVwhich was basically my entire adult life,
p188
aVand he was my first real love,
p189
aVand I had no idea how or if I could make a life without him.
p190
aVSo I turned to science.
p191
aVI researched everything I could find about the science of romantic love,
p192
aVand I think I was hoping that it might somehow inoculate me from heartache.
p193
aVI don't know if I realized this at the time \u2014
p194
aVI thought I was just doing research for this book I was writing \u2014
p195
aVbut it seems really obvious in retrospect.
p196
aVI hoped that if I armed myself with the knowledge of romantic love,
p197
aVI might never have to feel as terrible and lonely as I did then.
p198
aVAnd all this knowledge has been useful in some ways.
p199
aVI am more patient with love. I am more relaxed.
p200
aVI am more confident about asking for what I want.
p201
aVBut I can also see myself more clearly,
p202
aVand I can see that what I want is sometimes more
p203
aVthan can reasonably be asked for.
p204
aVWhat I want from love is a guarantee,
p205
aVnot just that I am loved today
p206
aVand that I will be loved tomorrow,
p207
aVbut that I will continue to be loved by the person I love indefinitely.
p208
aVMaybe it's this possibility of a guarantee
p209
aVthat people were really asking about
p210
aVwhen they wanted to know if we were still together.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo the story that the media told about the 36 questions
p213
aVwas that there might be a shortcut to falling in love.
p214
aVThere might be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk involved,
p215
aVand this is a very appealing story,
p216
aVbecause falling in love feels amazing,
p217
aVbut it's also terrifying.
p218
aVThe moment you admit to loving someone,
p219
aVyou admit to having a lot to lose,
p220
aVand it's true that these questions do provide a mechanism
p221
aVfor getting to know someone quickly,
p222
aVwhich is also a mechanism for being known,
p223
aVand I think this is the thing that most of us really want from love:
p224
aVto be known, to be seen, to be understood.
p225
aVBut I think when it comes to love,
p226
aVwe are too willing to accept the short version of the story.
p227
aVThe version of the story that asks, "Are you still together?"
p228
aVand is content with a yes or no answer.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo rather than that question,
p231
aVI would propose we ask some more difficult questions,
p232
aVquestions like:
p233
aVHow do you decide who deserves your love
p234
aVand who does not?
p235
aVHow do you stay in love when things get difficult,
p236
aVand how do you know when to just cut and run?
p237
aVHow do you live with the doubt
p238
aVthat inevitably creeps into every relationship,
p239
aVor even harder,
p240
aVhow do you live with your partner's doubt?
p241
aVI don't necessarily know the answers to these questions,
p242
aVbut I think they're an important start at having a more thoughtful conversation
p243
aVabout what it means to love someone.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo, if you want it,
p246
aVthe short version of the story of my relationship is this:
p247
aVa year ago, an acquaintance and I did a study
p248
aVdesigned to create romantic love,
p249
aVand we fell in love,
p250
aVand we are still together,
p251
aVand I am so glad.
p252
aa(lp253
VBut falling in love is not the same thing as staying in love.
p254
aVFalling in love is the easy part.
p255
aVSo at the end of my article, I wrote, "Love didn't happen to us.
p256
aVWe're in love because we each made the choice to be."
p257
aVAnd I cringe a little when I read that now,
p258
aVnot because it isn't true,
p259
aVbut because at the time, I really hadn't considered
p260
aVeverything that was contained in that choice.
p261
aVI didn't consider how many times we would each have to make that choice,
p262
aVand how many times I will continue to have to make that choice
p263
aVwithout knowing whether or not he will always choose me.
p264
aVI want it to be enough to have asked and answered 36 questions,
p265
aVand to have chosen to love someone so generous and kind and fun
p266
aVand to have broadcast that choice in the biggest newspaper in America.
p267
aVBut what I have done instead is turn my relationship
p268
aVinto the kind of myth I don't quite believe in.
p269
aVAnd what I want, what perhaps I will spend my life wanting,
p270
aVis for that myth to be true.
p271
aa(lp272
VI want the happy ending implied by the title to my article,
p273
aVwhich is, incidentally,
p274
aVthe only part of the article that I didn't actually write.
p275
aa(lp276
V(Laughter)
p277
aa(lp278
VBut what I have instead is the chance to make the choice to love someone,
p279
aVand the hope that he will choose to love me back,
p280
aVand it is terrifying,
p281
aVbut that's the deal with love.
p282
aa(lp283
VThank you.

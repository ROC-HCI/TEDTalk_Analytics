VIs E.T. out there?
p5
aVWell, I work at the SETI Institute.
p6
aVThat's almost my name. SETI:
p7
aVSearch for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.
p8
aVIn other words, I look for aliens,
p9
aVand when I tell people that at a cocktail party, they usually
p10
aVlook at me with a mildly incredulous look on their face.
p11
aVI try to keep my own face somewhat dispassionate.
p12
aa(lp13
VNow, a lot of people think that this is kind of idealistic,
p14
aVridiculous, maybe even hopeless,
p15
aVbut I just want to talk to you a little bit about why I think
p16
aVthat the job I have is actually a privilege, okay,
p17
aVand give you a little bit of the motivation for my getting into
p18
aVthis line of work, if that's what you call it.
p19
aVThis thing \u2014 whoops, can we go back?
p20
aVHello, come in, Earth.
p21
aVThere we go. All right.
p22
aa(lp23
VThis is the Owens Valley Radio Observatory
p24
aVbehind the Sierra Nevadas, and in 1968,
p25
aVI was working there collecting data for my thesis.
p26
aVNow, it's kinda lonely, it's kinda tedious, just collecting data,
p27
aVso I would amuse myself by taking photos at night
p28
aVof the telescopes or even of myself,
p29
aVbecause, you know, at night, I would be the only hominid
p30
aVwithin about 30 miles.
p31
aVSo here are pictures of myself.
p32
aVThe observatory had just acquired a new book,
p33
aVwritten by a Russian cosmologist
p34
aVby the name of Joseph Shklovsky, and then expanded
p35
aVand translated and edited by a little-known
p36
aVCornell astronomer by the name of Carl Sagan.
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd I remember reading that book,
p39
aVand at 3 in the morning I was reading this book
p40
aVand it was explaining how the antennas I was using
p41
aVto measure the spins of galaxies could also be used
p42
aVto communicate, to send bits of information
p43
aVfrom one star system to another.
p44
aVNow, at 3 o'clock in the morning when you're all alone,
p45
aVhaven't had much sleep, that was a very romantic idea,
p46
aVbut it was that idea \u2014 the fact that you could in fact
p47
aVprove that there's somebody out there
p48
aVjust using this same technology \u2014
p49
aVthat appealed to me so much that 20 years later I took a job
p50
aVat the SETI Institute. Now, I have to say
p51
aVthat my memory is notoriously porous, and I've often
p52
aVwondered whether there was any truth in this story,
p53
aVor I was just, you know, misremembering something,
p54
aVbut I recently just blew up this old negative of mine,
p55
aVand sure enough, there you can see
p56
aVthe Shklovsky and Sagan book underneath that
p57
aVanalog calculating device.
p58
aVSo it was true.
p59
aa(lp60
VAll right. Now, the idea for doing this, it wasn't very old
p61
aVat the time that I made that photo.
p62
aVThe idea dates from 1960, when a young astronomer
p63
aVby the name of Frank Drake used this antenna
p64
aVin West Virginia, pointed it at a couple of nearby stars
p65
aVin the hopes of eavesdropping on E.T.
p66
aVNow, Frank didn't hear anything.
p67
aVActually he did, but it turned out to be the U.S. Air Force,
p68
aVwhich doesn't count as extraterrestrial intelligence.
p69
aVBut Drake's idea here became very popular
p70
aVbecause it was very appealing \u2014 and I'll get back to that \u2014
p71
aVand on the basis of this experiment, which didn't succeed,
p72
aVwe have been doing SETI ever since,
p73
aVnot continuously, but ever since.
p74
aa(lp75
VWe still haven't heard anything.
p76
aVWe still haven't heard anything.
p77
aVIn fact, we don't know about any life beyond Earth,
p78
aVbut I'm going to suggest to you that that's going to change
p79
aVrather soon, and part of the reason, in fact,
p80
aVthe majority of the reason why I think that's going to change
p81
aVis that the equipment's getting better.
p82
aVThis is the Allen Telescope Array, about 350 miles
p83
aVfrom whatever seat you're in right now.
p84
aVThis is something that we're using today
p85
aVto search for E.T., and the electronics have gotten
p86
aVvery much better too.
p87
aVThis is Frank Drake's electronics in 1960.
p88
aVThis is the Allen Telescope Array electronics today.
p89
aVSome pundit with too much time on his hands
p90
aVhas reckoned that the new experiments are approximately
p91
aV100 trillion times better than they were in 1960,
p92
aV100 trillion times better.
p93
aVThat's a degree of an improvement that would look good
p94
aVon your report card, okay?
p95
aVBut something that's not appreciated by the public is,
p96
aVin fact, that the experiment continues to get better,
p97
aVand, consequently, tends to get faster.
p98
aVThis is a little plot, and every time you show a plot,
p99
aVyou lose 10 percent of the audience.
p100
aVI have 12 of these. (Laughter)
p101
aVBut what I plotted here is just some metric
p102
aVthat shows how fast we're searching.
p103
aVIn other words, we're looking for a needle in a haystack.
p104
aVWe know how big the haystack is. It's the galaxy.
p105
aVBut we're going through the haystack no longer
p106
aVwith a teaspoon but with a skip loader,
p107
aVbecause of this increase in speed.
p108
aVIn fact, those of you who are still conscious
p109
aVand mathematically competent,
p110
aVwill note that this is a semi-log plot.
p111
aVIn other words, the rate of increase is exponential.
p112
aVIt's exponentially improving. Now, exponential is an
p113
aVoverworked word. You hear it on the media all the time.
p114
aVThey don't really know what exponential means,
p115
aVbut this is exponential.
p116
aVIn fact, it's doubling every 18 months, and, of course,
p117
aVevery card-carrying member of the digerati knows
p118
aVthat that's Moore's Law.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo this means that over the course of the next
p121
aVtwo dozen years, we'll be able to look at a million star systems,
p122
aVa million star systems, looking for signals
p123
aVthat would prove somebody's out there.
p124
aVWell, a million star systems, is that interesting?
p125
aVI mean, how many of those star systems have planets?
p126
aVAnd the facts are, we didn't know the answer to that
p127
aVeven as recently as 15 years ago, and in fact, we really
p128
aVdidn't know it even as recently as six months ago.
p129
aVBut now we do. Recent results suggest
p130
aVthat virtually every star has planets, and more than one.
p131
aVThey're like, you know, kittens. You get a litter.
p132
aVYou don't get one kitten. You get a bunch.
p133
aVSo in fact, this is a pretty accurate estimate
p134
aVof the number of planets in our galaxy,
p135
aVjust in our galaxy, by the way,
p136
aVand I remind the non-astronomy majors among you
p137
aVthat our galaxy is only one of 100 billion
p138
aVthat we can see with our telescopes.
p139
aa(lp140
VThat's a lot of real estate, but of course,
p141
aVmost of these planets are going to be kind of worthless,
p142
aVlike, you know, Mercury, or Neptune.
p143
aVNeptune's probably not very big in your life.
p144
aVSo the question is, what fraction of these planets
p145
aVare actually suitable for life?
p146
aVWe don't know the answer to that either,
p147
aVbut we will learn that answer this year, thanks to
p148
aVNASA's Kepler Space Telescope,
p149
aVand in fact, the smart money, which is to say the people who work on this project,
p150
aVthe smart money is suggesting that the fraction of planets
p151
aVthat might be suitable for life is maybe one in a thousand,
p152
aVone in a hundred, something like that.
p153
aVWell, even taking the pessimistic estimate, that it's
p154
aVone in a thousand, that means that there are
p155
aVat least a billion cousins of the Earth
p156
aVjust in our own galaxy.
p157
aVOkay, now I've given you a lot of numbers here,
p158
aVbut they're mostly big numbers, okay, so, you know,
p159
aVkeep that in mind. There's plenty of real estate,
p160
aVplenty of real estate in the universe,
p161
aVand if we're the only bit of real estate in which there's
p162
aVsome interesting occupants, that makes you a miracle,
p163
aVand I know you like to think you're a miracle,
p164
aVbut if you do science, you learn rather quickly that
p165
aVevery time you think you're a miracle, you're wrong,
p166
aVso probably not the case.
p167
aa(lp168
VAll right, so the bottom line is this:
p169
aVBecause of the increase in speed, and because of the
p170
aVvast amount of habitable real estate in the cosmos, I figure
p171
aVwe're going to pick up a signal within two dozen years.
p172
aVAnd I feel strongly enough about that to make a bet with you:
p173
aVEither we're going to find E.T. in the next two dozen years,
p174
aVor I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
p175
aVSo that's not so bad. I mean, even with two dozen years,
p176
aVyou open up your browser and there's news of a signal,
p177
aVor you get a cup of coffee.
p178
aVNow, let me tell you about some aspect of this that
p179
aVpeople don't think about, and that is,
p180
aVwhat happens? Suppose that what I say is true.
p181
aVI mean, who knows, but suppose it happens.
p182
aVSuppose some time in the next two dozen years
p183
aVwe pick up a faint line that tells us
p184
aVwe have some cosmic company.
p185
aVWhat is the effect? What's the consequence?
p186
aVNow, I might be at ground zero for this.
p187
aa(lp188
VI happen to know what the consequence for me would be,
p189
aVbecause we've had false alarms. This is 1997,
p190
aVand this is a photo I made at about 3 o'clock in the morning
p191
aVin Mountain View here, when we were watching
p192
aVthe computer monitors because we had picked up a signal
p193
aVthat we thought, "This is the real deal." All right?
p194
aVAnd I kept waiting for the Men in Black to show up. Right?
p195
aVI kept waiting for \u2014 I kept waiting for my mom to call,
p196
aVsomebody to call, the government to call. Nobody called.
p197
aVNobody called. I was so nervous
p198
aVthat I couldn't sit down. I just wandered around
p199
aVtaking photos like this one, just for something to do.
p200
aVWell, at 9:30 in the morning, with my head down
p201
aVon my desk because I obviously hadn't slept all night,
p202
aVthe phone rings and it's The New York Times.
p203
aVAnd I think there's a lesson in that, and that lesson is
p204
aVthat if we pick up a signal, the media, the media will be on it
p205
aVfaster than a weasel on ball bearings. It's going to be fast.
p206
aVYou can be sure of that. No secrecy.
p207
aVThat's what happens to me. It kind of ruins my whole week,
p208
aVbecause whatever I've got planned that week is kind of out the window.
p209
aa(lp210
VBut what about you? What's it going to do to you?
p211
aVAnd the answer is that we don't know the answer.
p212
aVWe don't know what that's going to do to you,
p213
aVnot in the long term, and not even very much in the short term.
p214
aVI mean, that would be a bit like
p215
aVasking Chris Columbus in 1491, "Hey Chris,
p216
aVyou know, what happens if it turns out that there's a
p217
aVcontinent between here and Japan, where you're sailing to,
p218
aVwhat will be the consequences for humanity
p219
aVif that turns out to be the case?"
p220
aVAnd I think Chris would probably offer you some answer
p221
aVthat you might not have understood, but it probably
p222
aVwouldn't have been right, and I think that to predict
p223
aVwhat finding E.T.'s going to mean,
p224
aVwe can't predict that either.
p225
aVBut here are a couple things I can say.
p226
aVTo begin with, it's going to be a society that's way in advance of our own.
p227
aVYou're not going to hear from alien Neanderthals.
p228
aVThey're not building transmitters.
p229
aVThey're going to be ahead of us, maybe by a few thousand
p230
aVyears, maybe by a few millions years, but substantially
p231
aVahead of us, and that means, if you can understand
p232
aVanything that they're going to say, then you might be able
p233
aVto short-circuit history by getting information from a society
p234
aVthat's way beyond our own.
p235
aVNow, you might find that a bit hyperbolic, and maybe it is,
p236
aVbut nonetheless, it's conceivable that this will happen,
p237
aVand, you know, you could consider this like, I don't know,
p238
aVgiving Julius Caesar English lessons and the key
p239
aVto the library of Congress.
p240
aVIt would change his day, all right?
p241
aa(lp242
VThat's one thing. Another thing that's for sure
p243
aVgoing to happen is that it will calibrate us.
p244
aVWe will know that we're not that miracle, right,
p245
aVthat we're just another duck in a row,
p246
aVwe're not the only kids on the block, and I think that that's
p247
aVphilosophically a very profound thing to learn.
p248
aVWe're not a miracle, okay?
p249
aa(lp250
VThe third thing that it might tell you is somewhat vague,
p251
aVbut I think interesting and important,
p252
aVand that is, if you find a signal coming from a more
p253
aVadvanced society, because they will be,
p254
aVthat will tell you something about our own possibilities,
p255
aVthat we're not inevitably doomed to self-destruction.
p256
aVBecause they survived their technology,
p257
aVwe could do it too.
p258
aVNormally when you look out into the universe,
p259
aVyou're looking back in time. All right?
p260
aVThat's interesting to cosmologists.
p261
aVBut in this sense, you actually can look into the future,
p262
aVhazily, but you can look into the future.
p263
aVSo those are all the sorts of things that would come from a detection.
p264
aa(lp265
VNow, let me talk a little bit about something that happens
p266
aVeven in the meantime, and that is,
p267
aVSETI, I think, is important, because it's exploration, and
p268
aVit's not only exploration, it's comprehensible exploration.
p269
aVNow, I gotta tell you, I'm always reading books about
p270
aVexplorers. I find exploration very interesting,
p271
aVArctic exploration, you know, people like Magellan,
p272
aVAmundsen, Shackleton, you see Franklin down there,
p273
aVScott, all these guys. It's really nifty, exploration.
p274
aVAnd they're just doing it because they want to explore,
p275
aVand you might say, "Oh, that's kind of a frivolous opportunity,"
p276
aVbut that's not frivolous. That's not a frivolous activity,
p277
aVbecause, I mean, think of ants.
p278
aVYou know, most ants are programmed to follow one another
p279
aValong in a long line, but there are a couple of ants,
p280
aVmaybe one percent of those ants, that are what they call
p281
aVpioneer ants, and they're the ones that wander off.
p282
aVThey're the ones you find on the kitchen countertop.
p283
aVYou gotta get them with your thumb before they
p284
aVfind the sugar or something.
p285
aVBut those ants, even though most of them get wiped out,
p286
aVthose ants are the ones that are essential to the survival
p287
aVof the hive. So exploration is important.
p288
aa(lp289
VI also think that exploration is important in terms of
p290
aVbeing able to address what I think is a critical
p291
aVlack in our society, and that is the lack of science literacy,
p292
aVthe lack of the ability to even understand science.
p293
aVNow, look, a lot has been written about the
p294
aVdeplorable state of science literacy in this country.
p295
aVYou've heard about it.
p296
aVWell, here's one example, in fact.
p297
aVPolls taken, this poll was taken 10 years ago.
p298
aVIt shows like roughly one third of the public thinks
p299
aVthat aliens are not only out there, we're looking for them
p300
aVout there, but they're here, right?
p301
aVSailing the skies in their saucers and occasionally
p302
aVabducting people for experiments their parents wouldn't approve of.
p303
aVWell, that would be interesting if it was true,
p304
aVand job security for me, but I don't think the evidence is
p305
aVvery good. That's more, you know, sad than significant.
p306
aa(lp307
VBut there are other things that people believe
p308
aVthat are significant, like the efficacy of homeopathy,
p309
aVor that evolution is just, you know, sort of a crazy idea
p310
aVby scientists without any legs, or, you know, evolution,
p311
aVall that sort of thing, or global warming.
p312
aVThese sorts of ideas don't really have any validity,
p313
aVthat you can't trust the scientists.
p314
aa(lp315
VNow, we've got to solve that problem, because that's
p316
aVa critically important problem, and you might say,
p317
aV"Well, okay, how are we gonna solve that problem with SETI?"
p318
aVWell, let me suggest to you that SETI obviously can't
p319
aVsolve the problem, but it can address the problem.
p320
aVIt can address the problem by getting young people
p321
aVinterested in science. Look, science is hard, it
p322
aVhas a reputation of being hard, and the facts are, it is hard,
p323
aVand that's the result of 400 years of science, right?
p324
aVI mean, in the 18th century, in the 18th century
p325
aVyou could become an expert on any field of science
p326
aVin an afternoon by going to a library,
p327
aVif you could find the library, right?
p328
aVIn the 19th century, if you had a basement lab,
p329
aVyou could make major scientific discoveries
p330
aVin your own home. Right? Because there was all this
p331
aVscience just lying around waiting for somebody to pick it up.
p332
aVNow, that's not true anymore.
p333
aVToday, you've got to spend years in grad school
p334
aVand post-doc positions just to figure out what
p335
aVthe important questions are.
p336
aVIt's hard. There's no doubt about it.
p337
aa(lp338
VAnd in fact, here's an example: the Higgs boson,
p339
aVfinding the Higgs boson.
p340
aVAsk the next 10 people you see on the streets,
p341
aV"Hey, do you think it's worthwhile to spend billions
p342
aVof Swiss francs looking for the Higgs boson?"
p343
aVAnd I bet the answer you're going to get, is,
p344
aV"Well, I don't know what the Higgs boson is,
p345
aVand I don't know if it's important."
p346
aVAnd probably most of the people wouldn't even know
p347
aVthe value of a Swiss franc, okay?
p348
aVAnd yet we're spending billions of Swiss francs on this problem.
p349
aVOkay? So that doesn't get people interested in science
p350
aVbecause they can't comprehend what it's about.
p351
aVSETI, on the other hand, is really simple.
p352
aVWe're going to use these big antennas and we're going to
p353
aVtry to eavesdrop on signals. Everybody can understand that.
p354
aVYes, technologically, it's very sophisticated,
p355
aVbut everybody gets the idea.
p356
aa(lp357
VSo that's one thing. The other thing is, it's exciting science.
p358
aVIt's exciting because we're naturally interested
p359
aVin other intelligent beings, and I think that's
p360
aVpart of our hardwiring.
p361
aVI mean, we're hardwired to be interested
p362
aVin beings that might be, if you will, competitors,
p363
aVor if you're the romantic sort, possibly even mates. Okay?
p364
aVI mean, this is analogous to our interest in things that
p365
aVhave big teeth. Right?
p366
aVWe're interested in things that have big teeth, and you
p367
aVcan see the evolutionary value of that, and you can also see
p368
aVthe practical consequences by watching Animal Planet.
p369
aVYou notice they make very few programs about gerbils.
p370
aVIt's mostly about things that have big teeth.
p371
aVOkay, so we're interested in these sorts of things.
p372
aVAnd not just us. It's also kids.
p373
aVThis allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a
p374
aVhook to science, because SETI involves all kinds of science,
p375
aVobviously biology, obviously astronomy,
p376
aVbut also geology, also chemistry, various scientific
p377
aVdisciplines all can be presented in the guise of,
p378
aV"We're looking for E.T."
p379
aVSo to me this is interesting and important, and in fact,
p380
aVit's my policy, even though I give a lot of talks to adults,
p381
aVyou give talks to adults, and two days later they're back where they were.
p382
aVBut if you give talks to kids, you know,
p383
aVone in 50 of them, some light bulb goes off, and they think,
p384
aV"Gee, I'd never thought of that," and then they go,
p385
aVyou know, read a book or a magazine or whatever.
p386
aVThey get interested in something.
p387
aa(lp388
VNow it's my theory, supported only by anecdotal,
p389
aVpersonal anecdotal evidence, but nonetheless,
p390
aVthat kids get interested in something between the ages
p391
aVof eight and 11. You've got to get them there.
p392
aVSo, all right, I give talks to adults, that's fine, but I try
p393
aVand make 10 percent of the talks that I give,
p394
aVI try and make those for kids.
p395
aVI remember when a guy came to our high school, actually,
p396
aVit was actually my junior high school. I was in sixth grade.
p397
aVAnd he gave some talk. All I remember from it
p398
aVwas one word: electronics.
p399
aVIt was like Dustin Hoffman in "The Graduate," right,
p400
aVwhen he said "plastics," whatever that means, plastics.
p401
aVAll right, so the guy said electronics. I don't remember
p402
aVanything else. In fact, I don't remember anything
p403
aVthat my sixth grade teacher said all year,
p404
aVbut I remember electronics.
p405
aVAnd so I got interested in electronics, and you know,
p406
aVI studied to get my ham license. I was wiring up stuff.
p407
aVHere I am at about 15 or something, doing that sort of stuff.
p408
aVOkay? That had a big effect on me.
p409
aVSo that's my point, that you can have a big effect
p410
aVon these kids.
p411
aa(lp412
VIn fact, this reminds me, I don't know, a couple years ago
p413
aVI gave a talk at a school in Palo Alto
p414
aVwhere there were about a dozen 11-year-olds
p415
aVthat had come to this talk.
p416
aVI had been brought in to talk to these kids for an hour.
p417
aVEleven-year-olds, they're all sitting in a little semi-circle
p418
aVlooking up at me with big eyes, and I started,
p419
aVthere was a white board behind me, and I started off
p420
aVby writing a one with 22 zeroes after it, and I said,
p421
aV"All right, now look, this is the number of stars
p422
aVin the visible universe, and this number is so big
p423
aVthere's not even a name for it."
p424
aVAnd one of these kids shot up his hand, and he said,
p425
aV"Well, actually there is a name for it.
p426
aVIt's a sextra-quadra-hexa-something or other." Right?
p427
aVNow, that kid was wrong by four orders of magnitude,
p428
aVbut there was no doubt about it, these kids were smart.
p429
aVOkay? So I stopped giving the lecture.
p430
aVAll they wanted to do was ask questions.
p431
aVIn fact, my last comments to these kids, at the end I said,
p432
aV"You know, you kids are smarter
p433
aVthan the people I work with." Now \u2014 (Laughter)
p434
aVThey didn't even care about that.
p435
aVWhat they wanted was my email address
p436
aVso they could ask me more questions. (Laughter)
p437
aa(lp438
VLet me just say, look, my job is a privilege
p439
aVbecause we're in a special time.
p440
aVPrevious generations couldn't do this experiment at all.
p441
aVIn another generation down the line,
p442
aVI think we will have succeeded.
p443
aVSo to me, it is a privilege, and when I look in the mirror,
p444
aVthe facts are that I really don't see myself.
p445
aVWhat I see is the generation behind me.
p446
aVThese are some kids from the Huff School, fourth graders.
p447
aVI talked there, what, two weeks ago, something like that.
p448
aa(lp449
VI think that if you can instill some interest in science
p450
aVand how it works, well, that's a payoff
p451
aVbeyond easy measure. Thank you very much.

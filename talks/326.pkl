VAs a particle physicist, I study the elementary particles
p5
aVand how they interact on the most fundamental level.
p6
aVFor most of my research career, I've been using accelerators,
p7
aVsuch as the electron accelerator at Stanford University, just up the road,
p8
aVto study things on the smallest scale.
p9
aVBut more recently, I've been turning my attention
p10
aVto the universe on the largest scale.
p11
aVBecause, as I'll explain to you,
p12
aVthe questions on the smallest and the largest scale are actually very connected.
p13
aVSo I'm going to tell you about our twenty-first-century view of the universe,
p14
aVwhat it's made of and what the big questions in the physical sciences are \u2014
p15
aVat least some of the big questions.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo, recently, we have realized
p18
aVthat the ordinary matter in the universe \u2014
p19
aVand by ordinary matter, I mean you, me,
p20
aVthe planets, the stars, the galaxies \u2014
p21
aVthe ordinary matter makes up only a few percent
p22
aVof the content of the universe.
p23
aVAlmost a quarter, or approximately a quarter
p24
aVof the matter in the universe, is stuff that's invisible.
p25
aVBy invisible, I mean it doesn't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum.
p26
aVIt doesn't emit in the electromagnetic spectrum. It doesn't reflect.
p27
aVIt doesn't interact with the electromagnetic spectrum,
p28
aVwhich is what we use to detect things.
p29
aVIt doesn't interact at all. So how do we know it's there?
p30
aVWe know it's there by its gravitational effects.
p31
aVIn fact, this dark matter dominates
p32
aVthe gravitational effects in the universe on a large scale,
p33
aVand I'll be telling you about the evidence for that.
p34
aa(lp35
VWhat about the rest of the pie?
p36
aVThe rest of the pie is a very mysterious substance called dark energy.
p37
aVMore about that later, OK.
p38
aVSo for now, let's turn to the evidence for dark matter.
p39
aVIn these galaxies, especially in a spiral galaxy like this,
p40
aVmost of the mass of the stars is concentrated in the middle of the galaxy.
p41
aVThis huge mass of all these stars keeps stars in circular orbits in the galaxy.
p42
aVSo we have these stars going around in circles like this.
p43
aVAs you can imagine, even if you know physics, this should be intuitive, OK \u2014
p44
aVthat stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed
p45
aVthan those that are further out here, OK.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars,
p48
aVthat they should be slower on the edges than on the inside.
p49
aVIn other words, if we measured speed as a function of distance \u2014
p50
aVthis is the only time I'm going to show a graph, OK \u2014
p51
aVwe would expect that it goes down as the distance increases
p52
aVfrom the center of the galaxy.
p53
aVWhen those measurements are made,
p54
aVinstead what we find is that the speed is basically constant,
p55
aVas a function of distance.
p56
aVIf it's constant, that means that the stars out here
p57
aVare feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see.
p58
aVIn fact, this galaxy and every other galaxy
p59
aVappears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter.
p60
aVAnd this cloud of matter is much more spherical than the galaxy themselves,
p61
aVand it extends over a much wider range than the galaxy.
p62
aVSo we see the galaxy and fixate on that, but it's actually a cloud of dark matter
p63
aVthat's dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy.
p64
aa(lp65
VGalaxies themselves are not strewn randomly in space;
p66
aVthey tend to cluster.
p67
aVAnd this is an example of a very, actually, famous cluster, the Coma cluster.
p68
aVAnd there are thousands of galaxies in this cluster.
p69
aVThey're the white, fuzzy, elliptical things here.
p70
aVSo these galaxy clusters \u2014 we take a snapshot now,
p71
aVwe take a snapshot in a decade, it'll look identical.
p72
aVBut these galaxies are actually moving at extremely high speeds.
p73
aVThey're moving around in this gravitational potential well of this cluster, OK.
p74
aVSo all of these galaxies are moving.
p75
aVWe can measure the speeds of these galaxies, their orbital velocities,
p76
aVand figure out how much mass is in this cluster.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd again, what we find is that there is much more mass there
p79
aVthan can be accounted for by the galaxies that we see.
p80
aVOr if we look in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum,
p81
aVwe see that there's a lot of gas in this cluster, as well.
p82
aVBut that cannot account for the mass either.
p83
aVIn fact, there appears to be about ten times as much mass here
p84
aVin the form of this invisible or dark matter
p85
aVas there is in the ordinary matter, OK.
p86
aVIt would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly.
p87
aVI'm just putting this big, blue blob on there, OK,
p88
aVto try to remind you that it's there.
p89
aVCan we see it more visually? Yes, we can.
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd so let me lead you through how we can do this.
p92
aVSo here's an observer:
p93
aVit could be an eye; it could be a telescope.
p94
aVAnd suppose there's a galaxy out here in the universe.
p95
aVHow do we see that galaxy?
p96
aVA ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe
p97
aVfor perhaps billions of years
p98
aVbefore it enters the telescope or your eye.
p99
aVNow, how do we deduce where the galaxy is?
p100
aVWell, we deduce it by the direction that the ray is traveling
p101
aVas it enters our eye, right?
p102
aVWe say, the ray of light came this way;
p103
aVthe galaxy must be there, OK.
p104
aVNow, suppose I put in the middle a cluster of galaxies \u2014
p105
aVand don't forget the dark matter, OK.
p106
aVNow, if we consider a different ray of light, one going off like this,
p107
aVwe now need to take into account
p108
aVwhat Einstein predicted when he developed general relativity.
p109
aVAnd that was that the gravitational field, due to mass,
p110
aVwill deflect not only the trajectory of particles,
p111
aVbut will deflect light itself.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo this light ray will not continue in a straight line,
p114
aVbut would rather bend and could end up going into our eye.
p115
aVWhere will this observer see the galaxy?
p116
aVYou can respond. Up, right?
p117
aVWe extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here.
p118
aVIs there any other ray of light
p119
aVthat could make into the observer's eye from that galaxy?
p120
aVYes, great. I see people going down like this.
p121
aVSo a ray of light could go down, be bent
p122
aVup into the observer's eye,
p123
aVand the observer sees a ray of light here.
p124
aa(lp125
VNow, take into account the fact that we live in
p126
aVa three-dimensional universe, OK,
p127
aVa three-dimensional space.
p128
aVAre there any other rays of light that could make it into the eye?
p129
aVYes! The rays would lie on a \u2014 I'd like to see \u2014 yeah, on a cone.
p130
aVSo there's a whole ray of light \u2014 rays of light on a cone \u2014
p131
aVthat will all be bent by that cluster
p132
aVand make it into the observer's eye.
p133
aVIf there is a cone of light coming into my eye, what do I see?
p134
aVA circle, a ring. It's called an Einstein ring. Einstein predicted that, OK.
p135
aVNow, it will only be a perfect ring if the source, the deflector
p136
aVand the eyeball, in this case, are all in a perfectly straight line.
p137
aVIf they're slightly skewed, we'll see a different image.
p138
aa(lp139
VNow, you can do an experiment tonight over the reception, OK,
p140
aVto figure out what that image will look like.
p141
aVBecause it turns out that there is a kind of lens that we can devise,
p142
aVthat has the right shape to produce this kind of effect.
p143
aVWe call this gravitational lensing.
p144
aVAnd so, this is your instrument, OK.
p145
aV(Laughter).
p146
aVBut ignore the top part.
p147
aVIt's the base that I want you to concentrate, OK.
p148
aVSo, actually, at home, whenever we break a wineglass,
p149
aVI save the bottom, take it over to the machine shop.
p150
aVWe shave it off, and I have a little gravitational lens, OK.
p151
aVSo it's got the right shape to produce the lensing.
p152
aVAnd so the next thing you need to do in your experiment
p153
aVis grab a napkin. I grabbed a piece of graph paper \u2014 I'm a physicist. (Laughter)
p154
aVSo, a napkin. Draw a little model galaxy in the middle.
p155
aVAnd now put the lens over the galaxy,
p156
aVand what you'll find is that you'll see a ring, an Einstein ring.
p157
aVNow, move the base off to the side,
p158
aVand the ring will split up into arcs, OK.
p159
aVAnd you can put it on top of any image.
p160
aVOn the graph paper, you can see
p161
aVhow all the lines on the graph paper have been distorted.
p162
aVAnd again, this is a kind of an accurate model
p163
aVof what happens with the gravitational lensing.
p164
aa(lp165
VOK, so the question is: do we see this in the sky?
p166
aVDo we see arcs in the sky when we look at, say, a cluster of galaxies?
p167
aVAnd the answer is yes.
p168
aVAnd so, here's an image from the Hubble Space Telescope.
p169
aVMany of the images you are seeing
p170
aVare earlier from the Hubble Space Telescope.
p171
aVWell, first of all, for the golden shape galaxies \u2014
p172
aVthose are the galaxies in the cluster.
p173
aVThey're the ones that are embedded in that sea of dark matter
p174
aVthat are causing the bending of the light
p175
aVto cause these optical illusions, or mirages, practically,
p176
aVof the background galaxies.
p177
aVSo the streaks that you see, all these streaks,
p178
aVare actually distorted images of galaxies that are much further away.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo what we can do, then, is based on how much distortion
p181
aVwe see in those images, we can calculate how much mass
p182
aVthere must be in this cluster.
p183
aVAnd it's an enormous amount of mass.
p184
aVAnd also, you can tell by eye, by looking at this,
p185
aVthat these arcs are not centered on individual galaxies.
p186
aVThey are centered on some more spread out structure,
p187
aVand that is the dark matter
p188
aVin which the cluster is embedded, OK.
p189
aVSo this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing
p190
aVat least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye.
p191
aa(lp192
VOK, so, a quick review then, to see that you're following.
p193
aVSo the evidence that we have
p194
aVthat a quarter of the universe is dark matter \u2014
p195
aVthis gravitationally attracting stuff \u2014
p196
aVis that galaxies, the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies
p197
aVis much too large; it must be embedded in dark matter.
p198
aVThe speed with which galaxies within clusters are orbiting is much too large;
p199
aVit must be embedded in dark matter.
p200
aVAnd we see these gravitational lensing effects, these distortions
p201
aVthat say that, again, clusters are embedded in dark matter.
p202
aa(lp203
VOK. So now, let's turn to dark energy.
p204
aVSo to understand the evidence for dark energy, we need to discuss something
p205
aVthat Stephen Hawking referred to in the previous session.
p206
aVAnd that is the fact that space itself is expanding.
p207
aVSo if we imagine a section of our infinite universe \u2014
p208
aVand so I've put down four spiral galaxies, OK \u2014
p209
aVand imagine that you put down a set of tape measures,
p210
aVso every line on here corresponds to a tape measure,
p211
aVhorizontal or vertical, for measuring where things are.
p212
aVIf you could do this, what you would find
p213
aVthat with each passing day, each passing year,
p214
aVeach passing billions of years, OK,
p215
aVthe distance between galaxies is getting greater.
p216
aVAnd it's not because galaxies are moving
p217
aVaway from each other through space.
p218
aVThey're not necessarily moving through space.
p219
aVThey're moving away from each other
p220
aVbecause space itself is getting bigger, OK.
p221
aVThat's what the expansion of the universe or space means.
p222
aVSo they're moving further apart.
p223
aa(lp224
VNow, what Stephen Hawking mentioned, as well,
p225
aVis that after the Big Bang, space expanded at a very rapid rate.
p226
aVBut because gravitationally attracting matter
p227
aVis embedded in this space,
p228
aVit tends to slow down the expansion of the space, OK.
p229
aVSo the expansion slows down with time.
p230
aVSo, in the last century, OK, people debated
p231
aVabout whether this expansion of space would continue forever;
p232
aVwhether it would slow down, you know,
p233
aVwill be slowing down, but continue forever;
p234
aVslow down and stop, asymptotically stop;
p235
aVor slow down, stop, and then reverse, so it starts to contract again.
p236
aVSo a little over a decade ago,
p237
aVtwo groups of physicists and astronomers
p238
aVset out to measure the rate at which
p239
aVthe expansion of space was slowing down, OK.
p240
aVBy how much less is it expanding today,
p241
aVcompared to, say, a couple of billion years ago?
p242
aa(lp243
VThe startling answer to this question, OK, from these experiments,
p244
aVwas that space is expanding at a faster rate today
p245
aVthan it was a few billion years ago, OK.
p246
aVSo the expansion of space is actually speeding up.
p247
aVThis was a completely surprising result.
p248
aVThere is no persuasive theoretical argument for why this should happen, OK.
p249
aVNo one was predicting ahead of time this is what's going to be found.
p250
aVIt was the opposite of what was expected.
p251
aVSo we need something to be able to explain that.
p252
aVNow it turns out, in the mathematics,
p253
aVyou can put it in as a term that's an energy,
p254
aVbut it's a completely different type of energy
p255
aVfrom anything we've ever seen before.
p256
aVWe call it dark energy,
p257
aVand it has this effect of causing space to expand.
p258
aVBut we don't have a good motivation
p259
aVfor putting it in there at this point, OK.
p260
aVSo it's really unexplained as to why we need to put it in.
p261
aa(lp262
VNow, so at this point, then, what I want to really emphasize to you,
p263
aVis that, first of all, dark matter and dark energy
p264
aVare completely different things, OK.
p265
aVThere are really two mysteries out there as to what makes up most of the universe,
p266
aVand they have very different effects.
p267
aVDark matter, because it gravitationally attracts,
p268
aVit tends to encourage the growth of structure, OK.
p269
aVSo clusters of galaxies will tend to form,
p270
aVbecause of all this gravitational attraction.
p271
aVDark energy, on the other hand,
p272
aVis putting more and more space between the galaxies,
p273
aVmakes it, the gravitational attraction between them decrease,
p274
aVand so it impedes the growth of structure.
p275
aVSo by looking at things like clusters of galaxies,
p276
aVand how they \u2014 their number density,
p277
aVhow many there are as a function of time \u2014
p278
aVwe can learn about how dark matter and dark energy
p279
aVcompete against each other in structure forming.
p280
aa(lp281
VIn terms of dark matter, I said that we don't have any,
p282
aVyou know, really persuasive argument for dark energy.
p283
aVDo we have anything for dark matter? And the answer is yes.
p284
aVWe have well-motivated candidates for the dark matter.
p285
aVNow, what do I mean by well motivated?
p286
aVI mean that we have mathematically consistent theories
p287
aVthat were actually introduced
p288
aVto explain a completely different phenomenon, OK,
p289
aVthings that I haven't even talked about,
p290
aVthat each predict the existence
p291
aVof a very weakly interacting, new particle.
p292
aa(lp293
VSo, this is exactly what you want in physics:
p294
aVwhere a prediction comes out of a mathematically consistent theory
p295
aVthat was actually developed for something else.
p296
aVBut we don't know if either of those
p297
aVare actually the dark matter candidate, OK.
p298
aVOne or both, who knows? Or it could be something completely different.
p299
aVNow, we look for these dark matter particles
p300
aVbecause, after all, they are here in the room, OK,
p301
aVand they didn't come in the door.
p302
aVThey just pass through anything.
p303
aVThey can come through the building, through the Earth \u2014
p304
aVthey're so non-interacting.
p305
aa(lp306
VSo one way to look for them is to build detectors
p307
aVthat are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it.
p308
aVSo a crystal that will ring if that happens.
p309
aVSo one of my colleagues up the road and his collaborators
p310
aVhave built such a detector.
p311
aVAnd they've put it deep down in an iron mine in Minnesota,
p312
aVOK, deep under the ground, and in fact, in the last couple of days
p313
aVannounced the most sensitive results so far.
p314
aVThey haven't seen anything, OK, but it puts limits on what the mass
p315
aVand the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are.
p316
aVThere's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year
p317
aVand it will look towards the middle of the galaxy,
p318
aVto see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating
p319
aVand producing gamma rays that could be detected with this.
p320
aVThe Large Hadron Collider, a particle physics accelerator,
p321
aVthat we'll be turning on later this year.
p322
aVIt is possible that dark matter particles might be produced
p323
aVat the Large Hadron Collider.
p324
aa(lp325
VNow, because they are so non-interactive,
p326
aVthey will actually escape the detector,
p327
aVso their signature will be missing energy, OK.
p328
aVNow, unfortunately, there is a lot of new physics
p329
aVwhose signature could be missing energy,
p330
aVso it will be hard to tell the difference.
p331
aVAnd finally, for future endeavors, there are telescopes being designed
p332
aVspecifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy \u2014
p333
aVground-based telescopes, and there are three space-based telescopes
p334
aVthat are in competition right now
p335
aVto be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy.
p336
aVSo in terms of the big questions:
p337
aVwhat is dark matter? What is dark energy?
p338
aVThe big questions facing physics.
p339
aVAnd I'm sure you have lots of questions,
p340
aVwhich I very much look forward to addressing
p341
aVover the next 72 hours, while I'm here. Thank you.

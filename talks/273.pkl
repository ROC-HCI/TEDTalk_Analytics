VYou know, culture was born of the imagination,
p5
aVand the imagination \u2014 the imagination as we know it \u2014
p6
aVcame into being when our species descended
p7
aVfrom our progenitor, Homo erectus,
p8
aVand, infused with consciousness, began a journey that would carry it
p9
aVto every corner of the habitable world.
p10
aVFor a time, we shared the stage with our distant cousins, Neanderthal,
p11
aVwho clearly had some spark of awareness,
p12
aVbut \u2014 whether it was the increase in the size of the brain,
p13
aVor the development of language,
p14
aVor some other evolutionary catalyst \u2014
p15
aVwe quickly left Neanderthal gasping for survival.
p16
aVBy the time the last Neanderthal disappeared in Europe,
p17
aV27,000 years ago,
p18
aVour direct ancestors had already,
p19
aVand for 5,000 years,
p20
aVbeen crawling into the belly of the earth,
p21
aVwhere in the light of the flickers of tallow candles,
p22
aVthey had brought into being
p23
aVthe great art of the Upper Paleolithic.
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd I spent two months in the caves of southwest France
p26
aVwith the poet Clayton Eshleman, who wrote a beautiful book called "Juniper Fuse."
p27
aVAnd you could look at this art and you could, of course,
p28
aVsee the complex social organization
p29
aVof the people who brought it into being.
p30
aVBut more importantly, it spoke of a deeper yearning,
p31
aVsomething far more sophisticated than hunting magic.
p32
aVAnd the way Clayton put it was this way.
p33
aVHe said, "You know, clearly at some point,
p34
aVwe were all of an animal nature, and at some point, we weren't."
p35
aVAnd he viewed proto-shamanism as a kind of original attempt,
p36
aVthrough ritual, to rekindle a connection
p37
aVthat had been irrevocably lost.
p38
aVSo, he saw this art not as
p39
aVhunting magic, but as postcards of nostalgia.
p40
aVAnd viewed in that light,
p41
aVit takes on a whole other resonance.
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd the most amazing thing about the Upper Paleolithic art
p44
aVis that as an aesthetic expression,
p45
aVit lasted for almost 20,000 years.
p46
aVIf these were postcards of nostalgia,
p47
aVours was a very long farewell indeed.
p48
aVAnd it was also the beginning of our discontent,
p49
aVbecause if you wanted to distill all of our experience
p50
aVsince the Paleolithic, it would come down to two words:
p51
aVhow and why.
p52
aVAnd these are the slivers of insight upon which cultures have been forged.
p53
aVNow, all people share the same
p54
aVraw, adaptive imperatives.
p55
aVWe all have children.
p56
aVWe all have to deal with the mystery of death,
p57
aVthe world that waits beyond death,
p58
aVthe elders who fall away into their elderly years.
p59
aVAll of this is part of our common experience,
p60
aVand this shouldn't surprise us, because, after all,
p61
aVbiologists have finally proven it to be true,
p62
aVsomething that philosophers have always dreamt to be true.
p63
aVAnd that is the fact that we are all brothers and sisters.
p64
aVWe are all cut from the same genetic cloth.
p65
aVAll of humanity, probably, is descended from a thousand people
p66
aVwho left Africa roughly 70,000 years ago.
p67
aa(lp68
VBut the corollary of that is that,
p69
aVif we all are brothers and sisters
p70
aVand share the same genetic material,
p71
aVall human populations share the same raw human genius,
p72
aVthe same intellectual acuity.
p73
aVAnd so whether that genius is placed
p74
aVinto \u2014 technological wizardry
p75
aVhas been the great achievement of the West \u2014
p76
aVor by contrast, into unraveling the complex threads
p77
aVof memory inherent in a myth,
p78
aVis simply a matter of choice and cultural orientation.
p79
aVThere is no progression of affairs
p80
aVin human experience.
p81
aVThere is no trajectory of progress. There's no pyramid
p82
aVthat conveniently places Victorian England at the apex
p83
aVand descends down the flanks
p84
aVto the so-called primitives of the world.
p85
aVAll peoples are simply cultural options,
p86
aVdifferent visions of life itself.
p87
aVBut what do I mean by different visions of life
p88
aVmaking for completely different
p89
aVpossibilities for existence?
p90
aa(lp91
VWell, let's slip for a moment into the greatest culture sphere
p92
aVever brought into being by the imagination,
p93
aVthat of Polynesia.
p94
aV10,000 square kilometers,
p95
aVtens of thousands of islands flung like jewels upon the southern sea.
p96
aVI recently sailed on the Hokulea,
p97
aVnamed after the sacred star of Hawaii,
p98
aVthroughout the South Pacific to make a film
p99
aVabout the navigators.
p100
aVThese are men and women who, even today, can name
p101
aV250 stars in the night sky.
p102
aVThese are men and women who can sense the presence of distant atolls
p103
aVof islands beyond the visible horizon,
p104
aVsimply by watching the reverberation of waves
p105
aVacross the hull of their vessel, knowing full well
p106
aVthat every island group in the Pacific
p107
aVhas its unique refractive pattern
p108
aVthat can be read with the same perspicacity
p109
aVwith which a forensic scientist would read a fingerprint.
p110
aVThese are sailors who in the darkness, in the hull of the vessel,
p111
aVcan distinguish as many as 32 different sea swells
p112
aVmoving through the canoe at any one point in time,
p113
aVdistinguishing local wave disturbances
p114
aVfrom the great currents that pulsate across the ocean,
p115
aVthat can be followed with the same ease
p116
aVthat a terrestrial explorer would follow a river to the sea.
p117
aVIndeed, if you took all of the genius
p118
aVthat allowed us to put a man on the moon
p119
aVand applied it to an understanding of the ocean,
p120
aVwhat you would get is Polynesia.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd if we slip from the realm of the sea
p123
aVinto the realm of the spirit of the imagination,
p124
aVyou enter the realm of Tibetan Buddhism.
p125
aVAnd I recently made a film called "The Buddhist Science of the Mind."
p126
aVWhy did we use that word, science?
p127
aVWhat is science but the empirical pursuit of the truth?
p128
aVWhat is Buddhism but 2,500 years
p129
aVof empirical observation
p130
aVas to the nature of mind?
p131
aVI travelled for a month in Nepal with our good friend, Matthieu Ricard,
p132
aVand you'll remember Matthieu famously said to all of us
p133
aVhere once at TED,
p134
aV"Western science is a major response to minor needs."
p135
aVWe spend all of our lifetime trying to live to be 100
p136
aVwithout losing our teeth.
p137
aVThe Buddhist spends all their lifetime trying to understand the nature of existence.
p138
aa(lp139
VOur billboards celebrate naked children in underwear.
p140
aVTheir billboards are manuals,
p141
aVprayers to the well-being of all sentient creatures.
p142
aVAnd with the blessing of Trulshik Rinpoche, we began a pilgrimage
p143
aVto a curious destination,
p144
aVaccompanied by a great doctor.
p145
aVAnd the destination was a single room in a nunnery,
p146
aVwhere a woman had gone into lifelong retreat
p147
aV55 years before.
p148
aVAnd en route, we took darshan from Rinpoche,
p149
aVand he sat with us and told us about the Four Noble Truths,
p150
aVthe essence of the Buddhist path.
p151
aVAll life is suffering. That doesn't mean all life is negative.
p152
aVIt means things happen.
p153
aVThe cause of suffering is ignorance.
p154
aVBy that, the Buddha did not mean stupidity;
p155
aVhe meant clinging to the illusion
p156
aVthat life is static and predictable.
p157
aVThe third noble truth said that ignorance can be overcome.
p158
aVAnd the fourth and most important, of course,
p159
aVwas the delineation of a contemplative practice
p160
aVthat not only had the possibility
p161
aVof a transformation of the human heart,
p162
aVbut had 2,500 years of empirical evidence
p163
aVthat such a transformation was a certainty.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd so, when this door opened onto the face of a woman
p166
aVwho had not been out of that room in 55 years,
p167
aVyou did not see a mad woman.
p168
aVYou saw a woman who was more clear
p169
aVthan a pool of water in a mountain stream.
p170
aVAnd of course, this is what the Tibetan monks told us.
p171
aVThey said, at one point, you know, we don't really believe
p172
aVyou went to the moon, but you did.
p173
aVYou may not believe that we achieve enlightenment
p174
aVin one lifetime, but we do.
p175
aVAnd if we move from the realm of the spirit
p176
aVto the realm of the physical,
p177
aVto the sacred geography of Peru \u2014
p178
aVI've always been interested in the relationships of indigenous people
p179
aVthat literally believe that the Earth is alive,
p180
aVresponsive to all of their aspirations,
p181
aVall of their needs.
p182
aVAnd, of course, the human population
p183
aVhas its own reciprocal obligations.
p184
aa(lp185
VI spent 30 years living amongst
p186
aVthe people of Chinchero
p187
aVand I always heard about an event that I always wanted to participate in.
p188
aVOnce each year, the fastest young boy
p189
aVin each hamlet is given the honor of becoming a woman.
p190
aVAnd for one day, he wears the clothing of his sister
p191
aVand he becomes a transvestite,
p192
aVa waylaka. And for that day,
p193
aVhe leads all able-bodied men on a run,
p194
aVbut it's not your ordinary run.
p195
aVYou start off at 11,500 feet.
p196
aVYou run down to the base of the sacred mountain, Antakillqa.
p197
aVYou run up to 15,000 feet,
p198
aVdescend 3,000 feet.
p199
aVClimb again over the course of 24 hours.
p200
aVAnd of course, the waylakama spin,
p201
aVthe trajectory of the route,
p202
aVis marked by holy mounds of Earth,
p203
aVwhere coke is given to the Earth, libations of alcohol to the wind,
p204
aVthe vortex of the feminine is brought to the mountaintop.
p205
aVAnd the metaphor is clear: you go into the mountain as an individual,
p206
aVbut through exhaustion, through sacrifice,
p207
aVyou emerge as a community that has once again
p208
aVreaffirmed its sense of place in the planet.
p209
aVAnd at 48, I was the only outsider ever to go through this,
p210
aVonly one to finish it.
p211
aVI only managed to do it by chewing more coca leaves in one day
p212
aVthan anyone in the 4,000-year history of the plant.
p213
aa(lp214
VBut these localized rituals become pan-Andean,
p215
aVand these fantastic festivals,
p216
aVlike that of the Qoyllur Rit'i, which occurs
p217
aVwhen the Pleiades reappear in the winter sky.
p218
aVIt's kind of like an Andean Woodstock:
p219
aV60,000 Indians on pilgrimage
p220
aVto the end of a dirt road
p221
aVthat leads to the sacred valley, called the Sinakara,
p222
aVwhich is dominated by three tongues
p223
aVof the great glacier.
p224
aVThe metaphor is so clear. You bring the crosses from your community,
p225
aVin this wonderful fusion of Christian
p226
aVand pre-Columbian ideas.
p227
aVYou place the cross into the ice,
p228
aVin the shadow of Ausangate, the most sacred of all Apus,
p229
aVor sacred mountains of the Inca.
p230
aVAnd then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses.
p231
aa(lp232
VNow, these ideas and these events
p233
aVallow us even to deconstruct iconic places
p234
aVthat many of you have been to, like Machu Picchu.
p235
aVMachu Picchu was never a lost city.
p236
aVOn the contrary, it was completely linked in
p237
aVto the 14,000 kilometers of royal roads
p238
aVthe Inca made in less than a century.
p239
aVBut more importantly, it was linked in
p240
aVto the Andean notions of sacred geography.
p241
aVThe intiwatana, the hitching post to the sun,
p242
aVis actually an obelisk that constantly reflects the light
p243
aVthat falls on the sacred Apu of Machu Picchu,
p244
aVwhich is Sugarloaf Mountain, called Huayna Picchu.
p245
aVIf you come to the south of the intiwatana, you find an altar.
p246
aVClimb Huayna Picchu, find another altar.
p247
aVTake a direct north-south bearing,
p248
aVyou find to your astonishment
p249
aVthat it bisects the intiwatana stone,
p250
aVgoes to the skyline,
p251
aVhits the heart of Salcantay, the second of the most important mountains
p252
aVof the Incan empire.
p253
aVAnd then beyond Salcantay, of course,
p254
aVwhen the southern cross reaches the southernmost point in the sky,
p255
aVdirectly in that same alignment, the Milky Way overhead.
p256
aVBut what is enveloping Machu Picchu from below?
p257
aVThe sacred river, the Urubamba, or the Vilcanota,
p258
aVwhich is itself the Earthly equivalent of the Milky Way,
p259
aVbut it's also the trajectory that Viracocha walked
p260
aVat the dawn of time when he brought the universe into being.
p261
aVAnd where does the river rise?
p262
aVRight on the slopes of the Koariti.
p263
aa(lp264
VSo, 500 years after Columbus,
p265
aVthese ancient rhythms of landscape
p266
aVare played out in ritual.
p267
aVNow, when I was here at the first TED,
p268
aVI showed this photograph: two men of the Elder Brothers,
p269
aVthe descendants, survivors of El Dorado.
p270
aVThese, of course, are the descendants
p271
aVof the ancient Tairona civilization.
p272
aVIf those of you who are here remember that I mentioned
p273
aVthat they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood,
p274
aVbut the training for the priesthood is extraordinary.
p275
aVTaken from their families, sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness
p276
aVfor 18 years \u2014 two nine-year periods deliberately chosen
p277
aVto evoke the nine months they spend in the natural mother's womb.
p278
aVAll that time, the world only exists as an abstraction,
p279
aVas they are taught the values of their society.
p280
aVValues that maintain the proposition that their prayers,
p281
aVand their prayers alone, maintain the cosmic balance.
p282
aVNow, the measure of a society is not only what it does,
p283
aVbut the quality of its aspirations.
p284
aa(lp285
VAnd I always wanted to go back into these mountains,
p286
aVto see if this could possibly be true,
p287
aVas indeed had been reported by the great anthropologist,
p288
aVReichel-Dolmatoff.
p289
aVSo, literally two weeks ago,
p290
aVI returned from having spent six weeks with the Elder Brothers
p291
aVon what was clearly the most
p292
aVextraordinary trip of my life.
p293
aVThese really are a people who live and breathe
p294
aVthe realm of the sacred,
p295
aVa baroque religiosity that is simply awesome.
p296
aVThey consume more coca leaves than any human population,
p297
aVhalf a pound per man, per day.
p298
aVThe gourd you see here is \u2014
p299
aVeverything in their lives is symbolic.
p300
aVTheir central metaphor is a loom.
p301
aVThey say, "Upon this loom, I weave my life."
p302
aVThey refer to the movements as they exploit the ecological niches of the gradient
p303
aVas "threads."
p304
aVWhen they pray for the dead, they make these gestures with their hands,
p305
aVspinning their thoughts into the heavens.
p306
aa(lp307
VYou can see the calcium buildup on the head of the poporo gourd.
p308
aVThe gourd is a feminine aspect; the stick is a male.
p309
aVYou put the stick in the powder
p310
aVto take the sacred ashes \u2014 well, they're not ashes,
p311
aVthey're burnt limestone \u2014
p312
aVto empower the coca leaf, to change
p313
aVthe pH of the mouth to facilitate the absorption
p314
aVof cocaine hydrochloride.
p315
aVBut if you break a gourd, you cannot simply throw it away,
p316
aVbecause every stroke of that stick
p317
aVthat has built up that calcium,
p318
aVthe measure of a man's life,
p319
aVhas a thought behind it.
p320
aVFields are planted in such an extraordinary way,
p321
aVthat the one side of the field
p322
aVis planted like that by the women.
p323
aVThe other side is planted like that by the men. Metaphorically,
p324
aVyou turn it on the side, and you have a piece of cloth.
p325
aVAnd they are the descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization,
p326
aVthe greatest goldsmiths of South America,
p327
aVwho in the wake of the conquest,
p328
aVretreated into this isolated volcanic massif
p329
aVthat soars to 20,000 feet
p330
aVabove the Caribbean coastal plain.
p331
aa(lp332
VThere are four societies:
p333
aVthe Kogi, the Wiwa, the Kankwano and the Arhuacos.
p334
aVI traveled with the Arhuacos,
p335
aVand the wonderful thing about this story
p336
aVwas that this man, Danilo Villafane \u2014
p337
aVif we just jump back here for a second.
p338
aVWhen I first met Danilo, in the Colombian embassy in Washington,
p339
aVI couldn't help but say, "You know,
p340
aVyou look a lot like an old friend of mine."
p341
aVWell, it turns out he was the son of my friend, Adalberto,
p342
aVfrom 1974, who had been killed by the FARC.
p343
aVAnd I said, "Danilo, you won't remember this,
p344
aVbut when you were an infant, I carried you on my back,
p345
aVup and down the mountains."
p346
aVAnd because of that, Danilo invited us
p347
aVto go to the very heart of the world,
p348
aVa place where no journalist had ever been permitted.
p349
aVNot simply to the flanks of the mountains,
p350
aVbut to the very iced peaks which are the destiny of the pilgrims.
p351
aa(lp352
VAnd this man sitting cross-legged
p353
aVis now a grown-up Eugenio,
p354
aVa man who I've known since 1974.
p355
aVAnd this is one of those initiates.
p356
aVNo, it's not true that they're kept in the darkness for 18 years,
p357
aVbut they are kept within the confines
p358
aVof the ceremonial men's circle
p359
aVfor 18 years.
p360
aVThis little boy will never step outside
p361
aVof the sacred fields
p362
aVthat surround the men's hut for all that time,
p363
aVuntil he begins his journey of initiation.
p364
aVFor that entire time, the world only exists as an abstraction,
p365
aVas he is taught the values of society,
p366
aVincluding this notion that their prayers alone
p367
aVmaintain the cosmic balance.
p368
aVBefore we could begin our journey,
p369
aVwe had to be cleansed at the portal of the Earth.
p370
aVAnd it was extraordinary to be taken by a priest.
p371
aVAnd you see that the priest never wears shoes because holy feet \u2014
p372
aVthere must be nothing between the feet
p373
aVand the Earth for a mamo.
p374
aVAnd this is actually the place where the Great Mother
p375
aVsent the spindle into the world
p376
aVthat elevated the mountains and created the homeland
p377
aVthat they call the heart of the world.
p378
aa(lp379
VWe traveled high into the paramo,
p380
aVand as we crested the hills,
p381
aVwe realized that the men were interpreting
p382
aVevery single bump on the landscape
p383
aVin terms of their own intense religiosity.
p384
aVAnd then of course, as we reached our final destination,
p385
aVa place called Mamancana,
p386
aVwe were in for a surprise,
p387
aVbecause the FARC were waiting to kidnap us.
p388
aVAnd so we ended up being taken aside into these huts,
p389
aVhidden away until the darkness.
p390
aVAnd then, abandoning all our gear,
p391
aVwe were forced to ride out in the middle of the night,
p392
aVin a quite dramatic scene.
p393
aVIt's going to look like a John Ford Western.
p394
aVAnd we ran into a FARC patrol at dawn, so it was quite harrowing.
p395
aVIt will be a very interesting film. But what was fascinating
p396
aVis that the minute there was a sense of dangers,
p397
aVthe mamos went into a circle of divination.
p398
aa(lp399
VAnd of course, this is a photograph
p400
aVliterally taken the night we were in hiding,
p401
aVas they divine their route
p402
aVto take us out of the mountains.
p403
aVWe were able to, because we had trained
p404
aVpeople in filmmaking,
p405
aVcontinue with our work,
p406
aVand send our Wiwa and Arhuaco filmmakers
p407
aVto the final sacred lakes
p408
aVto get the last shots for the film,
p409
aVand we followed the rest of the Arhuaco back to the sea,
p410
aVtaking the elements from the highlands to the sea.
p411
aVAnd here you see how their sacred landscape
p412
aVhas been covered by brothels and hotels and casinos,
p413
aVand yet, still they pray.
p414
aVAnd it's an amazing thing to think
p415
aVthat this close to Miami,
p416
aVtwo hours from Miami, there is an entire civilization of people
p417
aVpraying every day for your well-being.
p418
aVThey call themselves the Elder Brothers.
p419
aVThey dismiss the rest of us who have ruined the world
p420
aVas the Younger Brothers. They cannot understand
p421
aVwhy it is that we do what we do to the Earth.
p422
aa(lp423
VNow, if we slip to another end of the world,
p424
aVI was up in the high Arctic
p425
aVto tell a story about global warming,
p426
aVinspired in part by
p427
aVthe former Vice President's wonderful book.
p428
aVAnd what struck me so extraordinary
p429
aVwas to be again with the Inuit \u2014
p430
aVa people who don't fear the cold, but take advantage of it.
p431
aVA people who
p432
aVfind a way, with their imagination,
p433
aVto carve life out of that very frozen.
p434
aVA people for whom blood on ice
p435
aVis not a sign of death, but an affirmation of life.
p436
aVAnd yet tragically, when you now go to those northern communities,
p437
aVyou find to your astonishment

p440
aVin a place like Kanak in northern Greenland,
p441
aVit literally comes in now in November
p442

p443
aVSo, their entire year has been cut in half.

aa(lp445
VNow, I want to stress that none of these peoples
p446
aVthat I've been quickly talking about here
p447
aVare disappearing worlds.
p448
aVThese are not dying peoples.
p449
aVOn the contrary, you know,
p450
aVif you have the heart to feel and the eyes to see,
p451
aVyou discover that the world is not flat.
p452
aVThe world remains a rich tapestry.
p453
aVIt remains a rich topography of the spirit.
p454
aVThese myriad voices of humanity
p455
aVare not failed attempts at being new,
p456
aVfailed attempts at being modern.
p457
aVThey're unique facets of the human imagination.
p458
aVThey're unique answers to a fundamental question:
p459
aVwhat does it mean to be human and alive?
p460
aVAnd when asked that question, they respond
p461
aVwith 6,000 different voices.
p462
aVAnd collectively, those voices become our human repertoire
p463
aVfor dealing with the challenges that will confront us
p464
aVin the ensuing millennia.
p465
aa(lp466
VOur industrial society is scarcely
p467
aV300 years old.
p468
aVThat shallow history shouldn't suggest to anyone
p469
aVthat we have all of the answers
p470
aVfor all of the questions that will confront us
p471
aVin the ensuing millennia.
p472
aVThe myriad voices of humanity are not failed attempts at being us.
p473
aVThey are unique answers to that fundamental question:
p474
aVwhat does it mean to be human and alive?
p475
aVAnd there is indeed a fire burning over the Earth,
p476
aVtaking with it not only plants and animals,
p477
aVbut the legacy of humanity's brilliance.
p478
aa(lp479
VRight now, as we sit here in this room,
p480
aVof those 6,000 languages spoken the day that you were born,
p481
aVfully half aren't being taught to children.
p482
aVSo, you're living through a time
p483
aVwhen virtually half of humanity's intellectual,
p484
aVsocial and spiritual legacy
p485
aVis being allowed to slip away.
p486
aVThis does not have to happen.
p487
aVThese peoples are not failed attempts at being modern \u2014
p488
aVquaint and colorful and destined to fade away
p489
aVas if by natural law.
p490
aa(lp491
VIn every case, these are dynamic, living peoples
p492
aVbeing driven out of existence by identifiable forces.
p493
aVThat's actually an optimistic observation,
p494
aVbecause it suggests that if human beings
p495
aVare the agents of cultural destruction,
p496
aVwe can also be, and must be,
p497
aVthe facilitators of cultural survival.
p498
aa(lp499
VThank you very much.

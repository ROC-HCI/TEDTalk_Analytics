VSo when I was a kid ...
p5
aVthis was my team.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VI stunk at sports.
p10
aVI didn't like to play them, I didn't like to watch them.
p11
aVSo this is what I did. I went fishing.
p12
aVAnd for all of my growing up I fished on the shores of Connecticut,
p13
aVand these are the creatures that I saw on a regular basis.
p14
aVBut after I grew up and went to college,
p15
aVand I came home in the early 90's,
p16
aVthis is what I found.
p17
aVMy team had shrunk.
p18
aVIt was like literally having your roster devastated.
p19
aVAnd as I sort of looked into that,
p20
aVfrom a very personal point of view as a fisherman,
p21
aVI started to kind of figure out,
p22
aVwell, what was the rest of the world thinking about it?
p23
aa(lp24
VFirst place I started to look was fish markets.
p25
aVAnd when I went to fish markets,
p26
aVin spite of where I was \u2014
p27
aVwhether I was in North Carolina, or Paris, or London, or wherever \u2014
p28
aVI kept seeing this weirdly repeating trope of four creatures,
p29
aVagain and again \u2014
p30
aVon the menus, on ice \u2014
p31
aVshrimp, tuna, salmon and cod.
p32
aVAnd I thought this was pretty strange,
p33
aVand as I looked at it, I was wondering,
p34
aVdid anyone else notice this sort of shrinking of the market?
p35
aa(lp36
VWell, when I looked into it,
p37
aVI realized that people didn't look at it as their team.
p38
aVOrdinary people, the way they looked at seafood was like this.
p39
aVIt's not an unusual human characteristic
p40
aVto reduce the natural world down to very few elements.
p41
aVWe did it before, 10,000 years ago, when we came out of our caves.
p42
aVIf you look at fire pits from 10,000 years ago,
p43
aVyou'll see raccoons, you'll see, you know, wolves,
p44
aVyou'll see all kinds of different creatures.
p45
aVBut if you telescope to the age of \u2014 you know, 2,000 years ago,
p46
aVyou'll see these four mammals:
p47
aVpigs, cows, sheep and goats.
p48
aVIt's true of birds, too.
p49
aVYou look at the menus in New York City restaurants
p50
aV150 years ago, 200 years ago,
p51
aVyou'll see snipe, woodcock, grouse, dozens of ducks, dozens of geese.
p52
aVBut telescope ahead to the age of modern animal husbandry,
p53
aVand you'll see four:
p54
aVturkeys, ducks, chicken and geese.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo it makes sense that we've headed in this direction.
p57
aVBut how have we headed in this direction?
p58
aVWell ...
p59
aVfirst it's a very, very new problem.
p60
aVThis is the way we've been fishing the oceans over the last 50 years.
p61
aVWorld War II was a tremendous incentive to arm ourselves in a war against fish.
p62
aVAll of the technology that we perfected during World War II \u2014
p63
aVsonar, lightweight polymers \u2014
p64
aVall these things were redirected towards fish.
p65
aVAnd so you see this tremendous buildup in fishing capacity,
p66
aVquadrupling in the course of time,
p67
aVfrom the end of World War II to the present time.
p68
aVAnd right now that means
p69
aVwe're taking between 80 and 90 million metric tons out of the sea every year.
p70
aVThat's the equivalent of the human weight of China
p71
aVtaken out of the sea every year.
p72
aVAnd it's no coincidence that I use China as the example
p73
aVbecause China is now the largest fishing nation in the world.
p74
aa(lp75
VWell, that's only half the story.
p76
aVThe other half of the story
p77
aVis this incredible boom in fish farming and aquaculture,
p78
aVwhich is now, only in the last year or two,
p79
aVstarting to exceed the amount of wild fish that we produce.
p80
aVSo that if you add wild fish and farmed fish together,
p81
aVyou get the equivalent of two Chinas created from the ocean
p82
aVeach and every year.
p83
aVAnd again, it's not a coincidence that I use China as the example,
p84
aVbecause China, in addition to being the biggest catcher of fish,
p85
aVis also the biggest farmer of fish.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo let's look though at the four choices we are making right now.
p88
aVThe first one \u2014
p89
aVby far the most consumed seafood in America and in much of the West,
p90
aVis shrimp.
p91
aVShrimp in the wild \u2014 as a wild product \u2014
p92
aVis a terrible product.
p93
aV5, 10, 15 pounds of wild fish are regularly killed
p94
aVto bring one pound of shrimp to the market.
p95
aVThey're also incredibly fuel inefficient to bring to the market.
p96
aVIn a recent study that was produced out of Dalhousie University,
p97
aVit was found that dragging for shrimp
p98
aVis one of the most carbon-intensive ways of fishing that you can find.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo you can farm them,
p101
aVand people do farm them,
p102
aVand they farm them a lot in this very area.
p103
aVProblem is ...
p104
aVthe place where you farm shrimp is in these wild habitats \u2014
p105
aVin mangrove forests.
p106
aVNow look at those lovely roots coming down.
p107
aVThose are the things that hold soil together,
p108
aVprotect coasts, create habitats for all sorts of young fish, young shrimp,
p109
aVall sorts of things that are important to this environment.
p110
aVWell, this is what happens to a lot of coastal mangrove forests.
p111
aVWe've lost millions of acres of coastal mangroves
p112
aVover the last 30 or 40 years.
p113
aVThat rate of destruction has slowed,
p114
aVbut we're still in a major mangrove deficit.
p115
aa(lp116
VThe other thing that's going on here
p117
aVis a phenomenon that the filmmaker Mark Benjamin called "Grinding Nemo."
p118
aVThis phenomenon is very, very relevant
p119
aVto anything that you've ever seen on a tropical reef.
p120
aVBecause what's going on right now,
p121
aVwe have shrimp draggers dragging for shrimp,
p122
aVcatching a huge amount of bycatch,
p123
aVthat bycatch in turn gets ground up and turned into shrimp food.
p124
aVAnd sometimes, many of these vessels \u2014
p125
aVmanned by slaves \u2014
p126
aVare catching these so-called "trash fish,"
p127
aVfish that we would love to see on a reef,
p128
aVgrinding them up
p129
aVand turning them into shrimp feed \u2014
p130
aVan ecosystem literally eating itself and spitting out shrimp.
p131
aa(lp132
VThe next most consumed seafood in America,
p133
aVand also throughout the West,
p134
aVis tuna.
p135
aVSo tuna is this ultimate global fish.
p136
aVThese huge management areas have to be observed
p137
aVin order for tuna to be well managed.
p138
aVOur own management area,
p139
aVcalled a Regional Fisheries Management Organization,
p140
aVis called ICCAT,
p141
aVthe International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.
p142
aVThe great naturalist Carl Safina once called it,
p143
aV"The International Conspiracy to Catch all the Tunas."
p144
aVOf course we've seen incredible improvement
p145
aVin ICCAT in the last few years,
p146
aVthere is total room for improvement,
p147
aVbut it remains to be said that tuna is a global fish,
p148
aVand to manage it, we have to manage the globe.
p149
aa(lp150
VWell, we could also try to grow tuna
p151
aVbut tuna is a spectacularly bad animal for aquaculture.
p152
aVMany people don't know this but tuna are warm-blooded.
p153
aVThey can heat their bodies 20 degrees above ambient temperature,
p154
aVthey can swim at over 40 miles an hour.
p155
aVSo that pretty much eliminates
p156
aVall the advantages of farming a fish, right?
p157
aVA farmed fish is \u2014
p158
aVor a fish is cold-blooded, it doesn't move too much.
p159
aVThat's a great thing for growing protein.
p160
aVBut if you've got this crazy, wild creature
p161
aVthat swims at 40 miles an hour and heats its blood \u2014
p162
aVnot a great candidate for aquaculture.
p163
aa(lp164
VThe next creature \u2014
p165
aVmost consumed seafood in America and throughout the West \u2014
p166
aVis salmon.
p167
aVNow salmon got its plundering, too,
p168
aVbut it didn't really necessarily happen through fishing.
p169
aVThis is my home state of Connecticut.
p170
aVConnecticut used to be home to a lot of wild salmon.
p171
aVBut if you look at this map of Connecticut,
p172
aVevery dot on that map is a dam.
p173
aVThere are over 3,000 dams in the state of Connecticut.
p174
aVI often say this is why people in Connecticut are so uptight \u2014
p175
aa(lp176
V(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
VIf somebody could just unblock Connecticut's chi,
p179
aVI feel that we could have an infinitely better world.
p180
aVBut I made this particular comment
p181
aVat a convention once of national parks officers,
p182
aVand this guy from North Carolina sidled up to me, he says,
p183
aV"You know, you oughtn't be so hard on your Connecticut,
p184
aVcause we here in North Carolina, we got 35,000 dams."
p185
aVSo it's a national epidemic, it's an international epidemic.
p186
aVAnd there are dams everywhere,
p187
aVand these are precisely the things
p188
aVthat stop wild salmon from reaching their spawning grounds.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo as a result, we've turned to aquaculture,
p191
aVand salmon is one the most successful, at least from a numbers point of view.
p192
aVWhen they first started farming salmon,
p193
aVit could take as many as six pounds of wild fish
p194
aVto make a single pound of salmon.
p195
aVThe industry has, to its credit, greatly improved.
p196
aVThey've gotten it below two to one,
p197
aValthough it's a little bit of a cheat
p198
aVbecause if you look at the way aquaculture feed is produced,
p199
aVthey're measuring pellets \u2014
p200
aVpounds of pellets per pound of salmon.
p201
aVThose pellets are in turn reduced fish.
p202
aVSo the actual \u2014 what's called the FIFO, the fish in and the fish out \u2014
p203
aVkind of hard to say.
p204
aVBut in any case,
p205
aVcredit to the industry,
p206
aVit has lowered the amount of fish per pound of salmon.
p207
aa(lp208
VProblem is we've also gone crazy
p209
aVwith the amount of salmon that we're producing.
p210
aVAquaculture is the fastest growing food system on the planet.
p211
aVIt's growing at something like seven percent per year.
p212
aVAnd so even though we're doing less per fish
p213
aVto bring it to the market,
p214
aVwe're still killing a lot of these little fish.
p215
aa(lp216
VAnd it's not just fish that we're feeding fish to,
p217
aVwe're also feeding fish to chickens and pigs.
p218
aVSo we've got chickens and they're eating fish,
p219
aVbut weirdly, we also have fish that are eating chickens.
p220
aVBecause the byproducts of chickens \u2014 feathers, blood, bone \u2014
p221
aVget ground up and fed to fish.
p222
aVSo I often wonder,
p223
aVis there a fish that ate a chicken that ate a fish?
p224
aVIt's sort of a reworking of the chicken and egg thing. Anyway \u2014
p225
aa(lp226
V(Laughter)
p227
aa(lp228
VAll together, though, it results in a terrible mess.
p229
aVWhat you're talking about
p230
aVis something between 20 and 30 million metric tons of wild creatures
p231
aVthat are taken from the ocean and used and ground up.
p232
aVThat's the equivalent of a third of a China,
p233
aVor of an entire United States of humans
p234
aVthat's taken out of the sea each and every year.
p235
aa(lp236
VThe last of the four is a kind of amorphous thing.
p237
aVIt's what the industry calls "whitefish."
p238
aVThere are many fish that get cycled into this whitefish thing
p239
aVbut the way to kind of tell the story, I think,
p240
aVis through that classic piece of American culinary innovation,
p241
aVthe Filet-O-Fish sandwich.
p242
aVSo the Filet-O-Fish sandwich actually started as halibut.
p243
aVAnd it started because a local franchise owner
p244
aVfound that when he served his McDonald's on Friday, nobody came.
p245
aVBecause it was a Catholic community, they needed fish.
p246
aVSo he went to Ray Kroc and he said,
p247
aV"I'm going to bring you a fish sandwich, going to be made out of halibut."
p248
aVRay Kroc said, "I don't think it's going to work.
p249
aVI want to do a Hula Burger,
p250
aVand there's going to be a slice of pineapple on a bun.
p251
aVBut let's do this, let's have a bet.
p252
aVWhosever sandwich sells more, that will be the winning sandwich."
p253
aVWell, it's kind of sad for the ocean that the Hula Burger didn't win.
p254
aVSo he made his halibut sandwich.
p255
aVUnfortunately though, the sandwich came in at 30 cents.
p256
aVRay wanted the sandwich to come in at 25 cents,
p257
aVso he turned to Atlantic cod.
p258
aVWe all know what happened to Atlantic cod in New England.
p259
aa(lp260
VSo now the Filet-O-Fish sandwich is made out of Alaska pollock,
p261
aVit's the largest fin fish fishery in the United States,
p262
aV2 to 3 billion pounds of fish taken out of the sea every single year.
p263
aVIf we go through the pollock,
p264
aVthe next choice is probably going to be tilapia.
p265
aVTilapia is one of those fish nobody ever heard of 20 years ago.
p266
aVIt's actually a very efficient converter of plant protein into animal protein,
p267
aVand it's been a godsend to the third world.
p268
aVIt's actually a tremendously sustainable solution,
p269
aVit goes from an egg to an adult in nine months.
p270
aVThe problem is that when you look about the West,
p271
aVit doesn't do what the West wants it to do.
p272
aVIt really doesn't have what's called an oily fish profile.
p273
aVIt doesn't have the EPA and DHA omega-3s
p274
aVthat we all think are going to make us live forever.
p275
aa(lp276
VSo what do we do?
p277
aVI mean, first of all, what about this poor fish, the clupeids?
p278
aVThe fish that represent a huge part of that 20 to 30 million metric tons.
p279
aVWell, one possibility that a lot of conservationists have raised
p280
aVis could we eat them?
p281
aVCould we eat them directly instead of feeding them to salmon?
p282
aVThere are arguments for it.
p283
aVThey are tremendously fuel efficient to bring to market,
p284
aVa fraction of the fuel cost of say, shrimp,
p285
aVand at the very top of the carbon efficiency scale.
p286
aVThey also are omega-3 rich, a great source for EPA and DHA.
p287
aVSo that is a potential.
p288
aVAnd if we were to go down that route what I would say is,
p289
aVinstead of paying a few bucks a pound \u2014 or a few bucks a ton, really \u2014
p290
aVand making it into aquafeed,
p291
aVcould we halve the catch and double the price for the fishermen
p292
aVand make that our way of treating these particular fish?
p293
aa(lp294
VOther possibility though, which is much more interesting,
p295
aVis looking at bivalves, particularly mussels.
p296
aVNow, mussels are very high in EPA and DHA, they're similar to canned tuna.
p297
aVThey're also extremely fuel efficient.
p298
aVTo bring a pound of mussels to market
p299
aVis about a thirtieth of the carbon as required to bring beef to market.
p300
aVThey require no forage fish,
p301
aVthey actually get their omega-3s by filtering the water of microalgae.
p302
aVIn fact, that's where omega-3s come from, they don't come from fish.
p303
aVMicroalgae make the omega-3s, they're only bioconcentrated in fish.
p304
aa(lp305
VMussels and other bivalves
p306
aVdo tremendous amounts of water filtration.
p307
aVA single mussel can filter dozens of gallons every single day.
p308
aVAnd this is incredibly important when we look at the world.
p309
aVRight now, nitrification, overuse of phosphates in our waterways
p310
aVare causing tremendous algal blooms.
p311
aVOver 400 new dead zones have been created in the last 20 years,
p312
aVtremendous sources of marine life death.
p313
aa(lp314
VWe also could look at not a fish at all.
p315
aVWe could look at a vegetable.
p316
aVWe could look at seaweed, the kelps,
p317
aVall these different varieties of things that can be high in omega-3s,
p318
aVcan be high in proteins,
p319
aVtremendously good things.
p320
aVThey filter the water just like mussels do.
p321
aVAnd weirdly enough,
p322
aVit turns out that you can actually feed this to cows.
p323
aVNow, I'm not a big fan of cattle.
p324
aVBut if you wanted to keep growing cattle
p325
aVin a time and place where water resources are limited,
p326
aVyou're growing seaweed in the water, you don't have to water it \u2014
p327
aVmajor consideration.
p328
aa(lp329
VAnd the last fish is a question mark.
p330
aVWe have the ability to create aquacultured fish
p331
aVthat creates a net gain of marine protein for us.
p332
aVThis creature would have to be vegetarian,
p333
aVit would have to be fast growing,
p334
aVit would have to be adaptable to a changing climate
p335
aVand it would have to have that oily fish profile,
p336
aVthat EPA, DHA, omega-3 fatty acid profile that we're looking for.
p337
aa(lp338
VThis exists kind of on paper.
p339
aVI have been reporting on these subjects for 15 years.
p340
aVEvery time I do a new story, somebody tells me,
p341
aV"We can do all that. We can do it. We've figured it all out.
p342
aVWe can produce a fish
p343
aVthat's a net gain of marine protein and has omega-3s."
p344
aVGreat.
p345
aVIt doesn't seem to be getting scaled up.
p346
aVIt is time to scale this up.
p347
aVIf we do,
p348
aV30 million metric tons of seafood, a third of the world catch,
p349
aVstays in the water.
p350
aa(lp351
VSo I guess what I'm saying is this is what we've been going with.
p352
aVWe tend to go with our appetites rather than our minds.
p353
aVBut if we went with this, or some configuration of it,
p354
aVwe might have a little more of this.
p355
aa(lp356
VThank you.

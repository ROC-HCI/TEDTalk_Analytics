VI once said,
p5
aV"If you want to liberate a society,
p6
aVall you need is the Internet."
p7
aVI was wrong.
p8
aa(lp9
VI said those words back in 2011,
p10
aVwhen a Facebook page I anonymously created
p11
aVhelped spark the Egyptian revolution.
p12
aVThe Arab Spring revealed social media's greatest potential,
p13
aVbut it also exposed its greatest shortcomings.
p14
aVThe same tool that united us to topple dictators
p15
aVeventually tore us apart.
p16
aVI would like to share my own experience in using social media for activism,
p17
aVand talk about some of the challenges I have personally faced
p18
aVand what we could do about them.
p19
aa(lp20
VIn the early 2000s,
p21
aVArabs were flooding the web.
p22
aVThirsty for knowledge, for opportunities,
p23
aVfor connecting with the rest of the people around the globe,
p24
aVwe escaped our frustrating political realities
p25
aVand lived a virtual, alternative life.
p26
aVJust like many of them, I was completely apolitical until 2009.
p27
aVAt the time, when I logged into social media,
p28
aVI started seeing more and more Egyptians
p29
aVaspiring for political change in the country.
p30
aVIt felt like I was not alone.
p31
aa(lp32
VIn June 2010,
p33
aVInternet changed my life forever.
p34
aVWhile browsing Facebook,
p35
aVI saw a photo, a terrifying photo, of a tortured, dead body
p36
aVof a young Egyptian guy.
p37
aVHis name was Khaled Said.
p38
aVKhaled was a 29-year-old Alexandrian who was killed by police.
p39
aVI saw myself in his picture.
p40
aVI thought, "I could be Khaled."
p41
aa(lp42
VI could not sleep that night, and I decided to do something.
p43
aVI anonymously created a Facebook page
p44
aVand called it "We are all Khaled Said."
p45
aVIn just three days, the page had over 100,000 people,
p46
aVfellow Egyptians who shared the same concern.
p47
aVWhatever was happening had to stop.
p48
aa(lp49
VI recruited my co-admin, AbdelRahman Mansour.
p50
aVWe worked together for hours and hours.
p51
aVWe were crowdsourcing ideas from the people.
p52
aVWe were engaging them.
p53
aVWe were calling collectively for actions,
p54
aVand sharing news that the regime did not want Egyptians to know.
p55
aVThe page became the most followed page
p56
aVin the Arab world.
p57
aVIt had more fans than established media organizations
p58
aVand even top celebrities.
p59
aa(lp60
VOn January 14, 2011,
p61
aVBen Ali fled out of Tunisia
p62
aVafter mounting protests against his regime.
p63
aVI saw a spark of hope.
p64
aVEgyptians on social media were wondering,
p65
aV"If Tunisia did it, why can't we?"
p66
aVI posted an event on Facebook and called it
p67
aV"A Revolution against Corruption, Injustice and Dictatorship."
p68
aVI posed a question to the 300,000 users of the page at the time:
p69
aV"Today is the 14th of January.
p70
aVThe 25th of January is Police Day.
p71
aVIt's a national holiday.
p72
aVIf 100,000 of us take to the streets of Cairo,
p73
aVno one is going to stop us.
p74
aVI wonder if we could do it."
p75
aa(lp76
VIn just a few days, the invitation reached over a million people,
p77
aVand over 100,000 people confirmed attendance.
p78
aVSocial media was crucial for this campaign.
p79
aVIt helped a decentralized movement arise.
p80
aVIt made people realize that they were not alone.
p81
aVAnd it made it impossible for the regime to stop it.
p82
aVAt the time, they didn't even understand it.
p83
aVAnd on January 25th, Egyptians flooded the streets of Cairo and other cities,
p84
aVcalling for change,
p85
aVbreaking the barrier of fear
p86
aVand announcing a new era.
p87
aa(lp88
VThen came the consequences.
p89
aVA few hours before the regime cut off the Internet and telecommunications,
p90
aVI was walking in a dark street in Cairo, around midnight.
p91
aVI had just tweeted, "Pray for Egypt.
p92
aVThe government must be planning a massacre tomorrow."
p93
aa(lp94
VI was hit hard on my head.
p95
aVI lost my balance and fell down,
p96
aVto find four armed men surrounding me.
p97
aVOne covered my mouth and the others paralyzed me.
p98
aVI knew I was being kidnapped by state security.
p99
aa(lp100
VI found myself in a cell,
p101
aVhandcuffed, blindfolded.
p102
aVI was terrified.
p103
aVSo was my family,
p104
aVwho started looking for me
p105
aVin hospitals, police stations and even morgues.
p106
aa(lp107
VAfter my disappearance,
p108
aVa few of my fellow colleagues who knew I was the admin of the page
p109
aVtold the media about my connection with that page,
p110
aVand that I was likely arrested by state security.
p111
aVMy colleagues at Google started a search campaign trying to find me,
p112
aVand the fellow protesters in the square demanded my release.
p113
aa(lp114
VAfter 11 days of complete darkness,
p115
aVI was set free.
p116
aVAnd three days later,
p117
aVMubarak was forced to step down.
p118
aVIt was the most inspiring and empowering moment of my life.
p119
aVIt was a time of great hope.
p120
aVEgyptians lived a utopia for 18 days during the revolution.
p121
aVThey all shared the belief
p122
aVthat we could actually live together despite our differences,
p123
aVthat Egypt after Mubarak would be for all.
p124
aa(lp125
VBut unfortunately,
p126
aVthe post-revolution events were like a punch in the gut.
p127
aVThe euphoria faded,
p128
aVwe failed to build consensus,
p129
aVand the political struggle led to intense polarization.
p130
aVSocial media only amplified that state,
p131
aVby facilitating the spread of misinformation, rumors,
p132
aVecho chambers and hate speech.
p133
aVThe environment was purely toxic.
p134
aVMy online world became a battleground filled with trolls, lies, hate speech.
p135
aVI started to worry about the safety of my family.
p136
aVBut of course, this wasn't just about me.
p137
aVThe polarization reached its peak between the two main powers \u2014
p138
aVthe army supporters and the Islamists.
p139
aVPeople in the center, like me,
p140
aVstarted feeling helpless.
p141
aVBoth groups wanted you to side with them;
p142
aVyou were either with them or against them.
p143
aVAnd on the 3rd of July 2013,
p144
aVthe army ousted Egypt's first democratically elected president,
p145
aVafter three days of popular protest that demanded his resignation.
p146
aa(lp147
VThat day I made a very hard decision.
p148
aVI decided to go silent, completely silent.
p149
aVIt was a moment of defeat.
p150
aVI stayed silent for more than two years,
p151
aVand I used the time to reflect on everything that happened,
p152
aVtrying to understand why did it happen.
p153
aVIt became clear to me
p154
aVthat while it's true that polarization is primarily driven
p155
aVby our human behavior,
p156
aVsocial media shapes this behavior and magnifies its impact.
p157
aVSay you want to say something that is not based on a fact,
p158
aVpick a fight or ignore someone that you don't like.
p159
aVThese are all natural human impulses,
p160
aVbut because of technology,
p161
aVacting on these impulses is only one click away.
p162
aa(lp163
VIn my view, there are five critical challenges
p164
aVfacing today's social media.
p165
aa(lp166
VFirst, we don't know how to deal with rumors.
p167
aVRumors that confirm people's biases
p168
aVare now believed and spread among millions of people.
p169
aa(lp170
VSecond, we create our own echo chambers.
p171
aVWe tend to only communicate with people that we agree with,
p172
aVand thanks to social media,
p173
aVwe can mute, un-follow and block everybody else.
p174
aa(lp175
VThird, online discussions quickly descend into angry mobs.
p176
aVAll of us probably know that.
p177
aVIt's as if we forget
p178
aVthat the people behind screens are actually real people
p179
aVand not just avatars.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd fourth, it became really hard to change our opinions.
p182
aVBecause of the speed and brevity of social media,
p183
aVwe are forced to jump to conclusions
p184
aVand write sharp opinions in 140 characters
p185
aVabout complex world affairs.
p186
aVAnd once we do that, it lives forever on the Internet,
p187
aVand we are less motivated to change these views,
p188
aVeven when new evidence arises.
p189
aa(lp190
VFifth \u2014 and in my point of view, this is the most critical \u2014
p191
aVtoday, our social media experiences are designed in a way
p192
aVthat favors broadcasting over engagements,
p193
aVposts over discussions,
p194
aVshallow comments over deep conversations.
p195
aVIt's as if we agreed that we are here to talk at each other
p196
aVinstead of talking with each other.
p197
aa(lp198
VI witnessed how these critical challenges contributed
p199
aVto an already polarized Egyptian society,
p200
aVbut this is not just about Egypt.
p201
aVPolarization is on the rise in the whole world.
p202
aVWe need to work hard on figuring out
p203
aVhow technology could be part of the solution,
p204
aVrather than part of the problem.
p205
aa(lp206
VThere's a lot of debate today on how to combat online harassment
p207
aVand fight trolls.
p208
aVThis is so important.
p209
aVNo one could argue against that.
p210
aVBut we need to also think about how to design social media experiences
p211
aVthat promote civility and reward thoughtfulness.
p212
aVI know for a fact
p213
aVif I write a post that is more sensational,
p214
aVmore one-sided, sometimes angry and aggressive,
p215
aVI get to have more people see that post.
p216
aVI will get more attention.
p217
aa(lp218
VBut what if we put more focus on quality?
p219
aVWhat is more important:
p220
aVthe total number of readers of a post you write,
p221
aVor who are the people who have impact that read what you write?
p222
aVCouldn't we just give people more incentives to engage in conversations,
p223
aVrather than just broadcasting opinions all the time?
p224
aVOr reward people for reading
p225
aVand responding to views that they disagree with?
p226
aVAnd also, make it socially acceptable that we change our minds,
p227
aVor probably even reward that?
p228
aVWhat if we have a matrix that says how many people changed their minds,
p229
aVand that becomes part of our social media experience?
p230
aVIf I could track how many people are changing their minds,
p231
aVI'd probably write more thoughtfully, trying to do that,
p232
aVrather than appealing to the people who already agree with me
p233
aVand "liking" because I just confirmed their biases.
p234
aa(lp235
VWe also need to think about effective crowdsourcing mechanisms,
p236
aVto fact-check widely spread online information,
p237
aVand reward people who take part in that.
p238
aVIn essence, we need to rethink today's social media ecosystem
p239
aVand redesign its experiences
p240
aVto reward thoughtfulness, civility and mutual understanding.
p241
aa(lp242
VAs a believer in the Internet, I teamed up with a few friends,
p243
aVstarted a new project,
p244
aVtrying to find answers and explore possibilities.
p245
aVOur first product is a new media platform for conversations.
p246
aVWe're hosting conversations that promote mutual understanding
p247
aVand hopefully change minds.
p248
aVWe don't claim to have the answers,
p249
aVbut we started experimenting with different discussions
p250
aVabout very divisive issues,
p251
aVsuch as race, gun control, the refugee debate,
p252
aVrelationship between Islam and terrorism.
p253
aVThese are conversations that matter.
p254
aa(lp255
VToday, at least one out of three people on the planet
p256
aVhave access to the Internet.
p257
aVBut part of this Internet is being held captive
p258
aVby the less noble aspects of our human behavior.
p259
aa(lp260
VFive years ago, I said,
p261
aV"If you want to liberate society,
p262
aVall you need is the Internet."
p263
aa(lp264
VToday, I believe if we want to liberate society,
p265
aVwe first need to liberate the Internet.
p266
aa(lp267
VThank you very much.
p268
aa(lp269
V(Applause)

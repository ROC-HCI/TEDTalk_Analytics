VMany times
p5
aVI go around the world to speak,
p6
aVand people ask me questions
p7
aVabout the challenges,
p8
aVmy moments,
p9
aVsome of my regrets.
p10
aV1998:
p11
aVA single mother of four,
p12
aVthree months after the birth of my fourth child,
p13
aVI went to do a job
p14
aVas a research assistant.
p15
aVI went to Northern Liberia.
p16
aVAnd as part of the work,
p17
aVthe village would give you lodgings.
p18
aVAnd they gave me lodging with a single mother
p19
aVand her daughter.
p20
aa(lp21
VThis girl happened to be
p22
aVthe only girl in the entire village
p23
aVwho had made it
p24
aVto the ninth grade.
p25
aVShe was the laughing stock of the community.
p26
aVHer mother was often told by other women,
p27
aV"You and your child
p28
aVwill die poor."
p29
aVAfter two weeks of working in that village,
p30
aVit was time to go back.
p31
aVThe mother came to me, knelt down,
p32
aVand said, "Leymah, take my daughter.
p33
aVI wish for her
p34
aVto be a nurse."
p35
aVDirt poor, living in the home with my parents,
p36
aVI couldn't afford to.
p37
aVWith tears in my eyes,
p38
aVI said, "No."
p39
aa(lp40
VTwo months later,
p41
aVI go to another village
p42
aVon the same assignment
p43
aVand they asked me to live with the village chief.
p44
aVThe women's chief of the village has this little girl,
p45
aVfair color like me,
p46
aVtotally dirty.
p47
aVAnd all day she walked around
p48
aVonly in her underwear.
p49
aVWhen I asked, "Who is that?"
p50
aVShe said, "That's Wei.
p51
aVThe meaning of her name is pig.
p52
aVHer mother died while giving birth to her,
p53
aVand no one had any idea who her father was."
p54
aVFor two weeks, she became my companion,
p55
aVslept with me.
p56
aVI bought her used clothes
p57
aVand bought her her first doll.
p58
aVThe night before I left,
p59
aVshe came to the room
p60
aVand said, "Leymah, don't leave me here.
p61
aVI wish to go with you.
p62
aVI wish to go to school."
p63
aVDirt poor, no money,
p64
aVliving with my parents,
p65
aVI again said, "No."
p66
aVTwo months later,
p67
aVboth of those villages fell into another war.
p68
aVTill today, I have no idea
p69
aVwhere those two girls are.
p70
aa(lp71
VFast-forward, 2004:
p72
aVIn the peak of our activism,
p73
aVthe minister of Gender Liberia called me
p74
aVand said, "Leymah, I have a nine-year-old for you.
p75
aVI want you to bring her home
p76
aVbecause we don't have safe homes."
p77
aVThe story of this little girl:
p78
aVShe had been raped
p79
aVby her paternal grandfather
p80
aVevery day for six months.
p81
aVShe came to me bloated,
p82
aVvery pale.
p83
aVEvery night I'd come from work and lie on the cold floor.
p84
aVShe'd lie beside me
p85
aVand say, "Auntie, I wish to be well.
p86
aVI wish to go to school."
p87
aa(lp88
V2010:
p89
aVA young woman stands before President Sirleaf
p90
aVand gives her testimony
p91
aVof how she and her siblings live together,
p92
aVtheir father and mother died during the war.
p93
aVShe's 19; her dream is to go to college
p94
aVto be able to support them.
p95
aVShe's highly athletic.
p96
aVOne of the things that happens
p97
aVis that she applies for a scholarship.
p98
aVFull scholarship. She gets it.
p99
aVHer dream of going to school,
p100
aVher wish of being educated,
p101
aVis finally here.
p102
aVShe goes to school on the first day.
p103
aVThe director of sports
p104
aVwho's responsible for getting her into the program
p105
aVasks her to come out of class.
p106
aVAnd for the next three years,
p107
aVher fate will be
p108
aVhaving sex with him every day,
p109
aVas a favor for getting her in school.
p110
aa(lp111
VGlobally, we have policies,
p112
aVinternational instruments,
p113
aVwork leaders.
p114
aVGreat people have made commitments \u2014
p115
aVwe will protect our children
p116
aVfrom want and from fear.
p117
aVThe U.N. has the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
p118
aVCountries like America, we've heard things like No Child Left Behind.
p119
aVOther countries come with different things.
p120
aVThere is a Millennium Development called Three
p121
aVthat focuses on girls.
p122
aVAll of these great works by great people
p123
aVaimed at getting young people
p124
aVto where we want to get them globally,
p125
aVI think, has failed.
p126
aa(lp127
VIn Liberia, for example,
p128
aVthe teenage pregnancy rate
p129
aVis three to every 10 girls.
p130
aVTeen prostitution is at its peak.
p131
aVIn one community, we're told,
p132
aVyou wake up in the morning
p133
aVand see used condoms like used chewing gum paper.
p134
aVGirls as young as 12 being prostituted
p135
aVfor less than a dollar a night.
p136
aVIt's disheartening, it's sad.
p137
aVAnd then someone asked me,
p138
aVjust before my TEDTalk, a few days ago,
p139
aV"So where is the hope?"
p140
aa(lp141
VSeveral years ago, a few friends of mine
p142
aVdecided we needed to bridge the disconnect
p143
aVbetween our generation
p144
aVand the generation of young women.
p145
aVIt's not enough to say
p146
aVyou have two Nobel laureates from the Republic of Liberia
p147
aVwhen your girls' kids are totally out there
p148
aVand no hope, or seemingly no hope.
p149
aVWe created a space
p150
aVcalled the Young Girls Transformative Project.
p151
aVWe go into rural communities
p152
aVand all we do, like has been done in this room,
p153
aVis create the space.
p154
aVWhen these girls sit,
p155
aVyou unlock intelligence,
p156
aVyou unlock passion,
p157
aVyou unlock commitment,
p158
aVyou unlock focus,
p159
aVyou unlock great leaders.
p160
aVToday, we've worked with over 300.
p161
aVAnd some of those girls
p162
aVwho walked in the room very shy
p163
aVhave taken bold steps, as young mothers,
p164
aVto go out there and advocate
p165
aVfor the rights of other young women.
p166
aa(lp167
VOne young woman I met,
p168
aVteen mother of four,
p169
aVnever thought about finishing high school,
p170
aVgraduated successfully;
p171
aVnever thought about going to college,
p172
aVenrolled in college.
p173
aVOne day she said to me,
p174
aV"My wish is to finish college
p175
aVand be able to support my children."
p176
aVShe's at a place where she can't find money
p177
aVto go to school.
p178
aVShe sells water, sells soft drinks
p179
aVand sells recharge cards for cellphones.
p180
aVAnd you would think she would take that money
p181
aVand put it back into her education.
p182
aVJuanita is her name.
p183
aVShe takes that money
p184
aVand finds single mothers in her community
p185
aVto send back to school.
p186
aVSays, "Leymah, my wish
p187
aVis to be educated.
p188
aVAnd if I can't be educated,
p189
aVwhen I see some of my sisters being educated,
p190
aVmy wish has been fulfilled.
p191
aVI wish for a better life.
p192
aVI wish for food for my children.
p193
aVI wish that sexual abuse and exploitation in schools would stop."
p194
aVThis is the dream of the African girl.
p195
aa(lp196
VSeveral years ago,
p197
aVthere was one African girl.
p198
aVThis girl had a son
p199
aVwho wished for a piece of doughnut
p200
aVbecause he was extremely hungry.
p201
aVAngry, frustrated,
p202
aVreally upset
p203
aVabout the state of her society
p204
aVand the state of her children,
p205
aVthis young girl started a movement,
p206
aVa movement of ordinary women
p207
aVbanding together
p208
aVto build peace.
p209
aVI will fulfill the wish.
p210
aVThis is another African girl's wish.
p211
aVI failed to fulfill the wish of those two girls.
p212
aVI failed to do this.
p213
aVThese were the things that were going through the head of this other young woman \u2014
p214
aVI failed, I failed, I failed.
p215
aVSo I will do this.
p216
aVWomen came out,
p217
aVprotested a brutal dictator,
p218
aVfearlessly spoke.
p219
aVNot only did the wish of a piece of doughnut come true,
p220
aVthe wish of peace came true.
p221
aVThis young woman
p222
aVwished also to go to school.
p223
aVShe went to school.
p224
aVThis young woman wished for other things to happen,
p225
aVit happened for her.
p226
aa(lp227
VToday, this young woman is me,
p228
aVa Nobel laureate.
p229
aVI'm now on a journey
p230
aVto fulfill the wish,
p231
aVin my tiny capacity,
p232
aVof little African girls \u2014
p233
aVthe wish of being educated.
p234
aVWe set up a foundation.
p235
aVWe're giving full four-year scholarships
p236
aVto girls from villages that we see with potential.
p237
aa(lp238
VI don't have much to ask of you.
p239
aVI've also been to places in this U.S.,
p240
aVand I know that girls in this country
p241
aValso have wishes,
p242
aVa wish for a better life somewhere in the Bronx,
p243
aVa wish for a better life
p244
aVsomewhere in downtown L.A.,
p245
aVa wish for a better life somewhere in Texas,
p246
aVa wish for a better life somewhere in New York,
p247
aVa wish for a better life
p248
aVsomewhere in New Jersey.
p249
aa(lp250
VWill you journey with me
p251
aVto help that girl,
p252
aVbe it an African girl or an American girl
p253
aVor a Japanese girl,
p254
aVfulfill her wish,
p255
aVfulfill her dream,
p256
aVachieve that dream?
p257
aVBecause all of these
p258
aVgreat innovators and inventors
p259
aVthat we've talked to and seen
p260
aVover the last few days
p261
aVare also sitting in tiny corners
p262
aVin different parts of the world,
p263
aVand all they're asking us to do
p264
aVis create that space
p265
aVto unlock the intelligence,
p266
aVunlock the passion,
p267
aVunlock all of the great things
p268
aVthat they hold within themselves.
p269
aVLet's journey together. Let's journey together.
p270
aa(lp271
VThank you.
p272
aa(lp273
V(Applause)
p274
aa(lp275
VChris Anderson: Thank you so much.
p276
aVRight now in Liberia,
p277
aVwhat do you see
p278
aVas the main issue that troubles you?
p279
aa(lp280
VLG: I've been asked to lead
p281
aVthe Liberian Reconciliation Initiative.
p282
aVAs part of my work,
p283
aVI'm doing these tours
p284
aVin different villages and towns \u2014
p285
aV13, 15 hours on dirt roads \u2014
p286
aVand there is no community that I've gone into
p287
aVthat I haven't seen intelligent girls.
p288
aVBut sadly,
p289
aVthe vision of a great future,
p290
aVor the dream of a great future,
p291
aVis just a dream,
p292
aVbecause you have all of these vices.
p293
aVTeen pregnancy, like I said, is epidemic.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo what troubles me
p296
aVis that I was at that place
p297
aVand somehow I'm at this place,
p298
aVand I just don't want to be the only one
p299
aVat this place.
p300
aVI'm looking for ways
p301
aVfor other girls to be with me.
p302
aVI want to look back 20 years from now
p303
aVand see that there's another Liberian girl,
p304
aVGhanaian girl, Nigerian girl, Ethiopian girl
p305
aVstanding on this TED stage.
p306
aVAnd maybe, just maybe, saying,
p307
aV"Because of that Nobel laureate
p308
aVI'm here today."
p309
aVSo I'm troubled
p310
aVwhen I see them like there's no hope.
p311
aVBut I'm also not pessimistic,
p312
aVbecause I know it doesn't take a lot
p313
aVto get them charged up.
p314
aa(lp315
VCA: And in the last year,
p316
aVtell us one hopeful thing
p317
aVthat you've seen happening.
p318
aa(lp319
VLG: I can tell you many hopeful things that I've seen happening.
p320
aVBut in the last year,
p321
aVwhere President Sirleaf comes from, her village,
p322
aVwe went there to work with these girls.
p323
aVAnd we could not find 25 girls
p324
aVin high school.
p325
aVAll of these girls went to the gold mine,
p326
aVand they were predominantly prostitutes
p327
aVdoing other things.
p328
aVWe took 50 of those girls
p329
aVand we worked with them.
p330
aVAnd this was at the beginning of elections.
p331
aVThis is one place where women were never \u2014
p332
aVeven the older ones
p333
aVbarely sat in the circle with the men.
p334
aVThese girls banded together and formed a group
p335
aVand launched a campaign
p336
aVfor voter registration.
p337
aVThis is a real rural village.
p338
aVAnd the theme they used was:
p339
aV"Even pretty girls vote."
p340
aVThey were able to mobilize young women.
p341
aa(lp342
VBut not only did they do that,
p343
aVthey went to those who were running for seats
p344
aVto ask them, "What is it
p345
aVthat you will give the girls of this community
p346
aVwhen you win?"
p347
aVAnd one of the guys
p348
aVwho already had a seat was very \u2014
p349
aVbecause Liberia has one of the strongest rape laws,
p350
aVand he was one of those really fighting in parliament
p351
aVto overturn that law
p352
aVbecause he called it barbaric.
p353
aVRape is not barbaric, but the law, he said, was barbaric.
p354
aVAnd when the girls started engaging him,
p355
aVhe was very hostile towards them.
p356
aVThese little girls turned to him and said,
p357
aV"We will vote you out of office."
p358
aVHe's out of office today.
p359
aa(lp360
V(Applause)
p361
aa(lp362
VCA: Leymah, thank you. Thank you so much for coming to TED.
p363
aa(lp364
VLG: You're welcome. (CA: Thank you.)

VI'm going to talk about the power of a word:
p5
aVjihad.
p6
aa(lp7
VTo the vast majority of practicing Muslims,
p8
aVjihad is an internal struggle for the faith.
p9
aVIt is a struggle within, a struggle against vice, sin,
p10
aVtemptation, lust, greed.
p11
aVIt is a struggle to try and live a life
p12
aVthat is set by the moral codes written in the Koran.
p13
aVIn that original idea, the concept of jihad is as important
p14
aVto Muslims as the idea of grace is to Christians.
p15
aVIt's a very powerful word, jihad, if you look at it in that respect,
p16
aVand there's a certain almost mystical resonance to it.
p17
aVAnd that's the reason why, for hundreds of years,
p18
aVMuslims everywhere have named their children Jihad,
p19
aVtheir daughters as much as their sons, in the same way
p20
aVthat, say, Christians name their daughters Grace,
p21
aVand Hindus, my people, name our daughters Bhakti,
p22
aVwhich means, in Sanskrit, spiritual worship.
p23
aa(lp24
VBut there have always been, in Islam, a small group,
p25
aVa minority, who believe that jihad
p26
aVis not only an internal struggle but also an external struggle
p27
aVagainst forces that would threaten the faith, or the faithul.
p28
aVAnd some of these people believe that in that struggle,
p29
aVit is sometimes okay to take up arms.
p30
aVAnd so the thousands of young Muslim men
p31
aVwho flocked to Afghanistan in the 1980s
p32
aVto fight against the Soviet occupation of a Muslim country,
p33
aVin their minds they were fighting a jihad,
p34
aVthey were doing jihad,
p35
aVand they named themselves the Mujahideen,
p36
aVwhich is a word that comes from the same root as jihad.
p37
aVAnd we forget this now, but back then
p38
aVthe Mujahideen were celebrated in this country, in America.
p39
aVWe thought of them as holy warriors who were taking
p40
aVthe good fight to the ungodly communists.
p41
aVAmerica gave them weapons, gave them money,
p42
aVgave them support, encouragement.
p43
aa(lp44
VBut within that group, a tiny, smaller group,
p45
aVa minority within a minority within a minority,
p46
aVwere coming up with a new and dangerous
p47
aVconception of jihad,
p48
aVand in time this group would come to be led by Osama bin Laden,
p49
aVand he refined the idea.
p50
aVHis idea of jihad was a global war of terror,
p51
aVprimarily targeted at the far enemy,
p52
aVat the crusaders from the West, against America.
p53
aVAnd the things he did in the pursuit of this jihad
p54
aVwere so horrendous, so monstrous,
p55
aVand had such great impact,
p56
aVthat his definition was the one that stuck,
p57
aVnot just here in the West.
p58
aVWe didn't know any better. We didn't pause to ask.
p59
aVWe just assumed that if this insane man and his psychopathic followers
p60
aVwere calling what they did jihad, then that's what jihad must mean.
p61
aVBut it wasn't just us. Even in the Muslim world,
p62
aVhis definition of jihad began to gain acceptance.
p63
aa(lp64
VA year ago I was in Tunis, and I met the imam
p65
aVof a very small mosque, an old man.
p66
aVFifteen years ago, he named his granddaughter Jihad,
p67
aVafter the old meaning. He hoped that a name like that
p68
aVwould inspire her to live a spiritual life.
p69
aVBut he told me that after 9/11,
p70
aVhe began to have second thoughts.
p71
aVHe worried that if he called her by that name,
p72
aVespecially outdoors, outside in public,
p73
aVhe might be seen as endorsing bin Laden's idea of jihad.
p74
aVOn Fridays in his mosque, he gave sermons
p75
aVtrying to reclaim the meaning of the word,
p76
aVbut his congregants, the people who came to his mosque,
p77
aVthey had seen the videos. They had seen pictures
p78
aVof the planes going into the towers, the towers coming down.
p79
aVThey had heard bin Laden say that that was jihad,
p80
aVand claimed victory for it. And so the old imam worried
p81
aVthat his words were falling on deaf ears. No one was paying attention.
p82
aa(lp83
VHe was wrong. Some people were paying attention,
p84
aVbut for the wrong reasons.
p85
aVThe United States, at this point, was putting pressure
p86
aVon all its Arab allies, including Tunisia,
p87
aVto stamp out extremism in their societies,
p88
aVand this imam found himself suddenly in the crosshairs
p89
aVof the Tunisian intelligence service.
p90
aVThey had never paid him any attention before \u2014
p91
aVold man, small mosque \u2014
p92
aVbut now they began to pay visits,
p93
aVand sometimes they would drag him in for questions,
p94
aVand always the same question:
p95
aV"Why did you name your granddaughter Jihad?
p96
aVWhy do you keep using the word jihad in your Friday sermons?
p97
aVDo you hate Americans?
p98
aVWhat is your connection to Osama bin Laden?"
p99
aa(lp100
VSo to the Tunisian intelligence agency,
p101
aVand organizations like it all over the Arab world,
p102
aVjihad equaled extremism,
p103
aVBin Laden's definition had become institutionalized.
p104
aVThat was the power of that word that he was able to do.
p105
aVAnd it filled this old imam, it filled him with great sadness.
p106
aVHe told me that, of bin Laden's many crimes, this was,
p107
aVin his mind, one that didn't get enough attention,
p108
aVthat he took this word, this beautiful idea.
p109
aVHe didn't so much appropriate it as kidnapped it
p110
aVand debased it and corrupted it
p111
aVand turned it into something it was never meant to be,
p112
aVand then persuaded all of us that it always was
p113
aVa global jihad.
p114
aa(lp115
VBut the good news is
p116
aVthat the global jihad is almost over, as bin Laden defined it.
p117
aVIt was dying well before he did,
p118
aVand now it's on its last legs.
p119
aVOpinion polls from all over the Muslim world show
p120
aVthat there is very little interest among Muslims
p121
aVin a global holy war against the West,
p122
aVagainst the far enemy.
p123
aVThe supply of young men willing to fight and die for this cause is dwindling.
p124
aVThe supply of money \u2014 just as important, more important perhaps \u2014
p125
aVthe supply of money to this activity is also dwindling.
p126
aVThe wealthy fanatics who were previously
p127
aVsponsoring this kind of activity are now less generous.
p128
aa(lp129
VWhat does that mean for us in the West?
p130
aVDoes it mean we can break out the champagne,
p131
aVwash our hands of it, disengage, sleep easy at night?
p132
aVNo. Disengagement is not an option,
p133
aVbecause if you let local jihad survive,
p134
aVit becomes international jihad.
p135
aVAnd so there's now a lot of different
p136
aVviolent jihads all over the world.
p137
aVIn Somalia, in Mali, in Nigeria,
p138
aVin Iraq, in Afghanistan, Pakistan, there are groups that claim
p139
aVto be the inheritors of the legacy of Osama bin Laden.
p140
aVThey use his rhetoric.
p141
aVThey even use the brand name he created for his jihad.
p142
aVSo there is now an al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb,
p143
aVthere's an al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula,
p144
aVthere is an al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.
p145
aVThere are other groups \u2014 in Nigeria, Boko Haram,
p146
aVin Somalia, al Shabaab \u2014 and they all pay homage to Osama bin Laden.
p147
aVBut if you look closely,
p148
aVthey're not fighting a global jihad.
p149
aVThey're fighting battles over much narrower issues.
p150
aVUsually it has to do with ethnicity or race or sectarianism,
p151
aVor it's a power struggle.
p152
aVMore often than not, it's a power struggle
p153
aVin one country, or even a small region within one country.
p154
aVOccasionally they will go across a border,
p155
aVfrom Iraq to Syria, from Mali to Algeria,
p156
aVfrom Somalia to Kenya, but they're not fighting
p157
aVa global jihad against some far enemy.
p158
aa(lp159
VBut that doesn't mean
p160
aVthat we can relax.
p161
aVI was in Yemen recently, where \u2014 it's the home
p162
aVof the last al Qaeda franchise
p163
aVthat still aspires to attack America, attack the West.
p164
aVIt's old school al Qaeda.
p165
aVYou may remember these guys.
p166
aVThey are the ones who tried to send the underwear bomber here,
p167
aVand they were using the Internet to try and instigate
p168
aVviolence among American Muslims.
p169
aVBut they have been distracted recently.
p170
aVLast year, they took control over a portion of southern Yemen,
p171
aVand ran it, Taliban-style.
p172
aVAnd then the Yemeni military got its act together,
p173
aVand ordinary people rose up against these guys
p174
aVand drove them out, and since then, most of their activities,
p175
aVmost of their attacks have been directed at Yemenis.
p176
aa(lp177
VSo I think we've come to a point now where we can say
p178
aVthat, just like all politics, all jihad is local.
p179
aVBut that's still not reason for us to disengage,
p180
aVbecause we've seen that movie before, in Afghanistan.
p181
aVWhen those Mujahideen defeated the Soviet Union,
p182
aVwe disengaged.
p183
aVAnd even before the fizz had gone out of our celebratory champagne,
p184
aVthe Taliban had taken over in Kabul,
p185
aVand we said, "Local jihad, not our problem."
p186
aVAnd then the Taliban gave the keys of Kandahar
p187
aVto Osama bin Laden. He made it our problem.
p188
aVLocal jihad, if you ignore it, becomes global jihad again.
p189
aa(lp190
VThe good news is that it doesn't have to be.
p191
aVWe know how to fight it now.
p192
aVWe have the tools. We have the knowhow,
p193
aVand we can take the lessons we've learned
p194
aVfrom the fight against global jihad, the victory against global jihad,
p195
aVand apply those to local jihad.
p196
aa(lp197
VWhat are those lessons? We know who killed bin Laden:
p198
aVSEAL Team Six.
p199
aVDo we know, do we understand, who killed bin Ladenism?
p200
aVWho ended the global jihad?
p201
aVThere lie the answers to the solution to local jihad.
p202
aa(lp203
VWho killed bin Ladenism? Let's start with bin Laden himself.
p204
aVHe probably thought 9/11 was his greatest achievement.
p205
aVIn reality, it was the beginning of the end for him.
p206
aVHe killed 3,000 innocent people, and that filled
p207
aVthe Muslim world with horror and revulsion,
p208
aVand what that meant was that his idea of jihad
p209
aVcould never become mainstream.
p210
aVHe condemned himself to operating on the lunatic fringes
p211
aVof his own community.
p212
aV9/11 didn't empower him; it doomed him.
p213
aa(lp214
VWho killed bin Ladenism? Abu Musab al-Zarqawi killed it.
p215
aVHe was the especially sadistic head of al Qaeda in Iraq
p216
aVwho sent hundreds of suicide bombers to attack
p217
aVnot Americans but Iraqis. Muslims. Sunni as well as Shiites.
p218
aVAny claim that al Qaeda had to being protectors of Islam
p219
aVagainst the Western crusaders
p220
aVwas drowned in the blood of Iraqi Muslims.
p221
aa(lp222
VWho killed Osama bin Laden? The SEAL Team Six.
p223
aVWho killed bin Ladenism? Al Jazeera did,
p224
aVAl Jazeera and half a dozen other satellite news stations in Arabic,
p225
aVbecause they circumvented the old, state-owned
p226
aVtelevision stations in a lot of these countries
p227
aVwhich were designed to keep information from people.
p228
aVAl Jazeera brought information to them, showed them
p229
aVwhat was being said and done in the name of their religion,
p230
aVexposed the hypocrisy of Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda,
p231
aVand allowed them, gave them the information
p232
aVthat allowed them to come to their own conclusions.
p233
aa(lp234
VWho killed bin Ladenism? The Arab Spring did,
p235
aVbecause it showed a way for young Muslims
p236
aVto bring about change
p237
aVin a manner that Osama bin Laden, with his
p238
aVlimited imagination, could never have conceived.
p239
aa(lp240
VWho defeated the global jihad? The American military did,
p241
aVthe American soldiers did, with their allies,
p242
aVfighting in faraway battlefields.
p243
aVAnd perhaps, a time will come when they get the rightful credit for it.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo all these factors, and many more besides,
p246
aVwe don't even fully understand some of them yet,
p247
aVthese came together
p248
aVto defeat a monstrosity as big as bin Ladenism,
p249
aVthe global jihad, you needed this group effort.
p250
aa(lp251
VNow, not all of these things will work in local jihad.
p252
aVThe American military is not going to march into Nigeria
p253
aVto take on Boko Haram,
p254
aVand it's unlikely that SEAL Team Six will rappel
p255
aVinto the homes of al Shabaab's leaders and take them out.
p256
aa(lp257
VBut many of these other factors that were in play
p258
aVare now even stronger than before. Half the work is already done.
p259
aVWe don't have to reinvent the wheel.
p260
aVThe notion of violent jihad in which more Muslims are killed
p261
aVthan any other kind of people is already thoroughly discredited.
p262
aVWe don't have to go back to that.
p263
aVSatellite television and the Internet are informing
p264
aVand empowering young Muslims in exciting new ways.
p265
aVAnd the Arab Spring has produced governments,
p266
aVmany of them Islamist governments,
p267
aVwho know that, for their own self-preservation,
p268
aVthey need to take on the extremists in their midsts.
p269
aVWe don't need to persuade them, but we do need to help them,
p270
aVbecause they haven't really come to this place before.
p271
aa(lp272
VThe good news, again, is that a lot of the things they need
p273
aVwe already have, and we are very good at giving:
p274
aVeconomic assistance, not just money, but expertise,
p275
aVtechnology, knowhow,
p276
aVprivate investment, fair terms of trade,
p277
aVmedicine, education, technical support for training
p278
aVfor their police forces to become more effective,
p279
aVfor their anti-terror forces to become more efficient.
p280
aVWe've got plenty of these things.
p281
aa(lp282
VSome of the other things that they need
p283
aVwe're not very good at giving. Maybe nobody is.
p284
aVTime, patience, subtlety, understanding \u2014
p285
aVthese are harder to give.
p286
aVI live in New York now. Just this week,
p287
aVposters have gone up in subway stations in New York
p288
aVthat describe jihad as savage.
p289
aa(lp290
VBut in all the many years that I have covered the Middle East,
p291
aVI have never been as optimistic as I am today
p292
aVthat the gap between the Muslim world and the West
p293
aVis narrowing fast,
p294
aVand one of the many reasons for my optimism
p295
aVis that, because I know there are millions,
p296
aVhundreds of millions of people, Muslims like that old imam
p297
aVin Tunis, who are reclaiming this word
p298
aVand restoring to its original, beautiful purpose.
p299
aVBin Laden is dead. Bin Ladenism has been defeated.
p300
aVHis definition of jihad can now be expunged.
p301
aVTo that jihad we can say, "Goodbye. Good riddance."
p302
aVTo the real jihad we can say, "Welcome back. Good luck."
p303
aVThank you. (Applause)

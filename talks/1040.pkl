VSo for any of us in this room today, let's start out by admitting we're lucky.
p5
aVWe don't live in the world our mothers lived in,
p6
aVour grandmothers lived in,
p7
aVwhere career choices for women were so limited.
p8
aVAnd if you're in this room today,
p9
aVmost of us grew up in a world where we have basic civil rights,
p10
aVand amazingly, we still live in a world where some women don't have them.
p11
aVBut all that aside, we still have a problem,
p12
aVand it's a real problem.
p13
aVAnd the problem is this:
p14
aVWomen are not making it to the top of any profession
p15
aVanywhere in the world.
p16
aVThe numbers tell the story quite clearly.
p17
aV190 heads of state \u2014 nine are women.
p18
aVOf all the people in parliament in the world,
p19
aV13 percent are women.
p20
aVIn the corporate sector, women at the top,
p21
aVC-level jobs, board seats \u2014
p22
aVtops out at 15, 16 percent.
p23
aVThe numbers have not moved since 2002
p24
aVand are going in the wrong direction.
p25
aVAnd even in the non-profit world,
p26
aVa world we sometimes think of as being led by more women,
p27
aVwomen at the top: 20 percent.
p28
aa(lp29
VWe also have another problem,
p30
aVwhich is that women face harder choices
p31
aVbetween professional success and personal fulfillment.
p32
aVA recent study in the U.S. showed that, of married senior managers,
p33
aVtwo-thirds of the married men had children
p34
aVand only one-third of the married women had children.
p35
aVA couple of years ago, I was in New York,
p36
aVand I was pitching a deal,
p37
aVand I was in one of those fancy New York private equity offices
p38
aVyou can picture.
p39
aVAnd I'm in the meeting \u2014 it's about a three-hour meeting \u2014
p40
aVand two hours in, there needs to be that bio break,
p41
aVand everyone stands up,
p42
aVand the partner running the meeting starts looking really embarrassed.
p43
aVAnd I realized he doesn't know where the women's room is in his office.
p44
aVSo I start looking around for moving boxes,
p45
aVfiguring they just moved in, but I don't see any.
p46
aVAnd so I said, "Did you just move into this office?"
p47
aVAnd he said, "No, we've been here about a year."
p48
aVAnd I said, "Are you telling me that I am the only woman
p49
aVto have pitched a deal in this office in a year?"
p50
aVAnd he looked at me, and he said,
p51
aV"Yeah. Or maybe you're the only one who had to go to the bathroom."
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VSo the question is, how are we going to fix this?
p56
aVHow do we change these numbers at the top?
p57
aVHow do we make this different?
p58
aVI want to start out by saying, I talk about this \u2014
p59
aVabout keeping women in the workforce \u2014
p60
aVbecause I really think that's the answer.
p61
aVIn the high-income part of our workforce,
p62
aVin the people who end up at the top \u2014
p63
aVFortune 500 CEO jobs, or the equivalent in other industries \u2014
p64
aVthe problem, I am convinced, is that women are dropping out.
p65
aVNow people talk about this a lot,
p66
aVand they talk about things like flextime and mentoring
p67
aVand programs companies should have to train women.
p68
aVI want to talk about none of that today,
p69
aVeven though that's all really important.
p70
aVToday I want to focus on what we can do as individuals.
p71
aVWhat are the messages we need to tell ourselves?
p72
aVWhat are the messages we tell the women that work with and for us?
p73
aVWhat are the messages we tell our daughters?
p74
aa(lp75
VNow, at the outset, I want to be very clear
p76
aVthat this speech comes with no judgments.
p77
aVI don't have the right answer.
p78
aVI don't even have it for myself.
p79
aVI left San Francisco, where I live, on Monday,
p80
aVand I was getting on the plane for this conference.
p81
aVAnd my daughter, who's three, when I dropped her off at preschool,
p82
aVdid that whole hugging-the-leg, crying, "Mommy, don't get on the plane" thing.
p83
aVThis is hard. I feel guilty sometimes.
p84
aVI know no women,
p85
aVwhether they're at home or whether they're in the workforce,
p86
aVwho don't feel that sometimes.
p87
aVSo I'm not saying that staying in the workforce
p88
aVis the right thing for everyone.
p89
aa(lp90
VMy talk today is about what the messages are
p91
aVif you do want to stay in the workforce,
p92
aVand I think there are three.
p93
aVOne, sit at the table.
p94
aVTwo, make your partner a real partner.
p95
aVAnd three, don't leave before you leave.
p96
aVNumber one: sit at the table.
p97
aVJust a couple weeks ago at Facebook,
p98
aVwe hosted a very senior government official,
p99
aVand he came in to meet with senior execs
p100
aVfrom around Silicon Valley.
p101
aVAnd everyone kind of sat at the table.
p102
aVHe had these two women who were traveling with him
p103
aVpretty senior in his department,
p104
aVand I kind of said to them,
p105
aV"Sit at the table. Come on, sit at the table,"
p106
aVand they sat on the side of the room.
p107
aVWhen I was in college, my senior year,
p108
aVI took a course called European Intellectual History.
p109
aVDon't you love that kind of thing from college?
p110
aVI wish I could do that now.
p111
aVAnd I took it with my roommate, Carrie,
p112
aVwho was then a brilliant literary student \u2014
p113
aVand went on to be a brilliant literary scholar \u2014
p114
aVand my brother \u2014 smart guy,
p115
aVbut a water-polo-playing pre-med,
p116
aVwho was a sophomore.
p117
aa(lp118
VThe three of us take this class together.
p119
aVAnd then Carrie reads all the books in the original Greek and Latin,
p120
aVgoes to all the lectures.
p121
aVI read all the books in English
p122
aVand go to most of the lectures.
p123
aVMy brother is kind of busy.
p124
aVHe reads one book of 12 and goes to a couple of lectures,
p125
aVmarches himself up to our room
p126
aVa couple days before the exam to get himself tutored.
p127
aVThe three of us go to the exam together, and we sit down.
p128
aVAnd we sit there for three hours \u2014
p129
aVand our little blue notebooks \u2014 yes, I'm that old.
p130
aVWe walk out, we look at each other, and we say, "How did you do?"
p131
aVAnd Carrie says, "Boy, I feel like I didn't really draw out the main point
p132
aVon the Hegelian dialectic."
p133
aVAnd I say, "God, I really wish I had really connected
p134
aVJohn Locke's theory of property with the philosophers that follow."
p135
aVAnd my brother says,
p136
aV"I got the top grade in the class."
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
V"You got the top grade in the class?
p141
aVYou don't know anything."
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VThe problem with these stories is that they show what the data shows:
p146
aVwomen systematically underestimate their own abilities.
p147
aVIf you test men and women,
p148
aVand you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like GPAs,
p149
aVmen get it wrong slightly high,
p150
aVand women get it wrong slightly low.
p151
aVWomen do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce.
p152
aVA study in the last two years
p153
aVof people entering the workforce out of college
p154
aVshowed that 57 percent of boys entering, or men, I guess,
p155
aVare negotiating their first salary,
p156
aVand only seven percent of women.
p157
aVAnd most importantly,
p158
aVmen attribute their success to themselves,
p159
aVand women attribute it to other external factors.
p160
aVIf you ask men why they did a good job,
p161
aVthey'll say, "I'm awesome.
p162
aVObviously. Why are you even asking?"
p163
aVIf you ask women why they did a good job,
p164
aVwhat they'll say is someone helped them,
p165
aVthey got lucky, they worked really hard.
p166
aVWhy does this matter?
p167
aVBoy, it matters a lot.
p168
aVBecause no one gets to the corner office
p169
aVby sitting on the side, not at the table,
p170
aVand no one gets the promotion
p171
aVif they don't think they deserve their success,
p172
aVor they don't even understand their own success.
p173
aa(lp174
VI wish the answer were easy.
p175
aVI wish I could go tell all the young women I work for,
p176
aVthese fabulous women,
p177
aV"Believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself.
p178
aVOwn your own success."
p179
aVI wish I could tell that to my daughter.
p180
aVBut it's not that simple.
p181
aVBecause what the data shows, above all else, is one thing,
p182
aVwhich is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men
p183
aVand negatively correlated for women.
p184
aVAnd everyone's nodding, because we all know this to be true.
p185
aa(lp186
VThere's a really good study that shows this really well.
p187
aVThere's a famous Harvard Business School study
p188
aVon a woman named Heidi Roizen.
p189
aVAnd she's an operator in a company in Silicon Valley,
p190
aVand she uses her contacts
p191
aVto become a very successful venture capitalist.
p192
aVIn 2002 \u2014 not so long ago \u2014
p193
aVa professor who was then at Columbia University
p194
aVtook that case and made it [Howard] Roizen.
p195
aVAnd he gave the case out, both of them, to two groups of students.
p196
aVHe changed exactly one word:
p197
aV"Heidi" to "Howard."
p198
aVBut that one word made a really big difference.
p199
aVHe then surveyed the students,
p200
aVand the good news was the students, both men and women,
p201
aVthought Heidi and Howard were equally competent,
p202
aVand that's good.
p203
aVThe bad news was that everyone liked Howard.
p204
aVHe's a great guy. You want to work for him.
p205
aVYou want to spend the day fishing with him.
p206
aVBut Heidi? Not so sure.
p207
aVShe's a little out for herself. She's a little political.
p208
aVYou're not sure you'd want to work for her.
p209
aVThis is the complication.
p210
aVWe have to tell our daughters and our colleagues,
p211
aVwe have to tell ourselves to believe we got the A,
p212
aVto reach for the promotion, to sit at the table,
p213
aVand we have to do it in a world
p214
aVwhere, for them, there are sacrifices they will make for that,
p215
aVeven though for their brothers, there are not.
p216
aa(lp217
VThe saddest thing about all of this is that it's really hard to remember this.
p218
aVAnd I'm about to tell a story which is truly embarrassing for me,
p219
aVbut I think important.
p220
aVI gave this talk at Facebook not so long ago
p221
aVto about 100 employees,
p222
aVand a couple hours later, there was a young woman who works there
p223
aVsitting outside my little desk, and she wanted to talk to me.
p224
aVI said, okay, and she sat down, and we talked.
p225
aVAnd she said, "I learned something today.
p226
aVI learned that I need to keep my hand up."
p227
aV"What do you mean?"
p228
aVShe said, "You're giving this talk,
p229
aVand you said you would take two more questions.
p230
aVI had my hand up with many other people,
p231
aVand you took two more questions.
p232
aVI put my hand down, and I noticed all the women did the same,
p233
aVand then you took more questions,
p234
aVonly from the men."
p235
aVAnd I thought to myself,
p236
aV"Wow, if it's me \u2014 who cares about this, obviously \u2014
p237
aVgiving this talk \u2014
p238
aVand during this talk, I can't even notice that the men's hands are still raised,
p239
aVand the women's hands are still raised,
p240
aVhow good are we
p241
aVas managers of our companies and our organizations
p242
aVat seeing that the men are reaching for opportunities
p243
aVmore than women?"
p244
aVWe've got to get women to sit at the table.
p245
aa(lp246
V(Cheers)
p247
aa(lp248
V(Applause)
p249
aa(lp250
VMessage number two:
p251
aVMake your partner a real partner.
p252
aVI've become convinced that we've made more progress in the workforce
p253
aVthan we have in the home.
p254
aVThe data shows this very clearly.
p255
aVIf a woman and a man work full-time and have a child,
p256
aVthe woman does twice the amount of housework the man does,
p257
aVand the woman does three times the amount of childcare the man does.
p258
aVSo she's got three jobs or two jobs, and he's got one.
p259
aVWho do you think drops out when someone needs to be home more?
p260
aVThe causes of this are really complicated, and I don't have time to go into them.
p261
aVAnd I don't think Sunday football-watching and general laziness is the cause.
p262
aa(lp263
VI think the cause is more complicated.
p264
aVI think, as a society,
p265
aVwe put more pressure on our boys to succeed
p266
aVthan we do on our girls.
p267
aVI know men that stay home
p268
aVand work in the home to support wives with careers,
p269
aVand it's hard.
p270
aVWhen I go to the Mommy-and-Me stuff and I see the father there,
p271
aVI notice that the other mommies don't play with him.
p272
aVAnd that's a problem,
p273
aVbecause we have to make it as important a job,
p274
aVbecause it's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home,
p275
aVfor people of both genders,
p276
aVif we're going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce.
p277
aa(lp278
V(Applause)
p279
aa(lp280
VStudies show that households with equal earning
p281
aVand equal responsibility
p282
aValso have half the divorce rate.
p283
aVAnd if that wasn't good enough motivation for everyone out there,
p284
aVthey also have more \u2014
p285
aVhow shall I say this on this stage?
p286
aVThey know each other more in the biblical sense as well.
p287
aa(lp288
V(Cheers)
p289
aa(lp290
VMessage number three:
p291
aVDon't leave before you leave.
p292
aVI think there's a really deep irony
p293
aVto the fact that actions women are taking \u2014
p294
aVand I see this all the time \u2014
p295
aVwith the objective of staying in the workforce
p296
aVactually lead to their eventually leaving.
p297
aVHere's what happens:
p298
aVWe're all busy. Everyone's busy. A woman's busy.
p299
aVAnd she starts thinking about having a child,
p300
aVand from the moment she starts thinking about having a child,
p301
aVshe starts thinking about making room for that child.
p302
aV"How am I going to fit this into everything else I'm doing?"
p303
aVAnd literally from that moment,
p304
aVshe doesn't raise her hand anymore,
p305
aVshe doesn't look for a promotion, she doesn't take on the new project,
p306
aVshe doesn't say, "Me. I want to do that."
p307
aVShe starts leaning back.
p308
aVThe problem is that \u2014
p309
aVlet's say she got pregnant that day, that day \u2014
p310
aVnine months of pregnancy, three months of maternity leave,
p311
aVsix months to catch your breath \u2014
p312
aVFast-forward two years,
p313
aVmore often \u2014 and as I've seen it \u2014
p314
aVwomen start thinking about this way earlier \u2014
p315
aVwhen they get engaged, or married,
p316
aVwhen they start thinking about having a child,
p317
aVwhich can take a long time.
p318
aVOne woman came to see me about this.
p319
aVShe looked a little young.
p320
aVAnd I said, "So are you and your husband thinking about having a baby?"
p321
aVAnd she said, "Oh no, I'm not married."
p322
aVShe didn't even have a boyfriend.
p323
aa(lp324
V(Laughter)
p325
aa(lp326
VI said, "You're thinking about this just way too early."
p327
aa(lp328
VBut the point is that what happens
p329
aVonce you start kind of quietly leaning back?
p330
aVEveryone who's been through this \u2014
p331
aVand I'm here to tell you, once you have a child at home,
p332
aVyour job better be really good to go back,
p333
aVbecause it's hard to leave that kid at home.
p334
aVYour job needs to be challenging.
p335
aVIt needs to be rewarding.
p336
aVYou need to feel like you're making a difference.
p337
aVAnd if two years ago you didn't take a promotion
p338
aVand some guy next to you did,
p339
aVif three years ago you stopped looking for new opportunities,
p340
aVyou're going to be bored
p341
aVbecause you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal.
p342
aVDon't leave before you leave.
p343
aVStay in.
p344
aVKeep your foot on the gas pedal,
p345
aVuntil the very day you need to leave to take a break for a child \u2014
p346
aVand then make your decisions.
p347
aVDon't make decisions too far in advance,
p348
aVparticularly ones you're not even conscious you're making.
p349
aa(lp350
VMy generation really, sadly,
p351
aVis not going to change the numbers at the top.
p352
aVThey're just not moving.
p353
aVWe are not going to get to where 50 percent of the population \u2014
p354
aVin my generation, there will not be 50 percent of [women]
p355
aVat the top of any industry.
p356
aVBut I'm hopeful that future generations can.
p357
aVI think a world where half of our countries and our companies
p358
aVwere run by women, would be a better world.
p359
aVIt's not just because people would know where the women's bathrooms are,
p360
aVeven though that would be very helpful.
p361
aVI think it would be a better world.
p362
aVI have two children.
p363
aVI have a five-year-old son and a two-year-old daughter.
p364
aVI want my son to have a choice
p365
aVto contribute fully in the workforce or at home,
p366
aVand I want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed,
p367
aVbut to be liked for her accomplishments.
p368
aa(lp369
VThank you.
p370
aa(lp371

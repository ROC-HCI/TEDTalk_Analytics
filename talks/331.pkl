VSo, people argue vigorously about the definition of life.
p5
aVThey ask if it should have reproduction in it, or metabolism, or evolution.
p6
aVAnd I don't know the answer to that, so I'm not going to tell you.
p7
aVI will say that life involves computation.
p8
aVSo this is a computer program.
p9
aVBooted up in a cell, the program would execute,
p10
aVand it could result in this person;
p11
aVor with a small change, it could result in this person;
p12
aVor another small change, this person;
p13
aVor with a larger change, this dog,
p14
aVor this tree, or this whale.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo now, if you take this metaphor
p17
aV[of] genome as program seriously,
p18
aVyou have to consider that Chris Anderson
p19
aVis a computer-fabricated artifact, as is Jim Watson,
p20
aVCraig Venter, as are all of us.
p21
aVAnd in convincing yourself that this metaphor is true,
p22
aVthere are lots of similarities between genetic programs
p23
aVand computer programs that could help to convince you.
p24
aVBut one, to me, that's most compelling
p25
aVis the peculiar sensitivity to small changes
p26
aVthat can make large changes in biological development \u2014 the output.
p27
aVA small mutation can take a two-wing fly
p28
aVand make it a four-wing fly.
p29
aVOr it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be.
p30
aVOr if you're familiar with "The Princess Bride,"
p31
aVit could create a six-fingered man.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow, a hallmark of computer programs
p34
aVis just this kind of sensitivity to small changes.
p35
aVIf your bank account's one dollar, and you flip a single bit,
p36
aVyou could end up with a thousand dollars.
p37
aVSo these small changes are things that I think
p38
aVthat \u2014 they indicate to us that a complicated computation
p39
aVin development is underlying these amplified, large changes.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo now, all of this indicates that there are molecular programs underlying biology,
p42
aVand it shows the power of molecular programs \u2014 biology does.
p43
aVAnd what I want to do is write molecular programs,
p44
aVpotentially to build technology.
p45
aVAnd there are a lot of people doing this,
p46
aVa lot of synthetic biologists doing this, like Craig Venter.
p47
aVAnd they concentrate on using cells.
p48
aVThey're cell-oriented.
p49
aVSo my friends, molecular programmers, and I
p50
aVhave a sort of biomolecule-centric approach.
p51
aVWe're interested in using DNA, RNA and protein,
p52
aVand building new languages for building things from the bottom up,
p53
aVusing biomolecules,
p54
aVpotentially having nothing to do with biology.
p55
aVSo, these are all the machines in a cell.
p56
aVThere's a camera.
p57
aVThere's the solar panels of the cell,
p58
aVsome switches that turn your genes on and off,
p59
aVthe girders of the cell, motors that move your muscles.
p60
aVMy little group of molecular programmers
p61
aVare trying to refashion all of these parts from DNA.
p62
aVWe're not DNA zealots, but DNA is the cheapest,
p63
aVeasiest to understand and easy to program material to do this.
p64
aVAnd as other things become easier to use \u2014
p65
aVmaybe protein \u2014 we'll work with those.
p66
aa(lp67
VIf we succeed, what will molecular programming look like?
p68
aVYou're going to sit in front of your computer.
p69
aVYou're going to design something like a cell phone,
p70
aVand in a high-level language, you'll describe that cell phone.
p71
aVThen you're going to have a compiler
p72
aVthat's going to take that description
p73
aVand it's going to turn it into actual molecules
p74
aVthat can be sent to a synthesizer
p75
aVand that synthesizer will pack those molecules into a seed.
p76
aVAnd what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately,
p77
aVis it will do a developmental computation,
p78
aVa molecular computation, and it'll build an electronic computer.
p79
aVAnd if I haven't revealed my prejudices already,
p80
aVI think that life has been about molecular computers
p81
aVbuilding electrochemical computers,
p82
aVbuilding electronic computers,
p83
aVwhich together with electrochemical computers
p84
aVwill build new molecular computers,
p85
aVwhich will build new electronic computers, and so forth.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd if you buy all of this,
p88
aVand you think life is about computation, as I do,
p89
aVthen you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist.
p90
aVSo one big question is, how does a baby know when to stop growing?
p91
aVAnd for molecular programming,
p92
aVthe question is how does your cell phone know when to stop growing?
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aVOr how does a computer program know when to stop running?
p95
aVOr more to the point, how do you know if a program will ever stop?
p96
aVThere are other questions like this, too.
p97
aVOne of them is Craig Venter's question.
p98
aVTurns out I think he's actually a computer scientist.
p99
aVHe asked, how big is the minimal genome
p100
aVthat will give me a functioning microorganism?
p101
aVHow few genes can I use?
p102
aVThis is exactly analogous to the question,
p103
aVwhat's the smallest program I can write
p104
aVthat will act exactly like Microsoft Word?
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aVAnd just as he's writing, you know, bacteria that will be smaller,
p107
aVhe's writing genomes that will work,
p108
aVwe could write smaller programs
p109
aVthat would do what Microsoft Word does.
p110
aa(lp111
VBut for molecular programming, our question is,
p112
aVhow many molecules do we need to put in that seed to get a cell phone?
p113
aVWhat's the smallest number we can get away with?
p114
aVNow, these are big questions in computer science.
p115
aVThese are all complexity questions,
p116
aVand computer science tells us that these are very hard questions.
p117
aVAlmost \u2014 many of them are impossible.
p118
aVBut for some tasks, we can start to answer them.
p119
aVSo, I'm going to start asking those questions
p120
aVfor the DNA structures I'm going to talk about next.
p121
aVSo, this is normal DNA, what you think of as normal DNA.
p122
aVIt's double-stranded, it's a double helix,
p123
aVhas the As, Ts, Cs and Gs that pair to hold the strands together.
p124
aVAnd I'm going to draw it like this sometimes,
p125
aVjust so I don't scare you.
p126
aVWe want to look at individual strands and not think about the double helix.
p127
aVWhen we synthesize it, it comes single-stranded,
p128
aVso we can take the blue strand in one tube
p129
aVand make an orange strand in the other tube,
p130
aVand they're floppy when they're single-stranded.
p131
aVYou mix them together and they make a rigid double helix.
p132
aVNow for the last 25 years,
p133
aVNed Seeman and a bunch of his descendants
p134
aVhave worked very hard and made beautiful three-dimensional structures
p135
aVusing this kind of reaction of DNA strands coming together.
p136
aVBut a lot of their approaches, though elegant, take a long time.
p137
aVThey can take a couple of years, or it can be difficult to design.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo I came up with a new method a couple of years ago
p140
aVI call DNA origami
p141
aVthat's so easy you could do it at home in your kitchen
p142
aVand design the stuff on a laptop.
p143
aVBut to do it, you need a long, single strand of DNA,
p144
aVwhich is technically very difficult to get.
p145
aVSo, you can go to a natural source.
p146
aVYou can look in this computer-fabricated artifact,
p147
aVand he's got a double-stranded genome \u2014 that's no good.
p148
aVYou look in his intestines. There are billions of bacteria.
p149
aVThey're no good either.
p150
aVDouble strand again, but inside them, they're infected with a virus
p151
aVthat has a nice, long, single-stranded genome
p152
aVthat we can fold like a piece of paper.
p153
aVAnd here's how we do it.
p154
aa(lp155
VThis is part of that genome.
p156
aVWe add a bunch of short, synthetic DNAs that I call staples.
p157
aVEach one has a left half that binds the long strand in one place,
p158
aVand a right half that binds it in a different place,
p159
aVand brings the long strand together like this.
p160
aVThe net action of many of these on that long strand
p161
aVis to fold it into something like a rectangle.
p162
aa(lp163
VNow, we can't actually take a movie of this process,
p164
aVbut Shawn Douglas at Harvard
p165
aVhas made a nice visualization for us
p166
aVthat begins with a long strand and has some short strands in it.
p167
aVAnd what happens is that we mix these strands together.
p168
aVWe heat them up, we add a little bit of salt,
p169
aVwe heat them up to almost boiling and cool them down,
p170
aVand as we cool them down,
p171
aVthe short strands bind the long strands
p172
aVand start to form structure.
p173
aVAnd you can see a little bit of double helix forming there.
p174
aVWhen you look at DNA origami,
p175
aVyou can see that what it really is,
p176
aVeven though you think it's complicated,
p177
aVis a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other,
p178
aVand they're held together
p179
aVby places where short strands go along one helix
p180
aVand then jump to another one.
p181
aVSo there's a strand that goes like this, goes along one helix and binds \u2014
p182
aVit jumps to another helix and comes back.
p183
aVThat holds the long strand like this.
p184
aa(lp185
VNow, to show that we could make any shape or pattern
p186
aVthat we wanted, I tried to make this shape.
p187
aVI wanted to fold DNA into something that goes up over the eye,
p188
aVdown the nose, up the nose, around the forehead,
p189
aVback down and end in a little loop like this.
p190
aVAnd so, I thought, if this could work, anything could work.
p191
aVSo I had the computer program design the short staples to do this.
p192
aVI ordered them; they came by FedEx.
p193
aVI mixed them up, heated them, cooled them down,
p194
aVand I got 50 billion little smiley faces
p195
aVfloating around in a single drop of water.
p196
aVAnd each one of these is just
p197
aVone-thousandth the width of a human hair, OK?
p198
aa(lp199
VSo, they're all floating around in solution, and to look at them,
p200
aVyou have to get them on a surface where they stick.
p201
aVSo, you pour them out onto a surface
p202
aVand they start to stick to that surface,
p203
aVand we take a picture using an atomic-force microscope.
p204
aVIt's got a needle, like a record needle,
p205
aVthat goes back and forth over the surface,
p206
aVbumps up and down, and feels the height of the first surface.
p207
aVIt feels the DNA origami.
p208
aVThere's the atomic-force microscope working
p209
aVand you can see that the landing's a little rough.
p210
aVWhen you zoom in, they've got, you know,
p211
aVweak jaws that flip over their heads
p212
aVand some of their noses get punched out, but it's pretty good.
p213
aVYou can zoom in and even see the extra little loop,
p214
aVthis little nano-goatee.
p215
aa(lp216
VNow, what's great about this is anybody can do this.
p217
aVAnd so, I got this in the mail about a year after I did this, unsolicited.
p218
aVAnyone know what this is? What is it?
p219
aVIt's China, right?
p220
aVSo, what happened is, a graduate student in China,
p221
aVLulu Qian, did a great job.
p222
aVShe wrote all her own software
p223
aVto design and built this DNA origami,
p224
aVa beautiful rendition of China, which even has Taiwan,
p225
aVand you can see it's sort of on the world's shortest leash, right?
p226
aV(Laughter)
p227
aVSo, this works really well
p228
aVand you can make patterns as well as shapes, OK?
p229
aVAnd you can make a map of the Americas and spell DNA with DNA.
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd what's really neat about it \u2014
p232
aVwell, actually, this all looks like nano-artwork,
p233
aVbut it turns out that nano-artwork
p234
aVis just what you need to make nano-circuits.
p235
aVSo, you can put circuit components on the staples,
p236
aVlike a light bulb and a light switch.
p237
aVLet the thing assemble, and you'll get some kind of a circuit.
p238
aVAnd then you can maybe wash the DNA away and have the circuit left over.
p239
aVSo, this is what some colleagues of mine at Caltech did.
p240
aVThey took a DNA origami, organized some carbon nano-tubes,
p241
aVmade a little switch, you see here, wired it up,
p242
aVtested it and showed that it is indeed a switch.
p243
aVNow, this is just a single switch
p244
aVand you need half a billion for a computer, so we have a long way to go.
p245
aVBut this is very promising
p246
aVbecause the origami can organize parts just one-tenth the size
p247
aVof those in a normal computer.
p248
aVSo it's very promising for making small computers.
p249
aa(lp250
VNow, I want to get back to that compiler.
p251
aVThe DNA origami is a proof that that compiler actually works.
p252
aVSo, you start with something in the computer.
p253
aVYou get a high-level description of the computer program,
p254
aVa high-level description of the origami.
p255
aVYou can compile it to molecules, send it to a synthesizer,
p256
aVand it actually works.
p257
aVAnd it turns out that a company has made a nice program
p258
aVthat's much better than my code, which was kind of ugly,
p259
aVand will allow us to do this in a nice,
p260
aVvisual, computer-aided design way.
p261
aa(lp262
VSo, now you can say, all right,
p263
aVwhy isn't DNA origami the end of the story?
p264
aVYou have your molecular compiler, you can do whatever you want.
p265
aVThe fact is that it does not scale.
p266
aVSo if you want to build a human from DNA origami,
p267
aVthe problem is, you need a long strand
p268
aVthat's 10 trillion trillion bases long.
p269
aVThat's three light years' worth of DNA,
p270
aVso we're not going to do this.
p271
aVWe're going to turn to another technology,
p272
aVcalled algorithmic self-assembly of tiles.
p273
aVIt was started by Erik Winfree,
p274
aVand what it does,
p275
aVit has tiles that are a hundredth the size of a DNA origami.
p276
aVYou zoom in, there are just four DNA strands
p277
aVand they have little single-stranded bits on them
p278
aVthat can bind to other tiles, if they match.
p279
aVAnd we like to draw these tiles as little squares.
p280
aVAnd if you look at their sticky ends, these little DNA bits,
p281
aVyou can see that they actually form a checkerboard pattern.
p282
aVSo, these tiles would make a complicated, self-assembling checkerboard.
p283
aVAnd the point of this, if you didn't catch that,
p284
aVis that tiles are a kind of molecular program
p285
aVand they can output patterns.
p286
aVAnd a really amazing part of this is
p287
aVthat any computer program can be translated
p288
aVinto one of these tile programs \u2014 specifically, counting.
p289
aVSo, you can come up with a set of tiles
p290
aVthat when they come together, form a little binary counter
p291
aVrather than a checkerboard.
p292
aVSo you can read off binary numbers five, six and seven.
p293
aa(lp294
VAnd in order to get these kinds of computations started right,
p295
aVyou need some kind of input, a kind of seed.
p296
aVYou can use DNA origami for that.
p297
aVYou can encode the number 32
p298
aVin the right-hand side of a DNA origami,
p299
aVand when you add those tiles that count,
p300
aVthey will start to count \u2014 they will read that 32
p301
aVand they'll stop at 32.
p302
aVSo, what we've done is we've figured out a way
p303
aVto have a molecular program know when to stop going.
p304
aVIt knows when to stop growing because it can count.
p305
aVIt knows how big it is.
p306
aVSo, that answers that sort of first question I was talking about.
p307
aVIt doesn't tell us how babies do it, however.
p308
aa(lp309
VSo now, we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things
p310
aVthan DNA origami could otherwise.
p311
aVHere's the DNA origami, and what we can do
p312
aVis we can write 32 on both edges of the DNA origami,
p313
aVand we can now use our watering can
p314
aVand water with tiles, and we can start growing tiles off of that
p315
aVand create a square.
p316
aVThe counter serves as a template
p317
aVto fill in a square in the middle of this thing.
p318
aVSo, what we've done is we've succeeded
p319
aVin making something much bigger than a DNA origami
p320
aVby combining DNA origami with tiles.
p321
aVAnd the neat thing about it is, is that it's also reprogrammable.
p322
aVYou can just change a couple of the DNA strands in this binary representation
p323
aVand you'll get 96 rather than 32.
p324
aVAnd if you do that, the origami's the same size,
p325
aVbut the resulting square that you get is three times bigger.
p326
aa(lp327
VSo, this sort of recapitulates
p328
aVwhat I was telling you about development.
p329
aVYou have a very sensitive computer program
p330
aVwhere small changes \u2014 single, tiny, little mutations \u2014
p331
aVcan take something that made one size square
p332
aVand make something very much bigger.
p333
aVNow, this \u2014 using counting to compute
p334
aVand build these kinds of things
p335
aVby this kind of developmental process
p336
aVis something that also has bearing on Craig Venter's question.
p337
aVSo, you can ask, how many DNA strands are required
p338
aVto build a square of a given size?
p339
aVIf we wanted to make a square of size 10, 100 or 1,000,
p340
aVif we used DNA origami alone,
p341
aVwe would require a number of DNA strands that's the square
p342
aVof the size of that square;
p343
aVso we'd need 100, 10,000 or a million DNA strands.
p344
aVThat's really not affordable.
p345
aVBut if we use a little computation \u2014
p346
aVwe use origami, plus some tiles that count \u2014
p347
aVthen we can get away with using 100, 200 or 300 DNA strands.
p348
aVAnd so we can exponentially reduce the number of DNA strands we use,
p349
aVif we use counting, if we use a little bit of computation.
p350
aVAnd so computation is some very powerful way
p351
aVto reduce the number of molecules you need to build something,
p352
aVto reduce the size of the genome that you're building.
p353
aa(lp354
VAnd finally, I'm going to get back to that sort of crazy idea
p355
aVabout computers building computers.
p356
aVIf you look at the square that you build with the origami
p357
aVand some counters growing off it,
p358
aVthe pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need
p359
aVto make a memory.
p360
aVSo if you affix some wires and switches to those tiles \u2014
p361
aVrather than to the staple strands, you affix them to the tiles \u2014
p362
aVthen they'll self-assemble the somewhat complicated circuits,
p363
aVthe demultiplexer circuits, that you need to address this memory.
p364
aVSo you can actually make a complicated circuit
p365
aVusing a little bit of computation.
p366
aVIt's a molecular computer building an electronic computer.
p367
aVNow, you ask me, how far have we gotten down this path?
p368
aVExperimentally, this is what we've done in the last year.
p369
aVHere is a DNA origami rectangle,
p370
aVand here are some tiles growing from it.
p371
aVAnd you can see how they count.
p372
aVOne, two, three, four, five, six, nine, 10, 11, 12, 17.
p373
aVSo it's got some errors, but at least it counts up.
p374
aV(Laughter)
p375
aa(lp376
VSo, it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago,
p377
aVand that's about the time constant for how long it takes
p378
aVto do these kinds of things, so I think we made a lot of progress.
p379
aVWe've got ideas about how to fix these errors.
p380
aVAnd I think in the next five or 10 years,
p381
aVwe'll make the kind of squares that I described
p382
aVand maybe even get to some of those self-assembled circuits.
p383
aa(lp384
VSo now, what do I want you to take away from this talk?
p385
aVI want you to remember that
p386
aVto create life's very diverse and complex forms,
p387
aVlife uses computation to do that.
p388
aVAnd the computations that it uses, they're molecular computations,
p389
aVand in order to understand this and get a better handle on it,
p390
aVas Feynman said, you know,
p391
aVwe need to build something to understand it.
p392
aVAnd so we are going to use molecules and refashion this thing,
p393
aVrebuild everything from the bottom up,
p394
aVusing DNA in ways that nature never intended,
p395
aVusing DNA origami,
p396
aVand DNA origami to seed this algorithmic self-assembly.
p397
aa(lp398
VYou know, so this is all very cool,
p399
aVbut what I'd like you to take from the talk,
p400
aVhopefully from some of those big questions,
p401
aVis that this molecular programming isn't just about making gadgets.
p402
aVIt's not just making about \u2014
p403
aVit's making self-assembled cell phones and circuits.
p404
aVWhat it's really about is taking computer science
p405
aVand looking at big questions in a new light,
p406
aVasking new versions of those big questions
p407
aVand trying to understand how biology
p408
aVcan make such amazing things. Thank you.

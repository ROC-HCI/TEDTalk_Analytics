VI want to talk to you about the future of medicine.
p5
aVBut before I do that, I want to talk a little bit about the past.
p6
aVNow, throughout much of the recent history of medicine,
p7
aVwe've thought about illness and treatment
p8
aVin terms of a profoundly simple model.
p9
aVIn fact, the model is so simple
p10
aVthat you could summarize it in six words:
p11
aVhave disease, take pill, kill something.
p12
aa(lp13
VNow, the reason for the dominance of this model
p14
aVis of course the antibiotic revolution.
p15
aVMany of you might not know this, but we happen to be celebrating
p16
aVthe hundredth year of the introduction of antibiotics into the United States.
p17
aVBut what you do know
p18
aVis that that introduction was nothing short of transformative.
p19
aVHere you had a chemical, either from the natural world
p20
aVor artificially synthesized in the laboratory,
p21
aVand it would course through your body,
p22
aVit would find its target,
p23
aVlock into its target \u2014
p24
aVa microbe or some part of a microbe \u2014
p25
aVand then turn off a lock and a key
p26
aVwith exquisite deftness, exquisite specificity.
p27
aVAnd you would end up taking a previously fatal, lethal disease \u2014
p28
aVa pneumonia, syphilis, tuberculosis \u2014
p29
aVand transforming that into a curable, or treatable illness.
p30
aVYou have a pneumonia,
p31
aVyou take penicillin,
p32
aVyou kill the microbe
p33
aVand you cure the disease.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo seductive was this idea,
p36
aVso potent the metaphor of lock and key
p37
aVand killing something,
p38
aVthat it really swept through biology.
p39
aVIt was a transformation like no other.
p40
aVAnd we've really spent the last 100 years
p41
aVtrying to replicate that model over and over again
p42
aVin noninfectious diseases,
p43
aVin chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension and heart disease.
p44
aVAnd it's worked, but it's only worked partly.
p45
aVLet me show you.
p46
aVYou know, if you take the entire universe
p47
aVof all chemical reactions in the human body,
p48
aVevery chemical reaction that your body is capable of,
p49
aVmost people think that that number is on the order of a million.
p50
aVLet's call it a million.
p51
aVAnd now you ask the question,
p52
aVwhat number or fraction of reactions
p53
aVcan actually be targeted
p54
aVby the entire pharmacopoeia, all of medicinal chemistry?
p55
aVThat number is 250.
p56
aVThe rest is chemical darkness.
p57
aVIn other words, 0.025 percent of all chemical reactions in your body
p58
aVare actually targetable by this lock and key mechanism.
p59
aVYou know, if you think about human physiology
p60
aVas a vast global telephone network
p61
aVwith interacting nodes and interacting pieces,
p62
aVthen all of our medicinal chemistry
p63
aVis operating on one tiny corner
p64
aVat the edge, the outer edge, of that network.
p65
aVIt's like all of our pharmaceutical chemistry
p66
aVis a pole operator in Wichita, Kansas
p67
aVwho is tinkering with about 10 or 15 telephone lines.
p68
aa(lp69
VSo what do we do about this idea?
p70
aVWhat if we reorganized this approach?
p71
aVIn fact, it turns out that the natural world
p72
aVgives us a sense of how one might think about illness
p73
aVin a radically different way,
p74
aVrather than disease, medicine, target.
p75
aVIn fact, the natural world is organized hierarchically upwards,
p76
aVnot downwards, but upwards,
p77
aVand we begin with a self-regulating, semi-autonomous unit called a cell.
p78
aVThese self-regulating, semi-autonomous units
p79
aVgive rise to self-regulating, semi-autonomous units called organs,
p80
aVand these organs coalesce to form things called humans,
p81
aVand these organisms ultimately live in environments,
p82
aVwhich are partly self-regulating and partly semi-autonomous.
p83
aa(lp84
VWhat's nice about this scheme, this hierarchical scheme
p85
aVbuilding upwards rather than downwards,
p86
aVis that it allows us to think about illness as well
p87
aVin a somewhat different way.
p88
aVTake a disease like cancer.
p89
aVSince the 1950s,
p90
aVwe've tried rather desperately to apply this lock and key model to cancer.
p91
aVWe've tried to kill cells
p92
aVusing a variety of chemotherapies  or targeted therapies,
p93
aVand as most of us know, that's worked.
p94
aVIt's worked for diseases like leukemia.
p95
aVIt's worked for some forms of breast cancer,
p96
aVbut eventually you run to the ceiling of that approach.
p97
aVAnd it's only in the last 10 years or so
p98
aVthat we've begun to think about using the immune system,
p99
aVremembering that in fact the cancer cell doesn't grow in a vacuum.
p100
aVIt actually grows in a human organism.
p101
aVAnd could you use the organismal capacity,
p102
aVthe fact that human beings have an immune system, to attack cancer?
p103
aVIn fact, it's led to the some of the most spectacular new medicines in cancer.
p104
aa(lp105
VAnd finally there's the level of the environment, isn't there?
p106
aVYou know, we don't think of cancer as altering the environment.
p107
aVBut let me give you an example of a profoundly carcinogenic environment.
p108
aVIt's called a prison.
p109
aVYou take loneliness, you take depression, you take confinement,
p110
aVand you add to that,
p111
aVrolled up in a little white sheet of paper,
p112
aVone of the most potent neurostimulants that we know, called nicotine,
p113
aVand you add to that one of the most potent addictive substances that you know,
p114
aVand you have a pro-carcinogenic environment.
p115
aVBut you can have anti-carcinogenic environments too.
p116
aVThere are attempts to create milieus,
p117
aVchange the hormonal milieu for breast cancer, for instance.
p118
aVWe're trying to change the metabolic milieu for other forms of cancer.
p119
aa(lp120
VOr take another disease, like depression.
p121
aVAgain, working upwards,
p122
aVsince the 1960s and 1970s, we've tried, again, desperately
p123
aVto turn off molecules that operate between nerve cells \u2014
p124
aVserotonin, dopamine \u2014
p125
aVand tried to cure depression that way,
p126
aVand that's worked, but then that reached the limit.
p127
aVAnd we now know that what you really probably need to do
p128
aVis to change the physiology of the organ, the brain,
p129
aVrewire it, remodel it,
p130
aVand that, of course, we know study upon study has shown
p131
aVthat talk therapy does exactly that,
p132
aVand study upon study has shown that talk therapy
p133
aVcombined with medicines, pills,
p134
aVreally is much more effective than either one alone.
p135
aVCan we imagine a more immersive environment that will change depression?
p136
aVCan you lock out the signals that elicit depression?
p137
aVAgain, moving upwards along this hierarchical chain of organization.
p138
aVWhat's really at stake perhaps here
p139
aVis not the medicine itself but a metaphor.
p140
aVRather than killing something,
p141
aVin the case of the great chronic degenerative diseases \u2014
p142
aVkidney failure, diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis \u2014
p143
aVmaybe what we really need to do is change the metaphor to growing something.
p144
aVAnd that's the key, perhaps,
p145
aVto reframing our thinking about medicine.
p146
aa(lp147
VNow, this idea of changing,
p148
aVof creating a perceptual shift, as it were,
p149
aVcame home to me to roost in a very personal manner about 10 years ago.
p150
aVAbout 10 years ago \u2014 I've been a runner most of my life \u2014
p151
aVI went for a run, a Saturday morning run,
p152
aVI came back and woke up and I basically couldn't move.
p153
aVMy right knee was swollen up,
p154
aVand you could hear that ominous crunch of bone against bone.
p155
aVAnd one of the perks of being a physician is that you get to order your own MRIs.
p156
aVAnd I had an MRI the next week, and it looked like that.
p157
aVEssentially, the meniscus of cartilage that is between bone
p158
aVhad been completely torn and the bone itself had been shattered.
p159
aa(lp160
VNow, if you're looking at me and feeling sorry,
p161
aVlet me tell you a few facts.
p162
aVIf I was to take an MRI of every person in this audience,
p163
aV60 percent of you would show signs
p164
aVof bone degeneration and cartilage degeneration like this.
p165
aV85 percent of all women by the age of 70
p166
aVwould show moderate to severe cartilage degeneration.
p167
aV50 to 60 percent of the men in this audience
p168
aVwould also have such signs.
p169
aVSo this is a very common disease.
p170
aVWell, the second perk of being a physician
p171
aVis that you can get to experiment on your own ailments.
p172
aVSo about 10 years ago we began,
p173
aVwe brought this process into the laboratory,
p174
aVand we began to do simple experiments,
p175
aVmechanically trying to fix this degeneration.
p176
aVWe tried to inject chemicals into the knee spaces of animals
p177
aVto try to reverse cartilage degeneration,
p178
aVand to put a short summary on a very long and painful process,
p179
aVessentially it came to naught.
p180
aVNothing happened.
p181
aVAnd then about seven years ago, we had a research student from Australia.
p182
aVThe nice thing about Australians
p183
aVis that they're habitually used to looking at the world upside down.
p184
aa(lp185
V(Laughter)
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd so Dan suggested to me, "You know, maybe it isn't a mechanical problem.
p188
aVMaybe it isn't a chemical problem. Maybe it's a stem cell problem."
p189
aVIn other words, he had two hypotheses.
p190
aVNumber one, there is such a thing as a skeletal stem cell \u2014
p191
aVa skeletal stem cell that builds up the entire vertebrate skeleton,
p192
aVbone, cartilage and the fibrous elements of skeleton,
p193
aVjust like there's a stem cell in blood,
p194
aVjust like there's a stem cell in the nervous system.
p195
aVAnd two, that maybe that, the degeneration or dysfunction of this stem cell
p196
aVis what's causing osteochondral arthritis, a very common ailment.
p197
aVSo really the question was, were we looking for a pill
p198
aVwhen we should have really been looking for a cell.
p199
aVSo we switched our models,
p200
aVand now we began to look for skeletal stem cells.
p201
aVAnd to cut again a long story short,
p202
aVabout five years ago, we found these cells.
p203
aVThey live inside the skeleton.
p204
aVHere's a schematic and then a real photograph of one of them.
p205
aVThe white stuff is bone,
p206
aVand these red columns that you see and the yellow cells
p207
aVare cells that have arisen from one single skeletal stem cell \u2014
p208
aVcolumns of cartilage, columns of bone coming out of a single cell.
p209
aVThese cells are fascinating. They have four properties.
p210
aVNumber one is that they live where they're expected to live.
p211
aVThey live just underneath the surface of the bone,
p212
aVunderneath cartilage.
p213
aVYou know, in biology, it's location, location, location.
p214
aVAnd they move into the appropriate areas and form bone and cartilage.
p215
aVThat's one.
p216
aVHere's an interesting property.
p217
aVYou can take them out of the vertebrate skeleton,
p218
aVyou can culture them in petri dishes in the laboratory,
p219
aVand they are dying to form cartilage.
p220
aVRemember how we couldn't form cartilage for love or money?
p221
aVThese cells are dying to form cartilage.
p222
aVThey form their own furls of cartilage around themselves.
p223
aVThey're also, number three,
p224
aVthe most efficient repairers of fractures that we've ever encountered.
p225
aVThis is a little bone, a mouse bone that we fractured
p226
aVand then let it heal by itself.
p227
aVThese stem cells have come in and repaired, in yellow, the bone,
p228
aVin white, the cartilage, almost completely.
p229
aVSo much so that if you label them with a fluorescent dye
p230
aVyou can see them like some kind of peculiar cellular glue
p231
aVcoming into the area of a fracture,
p232
aVfixing it locally and then stopping their work.
p233
aVNow, the fourth one is the most ominous,
p234
aVand that is that their numbers decline precipitously,
p235
aVprecipitously, tenfold, fiftyfold, as you age.
p236
aa(lp237
VAnd so what had happened, really,
p238
aVis that we found ourselves in a perceptual shift.
p239
aVWe had gone hunting for pills
p240
aVbut we ended up finding theories.
p241
aVAnd in some ways
p242
aVwe had hooked ourselves back onto this idea:
p243
aVcells, organisms, environments,
p244
aVbecause we were now thinking about bone stem cells,
p245
aVwe were thinking about arthritis in terms of a cellular disease.
p246
aa(lp247
VAnd then the next question was, are there organs?
p248
aVCan you build this as an organ outside the body?
p249
aVCan you implant cartilage into areas of trauma?
p250
aVAnd perhaps most interestingly,
p251
aVcan you ascend right up and create environments?
p252
aVYou know, we know that exercise remodels bone,
p253
aVbut come on, none of us is going to exercise.
p254
aVSo could you imagine ways of passively loading and unloading bone
p255
aVso that you can recreate or regenerate degenerating cartilage?
p256
aa(lp257
VAnd perhaps more interesting, and more importantly,
p258
aVthe question is, can you apply this model more globally outside medicine?
p259
aVWhat's at stake, as I said before, is not killing something,
p260
aVbut growing something.
p261
aVAnd it raises a series of, I think, some of the most interesting questions
p262
aVabout how we think about medicine in the future.
p263
aVCould your medicine be a cell and not a pill?
p264
aVHow would we grow these cells?
p265
aVWhat we would we do to stop the malignant growth of these cells?
p266
aVWe heard about the problems of unleashing growth.
p267
aVCould we implant suicide genes into these cells
p268
aVto stop them from growing?
p269
aVCould your medicine be an organ that's created outside the body
p270
aVand then implanted into the body?
p271
aVCould that stop some of the degeneration?
p272
aVWhat if the organ needed to have memory?
p273
aVIn cases of diseases of the nervous system some of those organs had memory.
p274
aVHow could we implant those memories back in?
p275
aVCould we store these organs?
p276
aVWould each organ have to be developed for an individual human being
p277
aVand put back?
p278
aVAnd perhaps most puzzlingly,
p279
aVcould your medicine be an environment?
p280
aVCould you patent an environment?
p281
aVYou know, in every culture,
p282
aVshamans have been using environments as medicines.
p283
aVCould we imagine that for our future?
p284
aVI've talked a lot about models. I began this talk with models.
p285
aVSo let me end with some thoughts about model building.
p286
aVThat's what we do as scientists.
p287
aVYou know, when an architect builds a model,
p288
aVhe or she is trying to show you a world in miniature.
p289
aVBut when a scientist is building a model,
p290
aVhe or she is trying to show you the world in metaphor.
p291
aVHe or she is trying to create a new way of seeing.
p292
aVThe former is a scale shift. The latter is a perceptual shift.
p293
aa(lp294
VNow, antibiotics created such a perceptual shift
p295
aVin our way of thinking about medicine that it really colored, distorted,
p296
aVvery successfully, the way we've thought about medicine for the last hundred years.
p297
aVBut we need new models to think about medicine in the future.
p298
aVThat's what's at stake.
p299
aa(lp300
VYou know, there's a popular trope out there
p301
aVthat the reason we haven't had the transformative impact
p302
aVon the treatment of illness
p303
aVis because we don't have powerful-enough drugs,
p304
aVand that's partly true.
p305
aVBut perhaps the real reason is
p306
aVthat we don't have powerful-enough ways of thinking about medicines.
p307
aVIt's certainly true that
p308
aVit would be lovely to have new medicines.
p309
aVBut perhaps what's really at stake are three more intangible M's:
p310
aVmechanisms, models, metaphors.
p311
aa(lp312
VThank you.
p313
aa(lp314
V(Applause)
p315
aa(lp316
VChris Anderson: I really like this metaphor.
p317
aVHow does it link in?
p318
aVThere's a lot of talk in technologyland
p319
aVabout the personalization of medicine,
p320
aVthat we have all this data and that medical treatments of the future
p321
aVwill be for you specifically, your genome, your current context.
p322
aVDoes that apply to this model you've got here?
p323
aa(lp324
VSiddhartha Mukherjee: It's a very interesting question.
p325
aVWe've thought about personalization of medicine
p326
aVvery much in terms of genomics.
p327
aVThat's because the gene is such a dominant metaphor,
p328
aVagain, to use that same word, in medicine today,
p329
aVthat we think the genome will drive the personalization of medicine.
p330
aVBut of course the genome is just the bottom
p331
aVof a long chain of being, as it were.
p332
aVThat chain of being, really the first organized unit of that, is the cell.
p333
aVSo, if we are really going to deliver in medicine in this way,
p334
aVwe have to think of personalizing cellular therapies,
p335
aVand then personalizing organ or organismal therapies,
p336
aVand ultimately personalizing immersion therapies for the environment.
p337
aVSo I think at every stage, you know \u2014
p338
aVthere's that metaphor, there's turtles all the way.
p339
aVWell, in this, there's personalization all the way.
p340
aa(lp341
VCA: So when you say medicine could be a cell
p342
aVand not a pill,
p343
aVyou're talking about potentially your own cells.
p344
aa(lp345
VSM: Absolutely. CA: So converted to stem cells,
p346
aVperhaps tested against all kinds of drugs or something, and prepared.
p347
aa(lp348
VSM: And there's no perhaps. This is what we're doing.
p349
aVThis is what's happening, and in fact, we're slowly moving,
p350
aVnot away from genomics, but incorporating genomics
p351
aVinto what we call multi-order, semi-autonomous, self-regulating systems,
p352
aVlike cells, like organs, like environments.
p353
aa(lp354
VCA: Thank you so much.
p355
aa(lp356
VSM: Pleasure. Thanks.

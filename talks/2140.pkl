VVision is the most important
p5
aVand prioritized sense that we have.
p6
aVWe are constantly looking
p7
aVat the world around us,
p8
aVand quickly we identify and make sense
p9
aVof what it is that we see.
p10
aa(lp11
VLet's just start with an example
p12
aVof that very fact.
p13
aVI'm going to show you a photograph of a person,
p14
aVjust for a second or two,
p15
aVand I'd like for you to identify
p16
aVwhat emotion is on his face.
p17
aVReady?
p18
aVHere you go. Go with your gut reaction.
p19
aVOkay. What did you see?
p20
aVWell, we actually surveyed
p21
aVover 120 individuals,
p22
aVand the results were mixed.
p23
aVPeople did not agree
p24
aVon what emotion they saw on his face.
p25
aVMaybe you saw discomfort.
p26
aVThat was the most frequent response
p27
aVthat we received.
p28
aVBut if you asked the person on your left,
p29
aVthey might have said regret or skepticism,
p30
aVand if you asked somebody on your right,
p31
aVthey might have said something entirely different,
p32
aVlike hope or empathy.
p33
aVSo we are all looking
p34
aVat the very same face again.
p35
aVWe might see something
p36
aVentirely different,
p37
aVbecause perception is subjective.
p38
aVWhat we think we see
p39
aVis actually filtered
p40
aVthrough our own mind's eye.
p41
aa(lp42
VOf course, there are many other examples
p43
aVof how we see the world through own mind's eye.
p44
aVI'm going to give you just a few.
p45
aVSo dieters, for instance,
p46
aVsee apples as larger
p47
aVthan people who are not counting calories.
p48
aVSoftball players see the ball as smaller
p49
aVif they've just come out of a slump,
p50
aVcompared to people who  had a hot night at the plate.
p51
aVAnd actually, our political beliefs also
p52
aVcan affect the way we see other people,
p53
aVincluding politicians.
p54
aVSo my research team and I decided to test this question.
p55
aVIn 2008, Barack Obama was running for president
p56
aVfor the very first time,
p57
aVand we surveyed hundreds of Americans
p58
aVone month before the election.
p59
aVWhat we found in this survey
p60
aVwas that some people, some Americans,
p61
aVthink photographs like these
p62
aVbest reflect how Obama really looks.
p63
aVOf these people, 75 percent
p64
aVvoted for Obama in the actual election.
p65
aVOther people, though, thought photographs like these
p66
aVbest reflect how Obama really looks.
p67
aV89 percent of these people
p68
aVvoted for McCain.
p69
aVWe presented many photographs of Obama
p70
aVone at a time,
p71
aVso people did not realize that what we were changing
p72
aVfrom one photograph to the next
p73
aVwas whether we had artificially lightened
p74
aVor darkened his skin tone.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo how is that possible?
p77
aVHow could it be that when I look at a person,
p78
aVan object, or an event,
p79
aVI see something very different
p80
aVthan somebody else does?
p81
aVWell, the reasons are many,
p82
aVbut one reason requires that we understand
p83
aVa little bit more about how our eyes work.
p84
aVSo vision scientists know
p85
aVthat the amount of information
p86
aVthat we can see
p87
aVat any given point in time,
p88
aVwhat we can focus on, is actually relatively small.
p89
aVWhat we can see with great sharpness
p90
aVand clarity and accuracy
p91
aVis the equivalent
p92
aVof the surface area of our thumb
p93
aVon our outstretched arm.
p94
aVEverything else around that is blurry,
p95
aVrendering much of what is presented
p96
aVto our eyes as ambiguous.
p97
aVBut we have to clarify
p98
aVand make sense of what it is that we see,
p99
aVand it's our mind that helps us fill in that gap.
p100
aVAs a result, perception is a subjective experience,
p101
aVand that's how we end up seeing
p102
aVthrough our own mind's eye.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo, I'm a social psychologist,
p105
aVand it's questions like these
p106
aVthat really intrigue me.
p107
aVI am fascinated by those times
p108
aVwhen people do not see eye to eye.
p109
aVWhy is it that somebody might
p110
aVliterally see the glass as half full,
p111
aVand somebody literally sees it
p112
aVas half empty?
p113
aVWhat is it about what one person is thinking and feeling
p114
aVthat leads them to see the world
p115
aVin an entirely different way?
p116
aVAnd does that even matter?
p117
aVSo to begin to tackle these questions,
p118
aVmy research team and I decided to delve deeply
p119
aVinto an issue that has received
p120
aVinternational attention:
p121
aVour health and fitness.
p122
aVAcross the world,
p123
aVpeople are struggling to manage their weight,
p124
aVand there is a variety of strategies
p125
aVthat we have to help us keep the pounds off.
p126
aVFor instance, we set the best of intentions
p127
aVto exercise after the holidays,
p128
aVbut actually, the majority of Americans
p129
aVfind that their New Year's resolutions
p130
aVare broken by Valentine's Day.
p131
aVWe talk to ourselves
p132
aVin very encouraging ways,
p133
aVtelling ourselves this is our year
p134
aVto get back into shape,
p135
aVbut that is not enough to bring us back
p136
aVto our ideal weight.
p137
aVSo why?
p138
aVOf course, there is no simple answer,
p139
aVbut one reason, I argue,
p140
aVis that our mind's eye
p141
aVmight work against us.
p142
aVSome people may literally see exercise
p143
aVas more difficult,
p144
aVand some people might literally
p145
aVsee exercise as easier.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo, as a first step to testing these questions,
p148
aVwe gathered objective measurements
p149
aVof individuals' physical fitness.
p150
aVWe measured the  circumference of their waist,
p151
aVcompared to the  circumference of their hips.
p152
aVA higher waist-to-hip ratio
p153
aVis an indicator of being less physically fit
p154
aVthan a lower waist-to-hip ratio.
p155
aVAfter gathering these measurements,
p156
aVwe told our participants that
p157
aVthey would walk to a finish line
p158
aVwhile carrying extra weight
p159
aVin a sort of race.
p160
aVBut before they did that,
p161
aVwe asked them to estimate the distance
p162
aVto the finish line.
p163
aVWe thought that the physical states of their body
p164
aVmight change how they perceived the distance.
p165
aVSo what did we find?
p166
aVWell, waist-to-hip ratio
p167
aVpredicted perceptions of distance.
p168
aVPeople who were out of shape and unfit
p169
aVactually saw the distance to the finish line
p170
aVas significantly greater
p171
aVthan people who were in better shape.
p172
aVPeople's states of their own body
p173
aVchanged how they perceived the environment.
p174
aVBut so too can our mind.
p175
aVIn fact, our bodies and our minds
p176
aVwork in tandem
p177
aVto change how we see the world around us.
p178
aa(lp179
VThat led us to think that maybe people
p180
aVwith strong motivations
p181
aVand strong goals to exercise
p182
aVmight actually see the finish line as closer
p183
aVthan people who have weaker motivations.
p184
aVSo to test whether motivations
p185
aVaffect our perceptual experiences in this way,
p186
aVwe conducted a second study.
p187
aVAgain, we gathered objective measurements
p188
aVof people's physical fitness,
p189
aVmeasuring the circumference of their waist
p190
aVand the circumference of their hips,
p191
aVand we had them do a  few other tests of fitness.
p192
aVBased on feedback that we gave them,
p193
aVsome of our participants told us
p194
aVthey're not motivated to exercise any more.
p195
aVThey felt like they already met their fitness goals
p196
aVand they weren't going to do anything else.
p197
aVThese people were not motivated.
p198
aVOther people, though,  based on our feedback,
p199
aVtold us they were highly  motivated to exercise.
p200
aVThey had a strong goal to make it to the finish line.
p201
aVBut again, before we had them walk to the finish line,
p202
aVwe had them estimate the distance.
p203
aVHow far away was the finish line?
p204
aVAnd again, like the previous study,
p205
aVwe found that waist-to-hip ratio
p206
aVpredicted perceptions of distance.
p207
aVUnfit individuals saw the distance as farther,
p208
aVsaw the finish line as farther away,
p209
aVthan people who were in better shape.
p210
aVImportantly, though, this only happened
p211
aVfor people who were not motivated
p212
aVto exercise.
p213
aVOn the other hand,
p214
aVpeople who were highly motivated to exercise
p215
aVsaw the distance as short.
p216
aVEven the most out of shape individuals
p217
aVsaw the finish line
p218
aVas just as close,
p219
aVif not slightly closer,
p220
aVthan people who were in better shape.
p221
aa(lp222
VSo our bodies can change
p223
aVhow far away that finish line looks,
p224
aVbut people who had committed to a manageable goal
p225
aVthat they could accomplish in the near future
p226
aVand who believed that they were capable
p227
aVof meeting that goal
p228
aVactually saw the exercise as easier.
p229
aVThat led us to wonder,
p230
aVis there a strategy that we could use
p231
aVand teach people that would help
p232
aVchange their perceptions of the distance,
p233
aVhelp them make exercise look easier?
p234
aa(lp235
VSo we turned to the vision science literature
p236
aVto figure out what should we do,
p237
aVand based on what we read, we came up with a strategy
p238
aVthat we called, "Keep  your eyes on the prize."
p239
aVSo this is not the slogan
p240
aVfrom an inspirational poster.
p241
aVIt's an actual directive
p242
aVfor how to look around your environment.
p243
aVPeople that we trained in this strategy,
p244
aVwe told them to focus their attention on the finish line,
p245
aVto avoid looking around,
p246
aVto imagine a spotlight
p247
aVwas shining on that goal,
p248
aVand that everything around it was blurry
p249
aVand perhaps difficult to see.
p250
aVWe thought that this strategy
p251
aVwould help make the exercise look easier.
p252
aVWe compared this group
p253
aVto a baseline group.
p254
aVTo this group we said,
p255
aVjust look around the environment
p256
aVas you naturally would.
p257
aVYou will notice the finish line,
p258
aVbut you might also notice
p259
aVthe garbage can off to the right,
p260
aVor the people and the  lamp post off to the left.
p261
aVWe thought that people who used this strategy
p262
aVwould see the distance as farther.
p263
aa(lp264
VSo what did we find?
p265
aVWhen we had them estimate the distance,
p266
aVwas this strategy successful
p267
aVfor changing their perceptual experience?
p268
aVYes.
p269
aVPeople who kept their eyes on the prize
p270
aVsaw the finish line as 30 percent closer
p271
aVthan people who looked around
p272
aVas they naturally would.
p273
aVWe thought this was great.
p274
aVWe were really excited because it meant
p275
aVthat this strategy helped make
p276
aVthe exercise look easier,
p277
aVbut the big question was,
p278
aVcould this help make exercise
p279
aVactually better?
p280
aVCould it improve the quality
p281
aVof exercise as well?
p282
aa(lp283
VSo next, we told our participants,
p284
aVyou are going to walk to the finish line
p285
aVwhile wearing extra weight.
p286
aVWe added weights to their ankles
p287
aVthat amounted to 15 percent of their body weight.
p288
aVWe told them to lift their knees up high
p289
aVand walk to the finish line quickly.
p290
aVWe designed this exercise in particular
p291
aVto be moderately challenging
p292
aVbut not impossible,
p293
aVlike most exercises
p294
aVthat actually improve our fitness.
p295
aa(lp296
VSo the big question, then:
p297
aVDid keeping your eyes on the prize
p298
aVand narrowly focusing on the finish line
p299
aVchange their experience of the exercise?
p300
aVIt did.
p301
aVPeople who kept their eyes on the prize
p302
aVtold us afterward that it required
p303
aV17 percent less exertion
p304
aVfor them to do this exercise
p305
aVthan people who looked around naturally.
p306
aVIt changed their subjective experience
p307
aVof the exercise.
p308
aVIt also changed the objective nature
p309
aVof their exercise.
p310
aVPeople who kept their eyes on the prize
p311
aVactually moved 23 percent faster
p312
aVthan people who looked around naturally.
p313
aVTo put that in perspective,
p314
aVa 23 percent increase
p315
aVis like trading in your 1980 Chevy Citation
p316
aVfor a 1980 Chevrolet Corvette.
p317
aa(lp318
VWe were so excited by this,
p319
aVbecause this meant that a strategy
p320
aVthat costs nothing,
p321
aVthat is easy for people to use,
p322
aVregardless of whether they're in shape
p323
aVor struggling to get there,
p324
aVhad a big effect.
p325
aVKeeping your eyes on the prize
p326
aVmade the exercise look and feel easier
p327
aVeven when people were working harder
p328
aVbecause they were moving faster.
p329
aVNow, I know there's more to good health
p330
aVthan walking a little bit faster,
p331
aVbut keeping your eyes on the prize
p332
aVmight be one additional strategy
p333
aVthat you can use to help promote
p334
aVa healthy lifestyle.
p335
aa(lp336
VIf you're not convinced yet
p337
aVthat we all see the world through our own mind's eye,
p338
aVlet me leave you with one final example.
p339
aVHere's a photograph of a beautiful  street in Stockholm, with two cars.
p340
aVThe car in the back looks much larger
p341
aVthan the car in the front.
p342
aVHowever, in reality,
p343
aVthese cars are the same size,
p344
aVbut that's not how we see it.
p345
aVSo does this mean that
p346
aVour eyes have gone haywire
p347
aVand that our brains are a mess?
p348
aVNo, it doesn't mean that at all.
p349
aVIt's just how our eyes work.
p350
aVWe might see the world in a different way,
p351
aVand sometimes that might not
p352
aVline up with reality,
p353
aVbut it doesn't mean that one of us is right
p354
aVand one of us is wrong.
p355
aVWe all see the world through our mind's eye,
p356
aVbut we can teach ourselves to see it differently.
p357
aa(lp358
VSo I can think of days
p359
aVthat have gone horribly wrong for me.
p360
aVI'm fed up, I'm grumpy, I'm tired,
p361
aVand I'm so behind,
p362
aVand there's a big black cloud
p363
aVhanging over my head,
p364
aVand on days like these,
p365
aVit looks like everyone around me
p366
aVis down in the dumps too.
p367
aVMy colleague at work looks annoyed
p368
aVwhen I ask for an extension on a deadline,
p369
aVand my friend looks frustrated
p370
aVwhen I show up late for lunch because a meeting ran long,
p371
aVand at the end of the day,
p372
aVmy husband looks disappointed
p373
aVbecause I'd rather go to  bed than go to the movies.
p374
aVAnd on days like these, when everybody looks
p375
aVupset and angry to me,
p376
aVI try to remind myself that there are other ways of seeing them.
p377
aVPerhaps my colleague was confused,
p378
aVperhaps my friend was concerned,
p379
aVand perhaps my husband was  feeling empathy instead.
p380
aVSo we all see the world
p381
aVthrough our own mind's eye,
p382
aVand on some days, it might look
p383
aVlike the world is a dangerous
p384
aVand challenging and insurmountable place,
p385
aVbut it doesn't have to look that way all the time.
p386
aVWe can teach ourselves to see it differently,
p387
aVand when we find a way to make the world
p388
aVlook nicer and easier,
p389
aVit might actually become so.
p390
aa(lp391
VThank you.

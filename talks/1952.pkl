VChris Anderson: We had Edward Snowden here
p5
aVa couple days ago,
p6
aVand this is response time.
p7
aVAnd several of you have written to me
p8
aVwith questions to ask our guest here from the NSA.
p9
aVSo Richard Ledgett is the 15th deputy director
p10
aVof the National Security Agency,
p11
aVand he's a senior civilian officer there,
p12
aVacts as its chief operating officer,
p13
aVguiding strategies, setting internal policies,
p14
aVand serving as the principal advisor to the director.
p15
aVAnd all being well,
p16
aVwelcome, Rick Ledgett, to TED.
p17
aV(Applause)
p18
aa(lp19
VRichard Ledgett: I'm really thankful for the opportunity to talk to folks here.
p20
aVI look forward to the conversation,
p21
aVso thanks for arranging for that.
p22
aa(lp23
VCA: Thank you, Rick.
p24
aVWe appreciate you joining us.
p25
aVIt's certainly quite a strong statement
p26
aVthat the NSA is willing to reach out
p27
aVand show a more open face here.
p28
aVYou saw, I think,
p29
aVthe talk and interview that Edward Snowden
p30
aVgave here a couple days ago.
p31
aVWhat did you make of it?
p32
aVRL: So I think it was interesting.
p33
aVWe didn't realize that he  was going to show up there,
p34
aVso kudos to you guys for arranging
p35
aVa nice surprise like that.
p36
aVI think that, like a lot of the things
p37
aVthat have come out since Mr. Snowden
p38
aVstarted disclosing classified information,
p39
aVthere were some kernels of truth in there,
p40
aVbut a lot of extrapolations and half-truths in there,
p41
aVand I'm interested in helping to address those.
p42
aVI think this is a really important conversation
p43
aVthat we're having in the United States
p44
aVand internationally,
p45
aVand I think it is important and of import,
p46
aVand so given that, we need to have that be
p47
aVa fact-based conversation,
p48
aVand we want to help make that happen.
p49
aa(lp50
VCA: So the question that a lot  of people have here is,
p51
aVwhat do you make of Snowden's motivations
p52
aVfor doing what he did,
p53
aVand did he have an alternative way that he could have gone?
p54
aa(lp55
VRL: He absolutely did
p56
aVhave alternative ways that he could have gone,
p57
aVand I actually think that characterizing him
p58
aVas a whistleblower
p59
aVactually hurts legitimate whistleblowing activities.
p60
aVSo what if somebody who works in the NSA \u2014
p61
aVand there are over 35,000 people who do.
p62
aVThey're all great citizens.
p63
aVThey're just like your husbands, fathers, sisters,
p64
aVbrothers, neighbors, nephews, friends and relatives,
p65
aVall of whom are interested in doing the right thing
p66
aVfor their country
p67
aVand for our allies internationally,
p68
aVand so there are a variety of venues to address
p69
aVif folks have a concern.
p70
aVFirst off, there's their supervisor,
p71
aVand up through the supervisory chain
p72
aVwithin their organization.
p73
aVIf folks aren't comfortable with that,
p74
aVthere are a number of inspectors general.
p75
aVIn the case of Mr. Snowden, he had the option
p76
aVof the NSA inspector general,
p77
aVthe Navy inspector general,
p78
aVthe Pacific Command inspector general,
p79
aVthe Department of Defense inspector general,
p80
aVand the intelligence community inspector general,
p81
aVany of whom would have both kept his concerns in classified channels
p82
aVand been happy to address them.
p83
aV(CA and RL speaking at once)
p84
aVHe had the option to go to congressional committees,
p85
aVand there are mechanisms to do that that are in place,
p86
aVand so he didn't do any of those things.
p87
aa(lp88
VCA: Now, you had said that
p89
aVEd Snowden had other avenues
p90
aVfor raising his concerns.
p91
aVThe comeback on that is a couple of things:
p92
aVone, that he certainly believes that as a contractor,
p93
aVthe avenues that would have been available to him as an employee weren't available,
p94
aVtwo, there's a track record of other whistleblowers,
p95
aVlike [Thomas Andrews Drake] being treated
p96
aVpretty harshly, by some views,
p97
aVand thirdly, what he was taking on
p98
aVwas not one specific flaw that he'd discovered,
p99
aVbut programs that had been approved
p100
aVby all three branches of government.
p101
aVI mean, in that circumstance,
p102
aVcouldn't you argue that what he did
p103
aVwas reasonable?
p104
aa(lp105
VRL: No, I don't agree with that.
p106
aVI think that the \u2014
p107
aVsorry, I'm getting feedback
p108
aVthrough the microphone there \u2014
p109
aVthe actions that he took were inappropriate
p110
aVbecause of the fact that  he put people's lives at risk,
p111
aVbasically, in the long run,
p112
aVand I know there's been a lot of talk
p113
aVin public by Mr. Snowden and some of the journalists
p114
aVthat say that the things that have been disclosed
p115
aVhave not put national security and people at risk,
p116
aVand that is categorically not true.
p117
aVThey actually do.
p118
aVI think there's also an amazing arrogance
p119
aVto the idea that he knows better than
p120
aVthe framers of the Constitution
p121
aVin how the government should  be designed and work
p122
aVfor separation of powers
p123
aVand the fact that the executive  and the legislative branch
p124
aVhave to work together and they have checks and balances on each other,
p125
aVand then the judicial branch,
p126
aVwhich oversees the entire process.
p127
aVI think that's extremely arrogant on his part.
p128
aa(lp129
VCA: Can you give a specific example
p130
aVof how he put people's lives at risk?
p131
aa(lp132
VRL: Yeah, sure.
p133
aVSo the things that he's disclosed,
p134
aVthe capabilities,
p135
aVand the NSA is a capabilities-based organization,
p136
aVso when we have foreign intelligence targets,
p137
aVlegitimate things of interest \u2014
p138
aVlike, terrorists is the iconic example,
p139
aVbut it includes things like human traffickers,
p140
aVdrug traffickers,
p141
aVpeople who are trying to build advanced weaponry, nuclear weapons,
p142
aVand build delivery systems for those,
p143
aVand nation-states who might be executing aggression against their immediate neighbors,
p144
aVwhich you may have some visibility
p145
aVinto some of that that's going on right now,
p146
aVthe capabilities are applied
p147
aVin very discrete and measured and controlled ways.
p148
aVSo the unconstrained disclosure  of those capabilities
p149
aVmeans that as adversaries see them
p150
aVand recognize, "Hey, I might be vulnerable to this,"
p151
aVthey move away from that,
p152
aVand we have seen targets in terrorism,
p153
aVin the nation-state area,
p154
aVin smugglers of various types, and other folks
p155
aVwho have, because of the disclosures,
p156
aVmoved away from our ability
p157
aVto have insight into what they're doing.
p158
aVThe net effect of that is that our people
p159
aVwho are overseas in dangerous places,
p160
aVwhether they're diplomats or military,
p161
aVand our allies who are in similar situations,
p162
aVare at greater risk because we don't see
p163
aVthe threats that are coming their way.
p164
aa(lp165
VCA: So that's a general response saying that
p166
aVbecause of his revelations,
p167
aVaccess that you had to certain types of information
p168
aVhas been shut down, has been closed down.
p169
aVBut the concern is that the nature of that access
p170
aVwas not necessarily legitimate in the first place.
p171
aVI mean, describe to us this Bullrun program
p172
aVwhere it's alleged that the NSA
p173
aVspecifically weakened security
p174
aVin order to get the type of  access that you've spoken of.
p175
aa(lp176
VRL: So there are, when our
p177
aVlegitimate foreign intelligence targets of the type that I described before,
p178
aVuse the global telecommunications system
p179
aVas their communications methodology,
p180
aVand they do, because it's a great system,
p181
aVit's the most complex system ever devised by man,
p182
aVand it is a wonder,
p183
aVand lots of folks in the room there
p184
aVare responsible for the creation
p185
aVand enhancement of that,
p186
aVand it's just a wonderful thing.
p187
aVBut it's also used by people who are
p188
aVworking against us and our allies.
p189
aVAnd so if I'm going to pursue them,
p190
aVI need to have the capability
p191
aVto go after them,
p192
aVand again, the controls are in
p193
aVhow I apply that capability,
p194
aVnot that I have the capability itself.
p195
aVOtherwise, if we could make it so that
p196
aVall the bad guys used one corner of the Internet,
p197
aVwe could have a domain, badguy.com.
p198
aVThat would be awesome,
p199
aVand we could just concentrate all our efforts there.
p200
aVThat's not how it works.
p201
aVThey're trying to hide
p202
aVfrom the government's ability
p203
aVto isolate and interdict their actions,
p204
aVand so we have to swim in that same space.
p205
aVBut I will tell you this.
p206
aVSo NSA has two missions.
p207
aVOne is the Signals Intelligence mission
p208
aVthat we've unfortunately read so much about in the press.
p209
aVThe other one is the Information Assurance mission,
p210
aVwhich is to protect the national security systems of the United States,
p211
aVand by that, that's things like
p212
aVthe communications that the president uses,
p213
aVthe communications that control our nuclear weapons,
p214
aVthe communications that our military uses around the world,
p215
aVand the communications that we use with our allies,
p216
aVand that some of our allies themselves use.
p217
aVAnd so we make recommendations on standards to use,
p218
aVand we use those same standards,
p219
aVand so we are invested
p220
aVin making sure that those communications
p221
aVare secure for their intended purposes.
p222
aa(lp223
VCA: But it sounds like what you're saying is that
p224
aVwhen it comes to the Internet at large,
p225
aVany strategy is fair game
p226
aVif it improves America's safety.
p227
aVAnd I think this is partly where there is such
p228
aVa divide of opinion,
p229
aVthat there's a lot of people in this room
p230
aVand around the world
p231
aVwho think very differently about the Internet.
p232
aVThey think of it as a momentous
p233
aVinvention of humanity,
p234
aVkind of on a par with the Gutenberg press, for example.
p235
aVIt's the bringer of knowledge to all.
p236
aVIt's the connector of all.
p237
aVAnd it's viewed in those sort of idealistic terms.
p238
aVAnd from that lens,
p239
aVwhat the NSA has done is equivalent to
p240
aVthe authorities back in Germany
p241
aVinserting some device into every printing press
p242
aVthat would reveal which books people bought
p243
aVand what they read.
p244
aVCan you understand that from that viewpoint,
p245
aVit feels outrageous?
p246
aa(lp247
VRL: I do understand that, and I actually share the view of the utility of the Internet,
p248
aVand I would argue it's bigger than the Internet.
p249
aVIt is a global telecommunications system.
p250
aVThe Internet is a big chunk of  that, but there is a lot more.
p251
aVAnd I think that people have legitimate concerns
p252
aVabout the balance between transparency and secrecy.
p253
aVThat's sort of been couched as a balance
p254
aVbetween privacy and national security.
p255
aVI don't think that's the right framing.
p256
aVI think it really is transparency and secrecy.
p257
aVAnd so that's the national and international conversation that we're having,
p258
aVand we want to participate in that, and want
p259
aVpeople to participate in it in an informed way.
p260
aVSo there are things,
p261
aVlet me talk there a little bit more,
p262
aVthere are things that we need to be transparent about:
p263
aVour authorities, our processes,
p264
aVour oversight, who we are.
p265
aVWe, NSA, have not done a good job of that,
p266
aVand I think that's part of the reason
p267
aVthat this has been so revelational
p268
aVand so sensational in the media.
p269
aVNobody knew who we were. We were the No Such Agency, the Never Say Anything.
p270
aVThere's takeoffs of our logo
p271
aVof an eagle with headphones on around it.
p272
aVAnd so that's the public characterization.
p273
aVAnd so we need to be more transparent about those things.
p274
aVWhat we don't need to be transparent about,
p275
aVbecause it's bad for the U.S.,
p276
aVit's bad for all those other countries that we work with
p277
aVand that we help provide information
p278
aVthat helps them secure themselves
p279
aVand their people,
p280
aVit's bad to expose operations and capabilities
p281
aVin a way that allows the people that we're all working against,
p282
aVthe generally recognized bad guys,
p283
aVto counter those.
p284
aa(lp285
VCA: But isn't it also bad to deal
p286
aVa kind of body blow to the American companies
p287
aVthat have essentially given the world
p288
aVmost of the Internet services that matter?
p289
aVRL: It is. It's really the companies are
p290
aVin a tough position, as are we,
p291
aVbecause the companies,
p292
aVwe compel them to provide information,
p293
aVjust like every other nation in the world does.
p294
aVEvery industrialized nation in the world
p295
aVhas a lawful intercept program
p296
aVwhere they are requiring companies
p297
aVto provide them with information
p298
aVthat they need for their security,
p299
aVand the companies that are involved
p300
aVhave complied with those programs
p301
aVin the same way that they have to do
p302
aVwhen they're operating in Russia or the U.K.
p303
aVor China or India or France,
p304
aVany country that you choose to name.
p305
aVAnd so the fact that these revelations
p306
aVhave been broadly characterized as
p307
aV"you can't trust company A because
p308
aVyour privacy is suspect with them"
p309
aVis actually only accurate in the sense that
p310
aVit's accurate with every other company in the world
p311
aVthat deals with any of those countries in the world.
p312
aVAnd so it's being picked up by people
p313
aVas a marketing advantage,
p314
aVand it's being marketed that  way by several countries,
p315
aVincluding some of our allied countries,
p316
aVwhere they are saying,
p317
aV"Hey, you can't trust the U.S.,
p318
aVbut you can trust our telecom company,
p319
aVbecause we're safe."
p320
aVAnd they're actually using that to counter
p321
aVthe very large technological edge
p322
aVthat U.S. companies have
p323
aVin areas like the cloud and Internet-based technologies.
p324
aa(lp325
VCA: You're sitting there with the American flag,
p326
aVand the American Constitution guarantees
p327
aVfreedom from unreasonable search and seizure.
p328
aVHow do you characterize
p329
aVthe American citizen's right to privacy?
p330
aVIs there such a right?
p331
aa(lp332
VRL: Yeah, of course there is.
p333
aVAnd we devote an inordinate amount of time and pressure,
p334
aVinordinate and appropriate, actually I should say,
p335
aVamount of time and effort in order to ensure
p336
aVthat we protect that privacy.
p337
aVand beyond that, the privacy of citizens
p338
aVaround the world, it's not just Americans.
p339
aVSeveral things come into play here.
p340
aVFirst, we're all in the same network.
p341
aVMy communications,
p342
aVI'm a user of a particular Internet email service
p343
aVthat is the number one email service of choice
p344
aVby terrorists around the world, number one.
p345
aVSo I'm there right beside them in email space
p346
aVin the Internet.
p347
aVAnd so we need to be able to pick that apart
p348
aVand find the information that's relevant.
p349
aVIn doing so, we're going to necessarily encounter
p350
aVAmericans and innocent foreign citizens
p351
aVwho are just going about their business,
p352
aVand so we have procedures in place that shreds that out,
p353
aVthat says, when you find that,
p354
aVnot if you find it, when you find it, because you're certain to find it,
p355
aVhere's how you protect that.
p356
aVThese are called minimization procedures.
p357
aVThey're approved by the attorney general
p358
aVand constitutionally based.
p359
aVAnd so we protect those.
p360
aVAnd then, for people, citizens of the world
p361
aVwho are going about their lawful business
p362
aVon a day-to-day basis,
p363
aVthe president on his January 17 speech,
p364
aVlaid out some additional protections
p365
aVthat we are providing to them.
p366
aVSo I think absolutely,
p367
aVfolks do have a right to privacy,
p368
aVand that we work very hard to make sure
p369
aVthat that right to privacy is protected.
p370
aa(lp371
VCA: What about foreigners using
p372
aVAmerican companies' Internet services?
p373
aVDo they have any privacy rights?
p374
aa(lp375
VRL: They do. They do, in the sense of,
p376
aVthe only way that we are able to compel
p377
aVone of those companies to provide us information
p378
aVis when it falls into one of three categories:
p379
aVWe can identify that this particular person,
p380
aVidentified by a selector of some kind,
p381
aVis associated with counterterrorist
p382
aVor proliferation or other foreign intelligence target.
p383
aa(lp384
VCA: Much has been made of the fact that
p385
aVa lot of the information that you've obtained
p386
aVthrough these programs is essentially metadata.
p387
aVIt's not necessarily the actual words
p388
aVthat someone has written in an email
p389
aVor given on a phone call.
p390
aVIt's who they wrote to and when, and so forth.
p391
aVBut it's been argued,
p392
aVand someone here in the audience has talked
p393
aVto a former NSA analyst who said
p394
aVmetadata is actually much more invasive
p395
aVthan the core data,
p396
aVbecause in the core data
p397
aVyou present yourself as you want to be presented.
p398
aVWith metadata, who knows what the conclusions are
p399
aVthat are drawn?
p400
aVIs there anything to that?
p401
aa(lp402
VRL: I don't really understand that argument.
p403
aVI think that metadata's important for a couple of reasons.
p404
aVMetadata is the information that lets you
p405
aVfind connections that people are trying to hide.
p406
aVSo when a terrorist is corresponding
p407
aVwith somebody else who's not known to us
p408
aVbut is engaged in doing or supporting terrorist activity,
p409
aVor someone who's violating international sanctions
p410
aVby providing nuclear weapons-related material
p411
aVto a country like Iran or North Korea,
p412
aVis trying to hide that activity because it's illicit activity.
p413
aVWhat metadata lets you do is connect that.
p414
aVThe alternative to that
p415
aVis one that's much less efficient
p416
aVand much more invasive of privacy,
p417
aVwhich is gigantic amounts of content collection.
p418
aVSo metadata, in that sense,
p419
aVactually is privacy-enhancing.
p420
aVAnd we don't, contrary to some of the stuff
p421
aVthat's been printed,
p422
aVwe don't sit there and grind out
p423
aVmetadata profiles of average people.
p424
aVIf you're not connected
p425
aVto one of those valid intelligence targets,
p426
aVyou are not of interest to us.
p427
aa(lp428
VCA: So in terms of the threats
p429
aVthat face America overall,
p430
aVwhere would you place terrorism?
p431
aa(lp432
VRL: I think terrorism is still number one.
p433
aVI think that we have never been in a time
p434
aVwhere there are more places
p435
aVwhere things are going badly
p436
aVand forming the petri dish in which terrorists
p437
aVtake advantage of the lack of governance.
p438
aVAn old boss of mine, Tom Fargo, Admiral Fargo,
p439
aVused to describe it as arcs of instability.
p440
aVAnd so you have a lot of those arcs of instability
p441
aVin the world right now,
p442
aVin places like Syria, where there's a civil war
p443
aVgoing on and you have massive numbers,
p444
aVthousands and thousands of foreign fighters
p445
aVwho are coming into Syria
p446
aVto learn how to be terrorists
p447
aVand practice that activity,
p448
aVand lots of those people are Westerners
p449
aVwho hold passports to European countries
p450
aVor in some cases the United States,
p451
aVand so they are basically learning how
p452
aVto do jihad and have expressed intent
p453
aVto go out and do that later on
p454
aVin their home countries.
p455
aVYou've got places like Iraq,
p456
aVwhich is suffering from a high level of sectarian violence,
p457
aVagain a breeding ground for terrorism.
p458
aVAnd you have the activity in the Horn of Africa
p459
aVand the Sahel area of Africa.
p460
aVAgain, lots of weak governance
p461
aVwhich forms a breeding ground for terrorist activity.
p462
aVSo I think it's very serious. I think it's number one.
p463
aVI think number two is cyber threat.
p464
aVI think cyber is a threat in three ways:
p465
aVOne way, and probably the most common way
p466
aVthat people have heard about it,
p467
aVis due to the theft of intellectual property,
p468
aVso basically, foreign countries going in,
p469
aVstealing companies' secrets,
p470
aVand then providing that information
p471
aVto state-owned enterprises
p472
aVor companies connected to the government
p473
aVto help them leapfrog technology
p474
aVor to gain business intelligence
p475
aVthat's then used to win contracts overseas.
p476
aVThat is a hugely costly set of activities that's going on right now.
p477
aVSeveral nation-states are doing it.
p478
aVSecond is the denial-of-service attacks.
p479
aVYou're probably aware that there have been
p480
aVa spate of those directed against
p481
aVthe U.S. financial sector since 2012.
p482
aVAgain, that's a nation-state who is executing those attacks,
p483
aVand they're doing that
p484
aVas a semi-anonymous way of reprisal.
p485
aVAnd the last one is destructive attacks,
p486
aVand those are the ones that concern me the most.
p487
aVThose are on the rise.
p488
aVYou have the attack against Saudi Aramco in 2012,
p489
aVAugust of 2012.
p490
aVIt took down about 35,000 of their computers
p491
aVwith a Wiper-style virus.
p492
aVYou had a follow-on a week later
p493
aVto a Qatari company.
p494
aVYou had March of 2013,
p495
aVyou had a South Korean attack
p496
aVthat was attributed in the press to North Korea
p497
aVthat took out thousands of computers.
p498
aVThose are on the rise,
p499
aVand we see people expressing interest
p500
aVin those capabilities
p501
aVand a desire to employ them.
p502
aa(lp503
VCA: Okay, so a couple of things here,
p504
aVbecause this is really the core of this, almost.
p505
aVI mean, first of all,
p506
aVa lot of people who look at risk
p507
aVand look at the numbers
p508
aVdon't understand this belief that terrorism
p509
aVis still the number one threat.
p510
aVApart from September 11,
p511
aVI think the numbers are that in the last 30 or 40 years
p512
aVabout 500 Americans have died from terrorism,
p513
aVmostly from homegrown terrorists.
p514
aVThe chance in the last few years
p515
aVof being killed by terrorism
p516
aVis far less than the chance of being killed by lightning.
p517
aVI guess you would say that a single nuclear incident
p518
aVor bioterrorism act or something like that
p519
aVwould change those numbers.
p520
aVWould that be the point of view?
p521
aa(lp522
VRL: Well, I'd say two things.
p523
aVOne is, the reason that there hasn't been
p524
aVa major attack in the United States since 9/11,
p525
aVthat is not an accident.
p526
aVThat's a lot of hard work that we have done,
p527
aVthat other folks
p528
aVin the intelligence community have done,
p529
aVthat the military has done,
p530
aVand that our allies around the globe have done.
p531
aVYou've heard the numbers about
p532
aVthe tip of the iceberg in terms
p533
aVof numbers of terrorist attacks that NSA programs
p534
aVcontributed to stopping was 54,
p535
aV25 of those in Europe,
p536
aVand of those 25,
p537
aV18 of them occurred in three countries,
p538
aVsome of which are our allies,
p539
aVand some of which are beating the heck out of us
p540
aVover the NSA programs, by the way.
p541
aVSo that's not an accident that those things happen.
p542
aVThat's hard work. That's us finding intelligence
p543
aVon terrorist activities
p544
aVand interdicting them through one way or another,
p545
aVthrough law enforcement,
p546
aVthrough cooperative activities with other countries
p547
aVand sometimes through military action.
p548
aVThe other thing I would say is that
p549
aVyour idea of nuclear or chem-bio-threat
p550
aVis not at all far-fetched
p551
aVand in fact there are a number of groups
p552
aVwho have for several years expressed interest
p553
aVand desire in obtaining those capabilities
p554
aVand work towards that.
p555
aa(lp556
VCA: It's also been said that,
p557
aVof those 54 alleged incidents,
p558
aVthat as few as zero of them
p559
aVwere actually anything to do
p560
aVwith these controversial programs
p561
aVthat Mr. Snowden revealed,
p562
aVthat it was basically through other forms of intelligence,
p563
aVthat you're looking for a needle in a haystack,
p564
aVand the effects of these programs,
p565
aVthese controversial programs,
p566
aVis just to add hay to the stack,
p567
aVnot to really find the needle.
p568
aVThe needle was found by other methods.
p569
aVIsn't there something to that?
p570
aa(lp571
VRL: No, there's actually two programs
p572
aVthat are typically implicated in that discussion.
p573
aVOne is the section 215 program,
p574
aVthe U.S. telephony metadata program,
p575
aVand the other one is
p576
aVpopularly called the PRISM program,
p577
aVand it's actually section 702  of the FISA Amendment Act.
p578
aVBut the 215 program
p579
aVis only relevant to threats
p580
aVthat are directed against the United States,
p581
aVand there have been a dozen threats
p582
aVwhere that was implicated.
p583
aVNow what you'll see people say publicly
p584
aVis there is no "but for" case,
p585
aVand so there is no case where, but for that,
p586
aVthe threat would have happened.
p587
aVBut that actually indicates a lack of understanding
p588
aVof how terrorist investigations actually work.
p589
aVYou think about on television,
p590
aVyou watch a murder mystery.
p591
aVWhat do you start with? You start with a body,
p592
aVand then they work their way from there to solve the crime.
p593
aVWe're actually starting well before that,
p594
aVhopefully before there are any bodies,
p595
aVand we're trying to build the case for
p596
aVwho the people are, what they're trying to do,
p597
aVand that involves massive amounts of information.
p598
aVThink of it is as mosaic,
p599
aVand it's hard to say that any one piece of a mosaic
p600
aVwas necessary to building the mosaic,
p601
aVbut to build the complete picture,
p602
aVyou need to have all the pieces of information.
p603
aVOn the other, the non-U.S.-related threats out of those 54,
p604
aVthe other 42 of them,
p605
aVthe PRISM program was hugely relevant to that,
p606
aVand in fact was material in contributing
p607
aVto stopping those attacks.
p608
aa(lp609
VCA: Snowden said two days ago
p610
aVthat terrorism has always been
p611
aVwhat is called in the intelligence world
p612
aV"a cover for action,"
p613
aVthat it's something that,
p614
aVbecause it invokes such a powerful
p615
aVemotional response in people,
p616
aVit allows the initiation of these programs
p617
aVto achieve powers that an organization like yours
p618
aVcouldn't otherwise have.
p619
aVIs there any internal debate about that?
p620
aa(lp621
VRL: Yeah.
p622
aVI mean, we debate these things all the time,
p623
aVand there is discussion that goes on
p624
aVin the executive branch
p625
aVand within NSA itself
p626
aVand the intelligence community about
p627
aVwhat's right, what's proportionate,
p628
aVwhat's the correct thing to do.
p629
aVAnd it's important to note that the programs
p630
aVthat we're talking about
p631
aVwere all authorized by two different presidents,
p632
aVtwo different political parties,
p633
aVby Congress twice,
p634
aVand by federal judges 16 different times,
p635
aVand so this is not NSA running off
p636
aVand doing its own thing.
p637
aVThis is a legitimate activity
p638
aVof the United States foreign government
p639
aVthat was agreed to by all the branches
p640
aVof the United States government,
p641
aVand President Madison would have been proud.
p642
aa(lp643
VCA: And yet, when congressmen discovered
p644
aVwhat was actually being done  with that authorization,
p645
aVmany of them were completely shocked.
p646
aVOr do you think that is not a legitimate reaction,
p647
aVthat it's only because it's now come out publicly,
p648
aVthat they really knew exactly what you were doing
p649
aVwith the powers they had granted you?
p650
aa(lp651
VRL: Congress is a big body.
p652
aVThere's 535 of them,
p653
aVand they change out frequently,
p654
aVin the case of the House, every two years,
p655
aVand I think that the NSA provided
p656
aVall the relevant information to our oversight committees,
p657
aVand then the dissemination of that information
p658
aVby the oversight committees throughout Congress
p659
aVis something that they manage.
p660
aVI think I would say that Congress members
p661
aVhad the opportunity to make themselves aware,
p662
aVand in fact a significant number of them,
p663
aVthe ones who are assigned oversight responsibility,
p664
aVdid have the ability to do that.
p665
aVAnd you've actually had the chairs of those committees say that in public.
p666
aVCA: Now, you mentioned the  threat of cyberattacks,
p667
aVand I don't think anyone in this room would disagree
p668
aVthat that is a huge concern,
p669
aVbut do you accept that there's a tradeoff
p670
aVbetween offensive and defensive strategies,
p671
aVand that it's possible that the very measures taken
p672
aVto, "weaken encryption,"
p673
aVand allow yourself to find the bad guys,
p674
aVmight also open the door to forms of cyberattack?
p675
aa(lp676
VRL: So I think two things.
p677
aVOne is, you said weaken encryption. I didn't.
p678
aVAnd the other one is that
p679
aVthe NSA has both of those missions,
p680
aVand we are heavily biased towards defense,
p681
aVand, actually, the vulnerabilities that we find
p682
aVin the overwhelming majority of cases,
p683
aVwe disclose to the people who are responsible
p684
aVfor manufacturing or developing those products.
p685
aVWe have a great track record of that,
p686
aVand we're actually working on a proposal right now
p687
aVto be transparent and to publish transparency reports
p688
aVin the same way that the Internet companies
p689
aVare being allowed to publish transparency reports for them.
p690
aVWe want to be more transparent about that.
p691
aVSo again, we eat our own dog food.
p692
aVWe use the standards, we use the products
p693
aVthat we recommend,
p694
aVand so it's in our interest
p695
aVto keep our communications protected
p696
aVin the same way that other people's need to be.
p697
aa(lp698
VCA: Edward Snowden,
p699
aVwhen, after his talk, was wandering the halls here
p700
aVin the bot,
p701
aVand I heard him say to a couple of people,
p702
aVthey asked him about what he thought
p703
aVof the NSA overall,
p704
aVand he was very complimentary about the people
p705
aVwho work with you,
p706
aVsaid that it's a really
p707
aVimpassioned group of employees
p708
aVwho are seeking to do the right thing,
p709
aVand that the problems have come from
p710
aVjust some badly conceived policies.
p711
aVHe came over certainly very reasonably and calmly.
p712
aVHe didn't come over like a crazy man.
p713
aVWould you accept that at least,
p714
aVeven if you disagree with how he did it,
p715
aVthat he has opened a debate that matters?
p716
aa(lp717
VRL: So I think that the discussion
p718
aVis an important one to have.
p719
aVI do not like the way that he did it.
p720
aVI think there were a number of other ways
p721
aVthat he could have done that
p722
aVthat would have not endangered our people
p723
aVand the people of other nations
p724
aVthrough losing visibility
p725
aVinto what our adversaries are doing.
p726
aVBut I do think it's an important conversation.
p727
aa(lp728
VCA: It's been reported that there's
p729
aValmost a difference of opinion
p730
aVwith you and your colleagues
p731
aVover any scenario in which
p732
aVhe might be offered an amnesty deal.
p733
aVI think your boss, General Keith Alexander,
p734
aVhas said that that would be a terrible example
p735
aVfor others;
p736
aVyou can't negotiate with someone
p737
aVwho's broken the law in that way.
p738
aVBut you've been quoted as saying that,
p739
aVif Snowden could prove that he was surrendering
p740
aVall undisclosed documents,
p741
aVthat a deal maybe should be considered.
p742
aVDo you still think that?
p743
aa(lp744
VRL: Yeah, so actually,
p745
aVthis is my favorite thing about that "60 Minutes" interview
p746
aVwas all the misquotes that came from that.
p747
aVWhat I actually said, in  response to a question about,
p748
aVwould you entertain any discussions
p749
aVof mitigating action against Snowden,
p750
aVI said, yeah, it's worth a conversation.
p751
aVThis is something that the attorney general
p752
aVof the United States and the president also
p753
aVactually have both talked about this,
p754
aVand I defer to the attorney general,
p755
aVbecause this is his lane.
p756
aVBut there is a strong tradition
p757
aVin American jurisprudence
p758
aVof having discussions with people
p759
aVwho have been charged with crimes in order to,
p760
aVif it benefits the government,
p761
aVto get something out of that,
p762
aVthat there's always room for that kind of discussion.
p763
aVSo I'm not presupposing any outcome,
p764
aVbut there is always room for discussion.
p765
aa(lp766
VCA: To a lay person it seems like
p767
aVhe has certain things to offer the U.S.,
p768
aVthe government, you, others,
p769
aVin terms of putting things right
p770
aVand helping figure out a smarter policy,
p771
aVa smarter way forward for the future.
p772
aVDo you see, has that kind of possibility
p773
aVbeen entertained at all?
p774
aVRL: So that's out of my lane.
p775
aVThat's not an NSA thing.
p776
aVThat would be a Department of Justice
p777
aVsort of discussion.
p778
aVI'll defer to them.
p779
aa(lp780
VCA: Rick, when Ed Snowden ended his talk,
p781
aVI offered him the chance to share an idea worth spreading.
p782
aVWhat would be your idea worth spreading
p783
aVfor this group?
p784
aa(lp785
VRL: So I think, learn the facts.
p786
aVThis is a really important conversation,
p787
aVand it impacts, it's not just NSA,
p788
aVit's not just the government,
p789
aVit's you, it's the Internet companies.
p790
aVThe issue of privacy and personal data
p791
aVis much bigger than just the government,
p792
aVand so learn the facts.
p793
aVDon't rely on headlines,
p794
aVdon't rely on sound bites,
p795
aVdon't rely on one-sided conversations.
p796
aVSo that's the idea, I think, worth spreading.
p797
aVWe have a sign, a badge tab,
p798
aVwe wear badges at work with lanyards,
p799
aVand if I could make a plug,
p800
aVmy badge lanyard at work says, "Dallas Cowboys."
p801
aVGo Dallas.
p802
aVI've just alienated half the audience, I know.
p803
aVSo the lanyard that our people
p804
aVwho work in the organization
p805
aVthat does our crypto-analytic work
p806
aVhave a tab that says, "Look at the data."
p807
aVSo that's the idea worth spreading.
p808
aVLook at the data.
p809
aa(lp810
VCA: Rick, it took a certain amount of courage,
p811
aVI think, actually, to come and speak openly
p812
aVto this group.
p813
aVIt's not something the NSA has done a lot of in the past,
p814
aVand plus the technology has been challenging.
p815
aVWe truly appreciate you doing that
p816
aVand sharing in this very important conversation.
p817
aVThank you so much.
p818
aa(lp819
VRL: Thanks, Chris.

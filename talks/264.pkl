VThe first question is this.
p5
aVOur country has two exploration programs.
p6
aVOne is NASA, with a mission to explore the great beyond,
p7
aVto explore the heavens, which we all want to go to if we're lucky.
p8
aVAnd you can see we have Sputnik, and we have Saturn,
p9
aVand we have other manifestations of space exploration.
p10
aVWell, there's also another program,
p11
aVin another agency within our government, in ocean exploration.
p12
aVIt's in NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
p13
aVAnd my question is this: "why are we ignoring the oceans?"
p14
aVHere's the reason, or not the reason, but here's why I ask that question.
p15
aVIf you compare NASA's annual budget to explore the heavens,
p16
aVthat one-year budget would fund NOAA's budget
p17
aVto explore the oceans for 1,600 years.
p18
aVWhy? Why are we looking up? Is it because it's heaven?
p19
aVAnd hell is down here? Is it a cultural issue?
p20
aVWhy are people afraid of the ocean?
p21
aVOr do they just assume the ocean is just a dark, gloomy place
p22
aVthat has nothing to offer?
p23
aa(lp24
VI'm going to take you on a 16-minute trip on 72 percent of the planet, so buckle up.
p25
aVOK. And what we're going to do
p26
aVis we're going to immerse ourselves in my world.
p27
aVAnd what I'm going to try \u2014 I hope I make the following points.
p28
aVI'm going to make it right now in case I forget.
p29
aVEverything I'm going to present to you
p30
aVwas not in my textbooks when I went to school.
p31
aVAnd most of all, it was not even in my college textbooks.
p32
aVI'm a geophysicist, and all my Earth science books when I was a student \u2014
p33
aVI had to give the wrong answer to get an A.
p34
aVWe used to ridicule continental drift. It was something we laughed at.
p35
aVWe learned of Marshall Kay's geosynclinal cycle, which is a bunch of crap.
p36
aVIn today's context, it was a bunch of crap,
p37
aVbut it was the law of geology, vertical tectonics.
p38
aVAll the things we're going to walk through
p39
aVin our explorations and discoveries of the oceans
p40
aVwere mostly discoveries made by accident.
p41
aVMostly discoveries made by accident.
p42
aVWe were looking for something and found something else.
p43
aVAnd everything we're going to talk about
p44
aVrepresents a one tenth of one percent glimpse, because that's all we've seen.
p45
aa(lp46
VI have a characterization.
p47
aVThis is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water.
p48
aVIt gives you the false impression it's a map.
p49
aVIt is not a map.
p50
aVIn fact, I have another version at my office
p51
aVand I ask people, "Why are there mountains here, on this area here,
p52
aVbut there are none over here?" And they go, "Well, gee,
p53
aVI don't know," saying,
p54
aV"Is it a fracture zone? Is it a hot spot?"
p55
aVNo, no, that's the only place a ship's been.
p56
aVMost of the southern hemisphere is unexplored.
p57
aVWe had more exploration ships down there
p58
aVduring Captain Cook's time than now. It's amazing.
p59
aVAll right. So we're going to immerse ourselves
p60
aVin the 72 percent of the planet because, you know,
p61
aVit's really naive to think that the Easter Bunny
p62
aVput all the resources on the continents.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VYou know, it's just ludicrous.
p67
aVWe are always, constantly playing the zero sum game.
p68
aVYou know, we're going to do this, we're going to take it away from something else.
p69
aVI believe in just enriching the economy.
p70
aVAnd we're leaving so much on the table, 72 percent of the planet.
p71
aVAnd as I will point out later in the presentation,
p72
aV50 percent of the United States of America lies beneath the sea.
p73
aV50 percent of our country that we own, have all legal jurisdiction,
p74
aVhave all rights to do whatever we want, lies beneath the sea
p75
aVand we have better maps of Mars than that 50 percent.
p76
aVWhy? OK. Now, I began my explorations the hard way.
p77
aVBack then \u2014 actually my first expedition
p78
aVwas when I was 17 years old. It was 49 years ago.
p79
aVDo the math, I'm 66. And I went out to sea on a Scripps ship
p80
aVand we almost got sunk by a giant rogue wave,
p81
aVand I was too young to be \u2014 you know, I thought it was great!
p82
aVI was a body surfer and I thought, "Wow, that was an incredible wave!"
p83
aVAnd we almost sank the ship, but I became enraptured
p84
aVwith mounting expeditions. And over the last 49 years,
p85
aVI've done about 120, 121 \u2014 I keep doing them \u2014 expeditions.
p86
aa(lp87
VBut in the early days, the only way I could get to the bottom
p88
aVwas to crawl into a submarine, a very small submarine,
p89
aVand go down to the bottom.
p90
aVI dove in a whole series of different deep diving submersibles.
p91
aVAlvin and Sea Cliff and Cyana,
p92
aVand all the major deep submersibles we have, which are about eight.
p93
aVIn fact, on a good day, we might have four or five human beings
p94
aVat the average depth of the Earth \u2014
p95
aVmaybe four or five human beings out of whatever billions we've got going.
p96
aVAnd so it's very difficult to get there, if you do it physically.
p97
aVBut I was enraptured, and in my graduate years
p98
aVwas the dawn of plate tectonics. And we realized
p99
aVthat the greatest mountain range on Earth lies beneath the sea.
p100
aa(lp101
VThe mid-ocean ridge runs around like the seam on a baseball.
p102
aVThis is on a Mercator projection.
p103
aVBut if you were to put it on an equal area projection,
p104
aVyou'd see that the mid-ocean ridge covers 23 percent
p105
aVof the Earth's total surface area.
p106
aVAlmost a quarter of our planet is a single mountain range
p107
aVand we didn't enter it until after Neil Armstrong
p108
aVand Buzz Aldrin went to the moon.
p109
aVSo we went to the moon, played golf up there,
p110
aVbefore we went to the largest feature on our own planet.
p111
aVAnd our interest in this mountain range, as Earth scientists in those days,
p112
aVwas not only because of its tremendous size, dominating the planet,
p113
aVbut the role it plays in the genesis of the Earth's outer skin.
p114
aVBecause it's along the axis of the mid-ocean ridge
p115
aVwhere the great crustal plates are separating.
p116
aVAnd like a living organism, you tear it open,
p117
aVit bleeds its molten blood, rises up to heal that wound
p118
aVfrom the asthenosphere, hardens, forms new tissue and moves laterally.
p119
aa(lp120
VBut no one had actually gone down
p121
aVinto the actual site of the boundary of creation as we call it \u2014
p122
aVinto the Rift Valley \u2014 until a group of seven of us
p123
aVcrawled in our little submarines in the summer of 1973, 1974
p124
aVand were the first human beings to enter the Great Rift Valley.
p125
aVWe went down into the Rift Valley.
p126
aVThis is all accurate except for one thing \u2014 it's pitch black.
p127
aVIt's absolutely pitch black, because
p128
aVphotons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean,
p129
aVwhich is 12,000 feet. In the Rift Valley, it's 9,000 feet.
p130
aVMost of our planet does not feel the warmth of the sun.
p131
aVMost of our planet is in eternal darkness.
p132
aVAnd for that reason, you do not have photosynthesis in the deep sea.
p133
aVAnd with the absence of photosynthesis
p134
aVyou have no plant life, and as a result,
p135
aVyou have very little animal life living in this underworld.
p136
aVOr so we thought. And so in our initial explorations,
p137
aVwe were totally focused on exploring the boundary of creation,
p138
aVlooking at the volcanic features running along that entire 42,000 miles.
p139
aVRunning along this entire 42,000 miles
p140
aVare tens of thousands of active volcanoes.
p141
aVTens of thousands of active volcanoes.
p142
aVThere are more active volcanoes beneath the sea
p143
aVthan on land by two orders of magnitude.
p144
aVSo, it's a phenomenally active region,
p145
aVit's not just a dark, boring place. It's a very alive place.
p146
aVAnd it's then being ripped open.
p147
aa(lp148
VBut we were dealing with a particular scientific issue back then.
p149
aVWe couldn't understand why you had a mountain under tension.
p150
aVIn plate tectonic theory, we knew that if you had plates collide,
p151
aVit made sense: they would crush into one another,
p152
aVyou would thicken the crust, you'd uplift it.
p153
aVThat's why you get, you know, you get seashells up on Mount Everest.
p154
aVIt's not a flood, it was pushed up there.
p155
aVWe understood mountains under compression,
p156
aVbut we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension.
p157
aVIt should not be. Until one of my colleagues said,
p158
aV"It looks to me like a thermal blister, and the mid-ocean ridge
p159
aVmust be a cooling curve." We said, "Let's go find out."
p160
aVWe punched a bunch of heat probes. Everything made sense,
p161
aVexcept, at the axis, there was missing heat. It was missing heat.
p162
aVIt was hot. It wasn't hot enough.
p163
aVSo, we came up with multiple hypotheses:
p164
aVthere's little green people down there taking it;
p165
aVthere's all sorts of things going on.
p166
aVBut the only logical [explanation] was that there were hot springs.
p167
aVSo, there must be underwater hot springs.
p168
aa(lp169
VWe mounted an expedition to look for the missing heat.
p170
aVAnd so we went along this mountain range, in an area along Galapagos Rift,
p171
aVand did we find the missing heat.
p172
aVIt was amazing. These giant chimneys, huge giant chimneys.
p173
aVWe went up to them with our submersible.
p174
aVWe wanted to get a temperature probe, we stuck it in there,
p175
aVlooked at it \u2014 it pegged off scale.
p176
aVThe pilot made this great observation: "That's hot."
p177
aa(lp178
V(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VAnd then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff \u2014
p181
aVit could have melted. But it turns out the exiting temperature
p182
aVwas 650 degrees F, hot enough to melt lead.
p183
aVThis is what a real one looks like, on the Juan de Fuca Ridge.
p184
aVWhat you're looking at is an incredible pipe organ
p185
aVof chemicals coming out of the ocean.
p186
aVEverything you see in this picture is commercial grade:
p187
aVcopper, lead, silver, zinc and gold.
p188
aVSo the Easter Bunny has put things in the ocean floor,
p189
aVand you have massive heavy metal deposits
p190
aVthat we're making in this mountain range.
p191
aVWe're making huge discoveries of large commercial-grade ore
p192
aValong this mountain range, but it was dwarfed by what we discovered.
p193
aVWe discovered a profusion of life,
p194
aVin a world that it should not exist [in]. Giant tube worms, 10 feet tall.
p195
aVI remember having to use vodka \u2014 my own vodka \u2014 to pickle it
p196
aVbecause we don't carry formaldehyde.
p197
aVWe went and found these incredible clam beds
p198
aVsitting on the barren rock. Large clams,
p199
aVand when we opened them, they didn't look like a clam.
p200
aVAnd when we cut them open, they didn't have the anatomy of a clam.
p201
aVNo mouth, no gut, no digestive system.
p202
aVTheir bodies had been totally taken over
p203
aVby another organism, a bacterium, that had figured out
p204
aVhow to replicate photosynthesis in the dark,
p205
aVthrough a process we now call chemosynthesis.
p206
aVNone of it in our textbooks. None of this in our textbooks.
p207
aVWe did not know about this life system.
p208
aVWe were not predicting it.
p209
aVWe stumbled on it, looking for some missing heat.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo, we wanted to accelerate this process.
p212
aVWe wanted to get away from this silly trip, up and down on a submarine:
p213
aVaverage depth of the ocean, 12,000 feet;
p214
aVtwo and half hours to get to work in the morning;
p215
aVtwo and half hours to get to home. Five hour commute to work.
p216
aVThree hours of bottom time, average distance traveled \u2014 one mile.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VOn a 42,000 mile mountain range. Great job security, but not the way to go.
p221
aVSo, I began designing a new technology of telepresence,
p222
aVusing robotic systems to replicate myself,
p223
aVso I wouldn't have to cycle my vehicle system.
p224
aVWe began to introduce that in our explorations,
p225
aVand we continued to make phenomenal discoveries
p226
aVwith our new robotic technologies. Again, looking for something else,
p227
aVmoving from one part of the mid-ocean ridge to another.
p228
aVThe scientists were off watch and they came across incredible life forms.
p229
aVThey came across new creatures they had not seen before.
p230
aVBut more importantly, they discovered
p231
aVedifices down there that they did not understand.
p232
aVThat did not make sense. They were not above a magma chamber.
p233
aVThey shouldn't be there. And we called it Lost City.
p234
aa(lp235
VAnd Lost City was characterized by these incredible limestone formations
p236
aVand upside down pools. Look at that.
p237
aVHow do you do that? That's water upside down.
p238
aVWe went in underneath and tapped it, and we found that it had the pH of Drano.
p239
aVThe pH of 11, and yet it had chemosynthetic bacteria living in it
p240
aVand at this extreme environment.
p241
aVAnd the hydrothermal vents were in an acidic environment.
p242
aVAll the way at the other end, in an alkaline environment,
p243
aVat a pH of 11, life existed.
p244
aVSo life was much more creative than we had ever thought.
p245
aVAgain, discovered by accident. Just two years ago
p246
aVworking off Santorini, where people are sunning themselves on the beach,
p247
aVunbeknownst to them in the caldera nearby,
p248
aVwe found phenomenal hydrothermal vent systems
p249
aVand more life systems.
p250
aVThis was two miles from where people go to sunbathe,
p251
aVand they were oblivious to the existence of this system.
p252
aVAgain, you know, we stop at the water's edge.
p253
aa(lp254
VRecently, diving off \u2014 in the Gulf of Mexico, finding pools of water,
p255
aVthis time not upside down, right side up.
p256
aVBingo. You'd think you're in air, until a fish swims by.
p257
aVYou're looking at brine pools formed by salt diapirs.
p258
aVNear that was methane. I've never seen volcanoes of methane.
p259
aVInstead of belching out lava, they were belching out
p260
aVbig, big bubbles of methane. And they were creating these volcanoes,
p261
aVand there were flows, not of lava,
p262
aVbut of the mud coming out of the Earth but driven by \u2014
p263
aVI've never seen this before.
p264
aa(lp265
VMoving on, there's more than just natural history beneath the sea \u2014
p266
aVhuman history. Our discoveries of the Titanic.
p267
aVThe realization that the deep sea is the largest museum on Earth.
p268
aVIt contains more history than all of the museums on land combined.
p269
aVAnd yet we're only now penetrating it.
p270
aVFinding the state of preservation.
p271
aVWe found the Bismarck in 16,000 feet. We then found the Yorktown.
p272
aVPeople always ask, "Did you find the right ship?"
p273
aVIt said Yorktown on the stern.
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
VMore recently, finding ancient history.
p278
aVHow many ancient mariners have had a bad day? The number's a million.
p279
aVWe've been discovering these along ancient trade routes,
p280
aVwhere they're not supposed to be.
p281
aVThis shipwreck sank 100 years before the birth of Christ.
p282
aVThis one sank carrying a prefabricated, Home Depot Roman temple.
p283
aVAnd then here's one that sank at the time of Homer, at 750 B.C.
p284
aVMore recently, into the Black Sea, where we're exploring.
p285
aVBecause there's no oxygen there, it's the largest reservoir
p286
aVof hydrogen sulfide on Earth. Shipwrecks are perfectly preserved.
p287
aVAll their organics are perfectly preserved. We begin to excavate them.
p288
aVWe expect to start hauling out the bodies in perfect condition with their DNA.
p289
aVLook at the state of preservation \u2014
p290
aVstill the ad mark of a carpenter. Look at the state of those artifacts.
p291
aVYou still see the beeswax dripping. When they dropped, they sealed it.
p292
aVThis ship sank 1,500 years ago.
p293
aa(lp294
VFortunately, we've been able to convince Congress.
p295
aVWe begin to go on the Hill and lobby.
p296
aVAnd we stole recently a ship from the United States Navy.
p297
aVThe Okeanos Explorer on its mission.
p298
aVIts mission is as good as you could get.
p299
aVIts mission is to go where no one has gone before on planet Earth.
p300
aVAnd I was looking at it yesterday, it's up in Seattle. OK.
p301
aa(lp302
V(Applause)
p303
aa(lp304
VIt comes online this summer,
p305
aVand it begins its journey of exploration.
p306
aVBut we have no idea what we're going find when we go out there with our technology.
p307
aVBut certainly, it's going to be going to the unknown America.
p308
aVThis is that part of the United States that lies beneath the sea.
p309
aVWe own all of that blue and yet,
p310
aVlike I say, particularly the western territorial trust,
p311
aVwe don't have maps of them. We don't have maps of them.
p312
aVWe have maps of Venus, but not of the western territorial trust.
p313
aVThe way we're going to run this \u2014 we have no idea what we're going to discover.
p314
aVWe have no idea what we're going to discover.
p315
aVWe're going to discover an ancient shipwreck, a Phoenician off Brazil,
p316
aVor a new rock formation, a new life.
p317
aVSo, we're going to run it like an emergency hospital.
p318
aa(lp319
VWe're going to connect our command center,
p320
aVvia a high-bandwidth satellite link to a building we're building
p321
aVat the University of Rhode Island, called the Interspace Center.
p322
aVAnd within that, we're going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine,
p323
aVblue-gold team, switching them off and on, running 24 hours a day.
p324
aVA discovery is made, that discovery is instantly seen
p325
aVin the command center a second later.
p326
aVBut then it's connected through Internet too \u2014
p327
aVthe new Internet highway that makes Internet one
p328
aVlook like a dirt road on the information highway \u2014
p329
aVwith 10 gigabits of bandwidth.
p330
aVWe'll go into areas we have no knowledge of.
p331
aVIt's a big blank sheet on our planet. We'll map it within hours,
p332
aVhave the maps disseminated out to the major universities.
p333
aVIt turns out that 90 percent of all the oceanographic intellect
p334
aVin this country are at 12 universities. They're all on I-2.
p335
aVWe can then build a command center.
p336
aVThis is a remote center at the University of Washington.
p337
aVShe's talking to the pilot. She's 5,000 miles away, but she's assumed command.
p338
aa(lp339
VBut the beauty of this, too, is we can then disseminate it to children.
p340
aVWe can disseminate.
p341
aVThey can follow this expedition. I've started a program \u2014
p342
aVwhere are you Jim? Jim Young who helped me start a program
p343
aVcalled the Jason Project. More recently, we've started a program
p344
aVwith the Boys and Girls Clubs of America,
p345
aVso that we can use exploration,
p346
aVand the excitement of live exploration, to motivate them and excite them
p347
aVand then give them what they're already ready for.
p348
aVI would not let an adult drive my robot.
p349
aVYou don't have enough gaming experience.
p350
aVBut I will let a kid with no license take over control of my vehicle system.
p351
aa(lp352
V(Applause)
p353
aa(lp354
VBecause we want to create \u2014
p355
aVwe want to create the classroom of tomorrow.
p356
aVWe have stiff competition and we need to motivate and it's all being done.
p357
aVYou win or lose an engineer or a scientist by eighth grade.
p358
aVThe game is not over \u2014 it's over by the eighth grade, it's not beginning.
p359
aVWe need to be not only proud of our universities.
p360
aVWe need to be proud of our middle schools.
p361
aVAnd when we have the best middle schools in the world,
p362
aVwe'll have the best kids pumped out of that system, let me tell you.
p363
aVBecause this is what we want. This is what we want.
p364
aVThis is a young lady, not watching a football game,
p365
aVnot watching a basketball game.
p366
aVWatching exploration live from thousands of miles away,
p367
aVand it's just dawning on her what she's seeing.
p368
aVAnd when you get a jaw drop, you can inform.
p369
aVYou can put so much information into that mind, it's in full [receiving] mode.
p370
aa(lp371
V(Applause)
p372
aa(lp373
VThis, I hope, will be a future engineer
p374
aVor a future scientist in the battle for truth.
p375
aVAnd my final question, my final question \u2014
p376
aVwhy are we not looking at moving out onto the sea?
p377
aVWhy do we have programs to build habitation on Mars,
p378
aVand we have programs to look at colonizing the moon,
p379
aVbut we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet?
p380
aVAnd the technology is at hand.
p381
aa(lp382
VThank you very much.

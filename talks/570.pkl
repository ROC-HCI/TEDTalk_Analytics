VThis is called Hooked on a Feeling:
p5
aVThe Pursuit of Happiness and Human Design.
p6
aVI put up a somewhat dour Darwin,
p7
aVbut a very happy chimp up there.
p8
aVMy first point is that the pursuit of happiness is obligatory.
p9
aVMan wishes to be happy, only wishes to be happy,
p10
aVand cannot wish not to be so.
p11
aVWe are wired to pursue happiness,
p12
aVnot only to enjoy it, but to want more and more of it.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo given that that's true,
p15
aVhow good are we at increasing our happiness?
p16
aVWell, we certainly try.
p17
aVIf you look on the Amazon site, there are over 2,000 titles
p18
aVwith advice on the seven habits, the nine choices,
p19
aVthe 10 secrets,
p20
aVthe 14,000 thoughts that are supposed to bring happiness.
p21
aVNow another way we try to increase our happiness
p22
aVis we medicate ourselves.
p23
aVAnd so there's over 120 million prescriptions out there for antidepressants.
p24
aVProzac was really the first absolute blockbuster drug.
p25
aVIt was clean, efficient, there was no high,
p26
aVthere was really no danger, it had no street value.
p27
aVIn 1995,
p28
aVillegal drugs were a $400 billion business,
p29
aVrepresenting eight percent of world trade,
p30
aVroughly the same as gas and oil.
p31
aa(lp32
VThese routes to happiness haven't really increased happiness very much.
p33
aVOne problem that's happening now is,
p34
aValthough the rates of happiness
p35
aVare about as flat as the surface of the moon,
p36
aVdepression and anxiety are rising.
p37
aVSome people say this is because we have better diagnosis,
p38
aVand more people are being found out.
p39
aVIt isn't just that. We're seeing it all over the world.
p40
aVIn the United States right now
p41
aVthere are more suicides than homicides.
p42
aVThere is a rash of suicide in China.
p43
aVAnd the World Health Organization predicts
p44
aVby the year 2020
p45
aVthat depression will be
p46
aVthe second largest cause of disability.
p47
aa(lp48
VNow the good news here
p49
aVis that if you take surveys from around the world,
p50
aVwe see that about three quarters of people
p51
aVwill say they are at least pretty happy.
p52
aVBut this does not follow any of the usual trends.
p53
aVFor example, these two show great growth in income,
p54
aVabsolutely flat happiness curves.
p55
aa(lp56
VMy field, the field of psychology,
p57
aVhasn't done a whole lot
p58
aVto help us move forward in understanding human happiness.
p59
aVIn part, we have the legacy of Freud, who was a pessimist,
p60
aVwho said that pursuit of happiness is a doomed quest,
p61
aVis propelled by infantile aspects of the individual
p62
aVthat can never be met in reality.
p63
aVHe said, "One feels inclined to say
p64
aVthat the intention that man should be happy
p65
aVis not included in the plan of creation."
p66
aVSo the ultimate goal of psychoanalytic psychotherapy
p67
aVwas really what Freud called ordinary misery.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd Freud in part reflects
p72
aVthe anatomy of the human emotion system \u2014
p73
aVwhich is that we have both a positive and a negative system,
p74
aVand our negative system
p75
aVis extremely sensitive.
p76
aVSo for example, we're born loving the taste of something sweet
p77
aVand reacting aversively to the taste of something bitter.
p78
aVWe also find that people are more averse to losing
p79
aVthan they are happy to gain.
p80
aVThe formula for a happy marriage
p81
aVis five positive remarks, or interactions,
p82
aVfor every one negative.
p83
aVAnd that's how powerful the one negative is.
p84
aVEspecially expressions of contempt or disgust,
p85
aVwell you really need a lot of positives to upset that.
p86
aa(lp87
VI also put in here the stress response.
p88
aVWe're wired for dangers that are immediate,
p89
aVthat are physical, that are imminent,
p90
aVand so our body goes into an incredible reaction
p91
aVwhere endogenous opioids come in.
p92
aVWe have a system that is really ancient,
p93
aVand really there for physical danger.
p94
aVAnd so over time, this becomes a stress response,
p95
aVwhich has enormous effects on the body.
p96
aVCortisol floods the brain;
p97
aVit destroys hippocampal cells and memory,
p98
aVand can lead to all kinds of health problems.
p99
aa(lp100
VBut unfortunately, we need this system in part.
p101
aVIf we were only governed by pleasure
p102
aVwe would not survive.
p103
aVWe really have two command posts.
p104
aVEmotions are short-lived intense responses
p105
aVto challenge and to opportunity.
p106
aVAnd each one of them allows us to click into alternate selves
p107
aVthat tune in, turn on, drop out
p108
aVthoughts, perceptions, feelings and memories.
p109
aVWe tend to think of emotions as just feelings.
p110
aVBut in fact, emotions are an all-systems alert
p111
aVthat change what we remember,
p112
aVwhat kind of decisions we make,
p113
aVand how we perceive things.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo let me go forward to the new science of happiness.
p116
aVWe've come away from the Freudian gloom,
p117
aVand people are now actively studying this.
p118
aVAnd one of the key points in the science of happiness
p119
aVis that happiness and unhappiness
p120
aVare not endpoints of a single continuum.
p121
aVThe Freudian model is really one continuum
p122
aVthat, as you get less miserable,
p123
aVyou get happier.
p124
aVAnd that isn't true \u2014 when you get less miserable,
p125
aVyou get less miserable.
p126
aVAnd that happiness is a whole other end of the equation.
p127
aVAnd it's been missing. It's been missing from psychotherapy.
p128
aVSo when people's symptoms go away, they tend to recur,
p129
aVbecause there isn't a sense of the other half \u2014
p130
aVof what pleasure, happiness, compassion, gratitude,
p131
aVwhat are the positive emotions.
p132
aVAnd of course we know this intuitively,
p133
aVthat happiness is not just the absence of misery.
p134
aVBut somehow it was not put forward until very recently,
p135
aVseeing these as two parallel systems.
p136
aVSo that the body can both look for opportunity
p137
aVand also protect itself from danger, at the same time.
p138
aVAnd they're sort of two reciprocal
p139
aVand dynamically interacting systems.
p140
aa(lp141
VPeople have also wanted to deconstruct.
p142
aVWe use this word "happy,"
p143
aVand it's this very large umbrella of a term.
p144
aVAnd then three emotions for which there are no English words:
p145
aVfiero, which is the pride in accomplishment of a challenge;
p146
aVschadenfreude, which is happiness in another's misfortune,
p147
aVa malicious pleasure;
p148
aVand naches, which is a pride and joy in one's children.
p149
aVAbsent from this list, and absent from any discussions of happiness,
p150
aVare happiness in another's happiness.
p151
aVWe don't seem to have a word for that.
p152
aVWe are very sensitive to the negative,
p153
aVbut it is in part offset by the fact
p154
aVthat we have a positivity.
p155
aa(lp156
VWe're also born pleasure-seekers.
p157
aVBabies love the taste of sweet
p158
aVand hate the taste of bitter.
p159
aVThey love to touch smooth surfaces rather than rough ones.
p160
aVThey like to look at beautiful faces
p161
aVrather than plain faces.
p162
aVThey like to listen to consonant melodies
p163
aVinstead of dissonant melodies.
p164
aVBabies really are born
p165
aVwith a lot of innate pleasures.
p166
aVThere was once a statement made by a psychologist
p167
aVthat said that 80 percent of the pursuit of happiness
p168
aVis really just about the genes,
p169
aVand it's as difficult to become happier as it is to become taller.
p170
aVThat's nonsense.
p171
aVThere is a decent contribution to happiness from the genes \u2014
p172
aVabout 50 percent \u2014
p173
aVbut there is still that 50 percent that is unaccounted for.
p174
aa(lp175
VLet's just go into the brain for a moment,
p176
aVand see where does happiness
p177
aVarise from in evolution.
p178
aVWe have basically at least two systems here,
p179
aVand they both are very ancient.
p180
aVOne is the reward system,
p181
aVand that's fed by the chemical dopamine.
p182
aVAnd it starts in the ventral tegmental area.
p183
aVIt goes to the nucleus accumbens,
p184
aVall the way up to the prefrontal cortex, orbital frontal cortex,
p185
aVwhere decisions are made, high level.
p186
aVThis was originally seen as a system
p187
aVthat was the pleasure system of the brain.
p188
aVIn the 1950s,
p189
aVOlds and Milner put electrodes into the brain of a rat.
p190
aVAnd the rat would just keep pressing that bar
p191
aVthousands and thousands and thousands of times.
p192
aVIt wouldn't eat. It wouldn't sleep. It wouldn't have sex.
p193
aVIt wouldn't do anything but press this bar.
p194
aVSo they assumed
p195
aVthis must be, you know, the brain's orgasmatron.
p196
aa(lp197
VIt turned out that it wasn't,
p198
aVthat it really is a system of motivation,
p199
aVa system of wanting.
p200
aVIt gives objects what's called incentive salience.
p201
aVIt makes something look so attractive
p202
aVthat you just have to go after it.
p203
aVThat's something different
p204
aVfrom the system that is the pleasure system,
p205
aVwhich simply says, "I like this."
p206
aVThe pleasure system, as you see,
p207
aVwhich is the internal opiates, there is a hormone oxytocin,
p208
aVis widely spread throughout the brain.
p209
aVDopamine system, the wanting system,
p210
aVis much more centralized.
p211
aa(lp212
VThe other thing about positive emotions is that they have a universal signal.
p213
aVAnd we see here the smile.
p214
aVAnd the universal signal is not just raising the corner of the lips
p215
aVto the zygomatic major.
p216
aVIt's also crinkling the outer corner of the eye,
p217
aVthe orbicularis oculi.
p218
aVSo you see, even 10-month-old babies, when they see their mother,
p219
aVwill show this particular kind of smile.
p220
aVExtroverts use it more than introverts.
p221
aVPeople who are relieved of depression
p222
aVshow it more after than before.
p223
aVSo if you want to unmask a true look of happiness,
p224
aVyou will look for this expression.
p225
aa(lp226
VOur pleasures are really ancient.
p227
aVAnd we learn, of course, many, many pleasures,
p228
aVbut many of them are base. And one of them, of course, is biophilia \u2014
p229
aVthat we have a response to the natural world
p230
aVthat's very profound.
p231
aVVery interesting studies
p232
aVdone on people recovering from surgery,
p233
aVwho found that people who faced a brick wall
p234
aVversus people who looked out on trees and nature,
p235
aVthe people who looked out on the brick wall
p236
aVwere in the hospital longer, needed more medication,
p237
aVand had more medical complications.
p238
aVThere is something very restorative about nature,
p239
aVand it's part of how we are tuned.
p240
aa(lp241
VHumans, particularly so, we're very imitative creatures.
p242
aVAnd we imitate from almost the second we are born.
p243
aVHere is a three-week-old baby.
p244
aVAnd if you stick your tongue out at this baby,
p245
aVthe baby will do the same.
p246
aVWe are social beings from the beginning.
p247
aVAnd even studies of cooperation
p248
aVshow that cooperation between individuals
p249
aVlights up reward centers of the brain.
p250
aVOne problem that psychology has had
p251
aVis instead of looking at this intersubjectivity \u2014
p252
aVor the importance of the social brain
p253
aVto humans who come into the world helpless
p254
aVand need each other tremendously \u2014
p255
aVis that they focus instead on the self
p256
aVand self-esteem, and not self-other.
p257
aVIt's sort of "me," not "we."
p258
aVAnd I think this has been a really tremendous problem
p259
aVthat goes against our biology and nature,
p260
aVand hasn't made us any happier at all.
p261
aa(lp262
VBecause when you think about it, people are happiest when in flow,
p263
aVwhen they're absorbed in something out in the world,
p264
aVwhen they're with other people, when they're active,
p265
aVengaged in sports, focusing on a loved one,
p266
aVlearning, having sex, whatever.
p267
aVThey're not sitting in front of the mirror
p268
aVtrying to figure themselves out,
p269
aVor thinking about themselves.
p270
aVThese are not the periods when you feel happiest.
p271
aVThe other thing is, that a piece of evidence is,
p272
aVis if you look at computerized text analysis
p273
aVof people who commit suicide,
p274
aVwhat you find there, and it's quite interesting,
p275
aVis use of the first person singular \u2014
p276
aV"I," "me," "my,"
p277
aVnot "we" and "us" \u2014
p278
aVand the letters are less hopeless
p279
aVthan they are really alone.
p280
aVAnd being alone is very unnatural to the human.
p281
aVThere is a profound need to belong.
p282
aa(lp283
VBut there are ways in which our evolutionary history can really trip us up.
p284
aVBecause, for example, the genes don't care whether we're happy,
p285
aVthey care that we replicate,
p286
aVthat we pass our genes on.
p287
aVSo for example we have three systems
p288
aVthat underlie reproduction, because it's so important.
p289
aVThere's lust, which is just wanting to have sex.
p290
aVAnd that's really mediated by the sex hormones.
p291
aVRomantic attraction,
p292
aVthat gets into the desire system.
p293
aVAnd that's dopamine-fed. And that's, "I must have this one person."
p294
aVThere's attachment, which is oxytocin,
p295
aVand the opiates, which says, "This is a long-term bond."
p296
aVSee the problem is that, as humans, these three can separate.
p297
aVSo a person can be in a long term attachment,
p298
aVbecome romantically infatuated with someone else,
p299
aVand want to have sex with a third person.
p300
aa(lp301
VThe other way in which our genes can sometimes lead us astray
p302
aVis in social status.
p303
aVWe are very acutely aware of our social status
p304
aVand always seek to further and increase it.
p305
aVNow in the animal world, there is only one way to increase status,
p306
aVand that's dominance.
p307
aVI seize command by physical prowess,
p308
aVand I keep it by beating my chest,
p309
aVand you make submissive gestures.
p310
aVNow, the human has a whole other way to rise to the top,
p311
aVand that is a prestige route,
p312
aVwhich is freely conferred.
p313
aVSomeone has expertise and knowledge, and knows how to do things,
p314
aVand we give that person status.
p315
aVAnd that's clearly the way for us to create many more niches of status
p316
aVso that people don't have to be lower on the status hierarchy
p317
aVas they are in the animal world.
p318
aa(lp319
VThe data isn't terribly supportive of money buying happiness.
p320
aVBut it's not irrelevant.
p321
aVSo if you look at questions like this, life satisfaction,
p322
aVyou see life satisfaction going up with each rung of income.
p323
aVYou see mental distress going up with lower income.
p324
aVSo clearly there is some effect.
p325
aVBut the effect is relatively small.
p326
aVAnd one of the problems with money is materialism.
p327
aVWhat happens when people pursue money too avidly,
p328
aVis they forget about the real basic pleasures of life.
p329
aVSo we have here, this couple.
p330
aV"Do you think the less-fortunate are having better sex?"
p331
aVAnd then this kid over here is saying, "Leave me alone with my toys."
p332
aVSo one of the things is that it really takes over.
p333
aVThat whole dopamine-wanting system
p334
aVtakes over and derails from any of the pleasure system.
p335
aa(lp336
VMaslow had this idea back in the 1950s
p337
aVthat as people rise above their biological needs,
p338
aVas the world becomes safer
p339
aVand we don't have to worry about basic needs being met \u2014
p340
aVour biological system, whatever motivates us, is being satisfied \u2014
p341
aVwe can rise above them, to think beyond ourselves
p342
aVtoward self-actualization or transcendence,
p343
aVand rise above the materialist.
p344
aa(lp345
VSo to just quickly conclude with some brief data
p346
aVthat suggests this might be so.
p347
aVOne is people who underwent what is called a quantum change:
p348
aVthey felt their life and their whole values had changed.
p349
aVAnd sure enough, if you look at the kinds of values that come in,
p350
aVyou see wealth, adventure, achievement, pleasure, fun, be respected,
p351
aVbefore the change,
p352
aVand much more post-materialist values after.
p353
aVWomen had a whole different set of value shifts.
p354
aVBut very similarly, the only one that survived there was happiness.
p355
aVThey went from attractiveness and happiness and wealth and self-control
p356
aVto generosity and forgiveness.
p357
aa(lp358
VI end with a few quotes.
p359
aV"There is only one question:
p360
aVHow to love this world?"
p361
aVAnd Rilke, "If your daily life seems poor,
p362
aVdo not blame it; blame yourself.
p363
aVTell yourself that you are not poet enough
p364
aVto call forth its riches."
p365
aV"First, say to yourself what you would be.
p366
aVThen do what you have to do."
p367
aa(lp368
VThank you.
p369
aV(Applause)

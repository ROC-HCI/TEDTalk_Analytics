VSo this is a picture of my dad and me, at the beach in Far Rockaway,
p5
aVor actually Rockaway Park.
p6
aVI'm the one with the blond hair.
p7
aVMy dad's the guy with the cigarette.
p8
aVIt was the 60's.
p9
aVA lot of people smoked back then.
p10
aVIn the summer of 2009, my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer.
p11
aVCancer is one of those things that actually touches everybody.
p12
aVIf you're a man in the US,
p13
aVyou've got about a one in two chance
p14
aVof being diagnosed with cancer during your lifetime.
p15
aVIf you're a woman, you've got about a one in three chance
p16
aVof being diagnosed with cancer.
p17
aVEverybody knows somebody who's been diagnosed with cancer.
p18
aa(lp19
VNow, my dad's doing better today,
p20
aVand part of the reason for that is that he was able to participate in the trial
p21
aVof an experimental new drug that happened to be specially formulated
p22
aVand very good for his particular kind of cancer.
p23
aVThere are over 200 kinds of cancer.
p24
aVAnd what I want to talk about today
p25
aVis how we can help more people like my dad,
p26
aVbecause we have to change the way we think about raising money
p27
aVto fund cancer research.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo a while after my dad was diagnosed,
p30
aVI was having coffee with my friend Andrew Lo.
p31
aVHe's the head of the Laboratory for Financial Engineering at MIT,
p32
aVwhere I also have a position,
p33
aVand we were talking about cancer.
p34
aVAnd Andrew had been doing his own bits of research,
p35
aVand one of the things that he had been told
p36
aVand that he'd learned from studying the literature
p37
aVwas that there's actually a big bottleneck.
p38
aVIt's very difficult to develop new drugs,
p39
aVand the reason it's difficult to develop new drugs
p40
aVis because in the early stages of drug development,
p41
aVthe drugs are very risky, and they're very expensive.
p42
aVSo Andrew asked me if I'd want to maybe work with him a bit,
p43
aVwork on some of the math and the analytics
p44
aVand see if we could figure out something we could do.
p45
aa(lp46
VNow I'm not a scientist.
p47
aVYou know, I don't know how to build a drug.
p48
aVAnd none of my coauthors, Andrew Lo or Jose-Maria Fernandez or David Fagnan \u2014
p49
aVnone of those guys are scientists either.
p50
aVWe don't know the first thing about how to make a cancer drug.
p51
aVBut we know a little bit about risk mitigation
p52
aVand a little bit about financial engineering,
p53
aVand so we started thinking, what could we do?
p54
aVI'm going to tell you about some work
p55
aVwe've been doing over the last couple years
p56
aVthat we think could fundamentally change the way
p57
aVresearch for cancer and lots of other things gets done.
p58
aVWe want to let the research drive the funding,
p59
aVnot the other way around.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo in order to get started,
p62
aVlet me tell you how you get a drug financed.
p63
aVImagine that you're in your lab \u2014 you're a scientist, you're not like me \u2014
p64
aVand you've developed a new compound
p65
aVthat you think might be therapeutic for somebody with cancer.
p66
aVWell, what you do is, you test in animals, you test in test tubes,
p67
aVbut there's this notion of going from the bench to the bedside,
p68
aVand in order to get from the bench, the lab, to the bedside, to the patients,
p69
aVyou've got to get the drug tested.
p70
aVAnd the way the drug gets tested
p71
aVis through a series of, basically, experiments,
p72
aVthrough these large, they're called trials,
p73
aVthat they do to determine whether the drug is safe
p74
aVand whether it works and all these things.
p75
aVSo the FDA has a very specific protocol.
p76
aVIn the first phase of this testing,
p77
aVwhich is called testing for toxicity, it's called Phase I.
p78
aVIn the first phase, you give the drug to healthy people
p79
aVand you see if it actually makes them sick.
p80
aVIn other words, are the side effects just so severe
p81
aVthat no matter how much good it does,
p82
aVit's not going to be worth it?
p83
aVDoes it cause heart attacks, kill people, liver failure?
p84
aVAnd it turns out, that's a pretty high hurdle.
p85
aVAbout a third of all drugs drop out at that point.
p86
aVIn the next phase, you test to see if the drug's effective,
p87
aVand you give it to people with cancer
p88
aVand you see if it makes them better.
p89
aVAnd that's also a higher hurdle. People drop out.
p90
aVAnd in the third phase, you test it on a very large sample,
p91
aVand you're trying to determine what the right dose is,
p92
aVis it better than what's available today? If not, then why build it?
p93
aVWhen you're done with all that,
p94
aVwhat you have is a very small percentage of drugs
p95
aVthat start the process actually come out the other side.
p96
aVSo those blue bottles \u2014 those blue bottles save lives,
p97
aVand they're also worth billions, sometimes billions a year.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo now here's a question:
p100
aVif I were to ask you, for example,
p101
aVto make a one-time investment of, say, 200 million dollars
p102
aVto buy one of those bottles,
p103
aVso 200 million dollars up front, one time, to buy one of those bottles,
p104
aVI won't tell you which one it is,
p105
aVand in 10 years, I'll tell you whether you have one of the blue ones.
p106
aVDoes that sound like a good deal for anybody?
p107
aVNo. No, right?
p108
aVAnd of course, it's a very, very risky trial position,
p109
aVand that's why it's very hard to get funding,
p110
aVbut to a first approximation, that's actually the proposal.
p111
aVYou have to fund these things from the early stages on.
p112
aVIt takes a long time.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo Andrew said to me, he said,
p115
aV"What if we stop thinking about these as drugs?
p116
aVWhat if we start thinking about them as financial assets?"
p117
aVThey've got really weird payoff structures and all that,
p118
aVbut let's throw everything we know about financial engineering at them.
p119
aVLet's see if we can use all the tricks of the trade
p120
aVto figure out how to make these drugs work as financial assets.
p121
aa(lp122
VLet's create a giant fund.
p123
aVIn finance, we know what to do with assets that are risky.
p124
aVYou put them in a portfolio and you try to smooth out the returns.
p125
aVSo we did some math, and it turned out you could make this work,
p126
aVbut in order to make it work, you need about 80 to 150 drugs.
p127
aa(lp128
VNow the good news is, there's plenty of drugs
p129
aVthat are waiting to be tested.
p130
aVWe've been told that there's a backlog of about 20 years of drugs
p131
aVthat are waiting to be tested but can't be funded.
p132
aVIn fact, that early stage of the funding process,
p133
aVthat Phase I and preclinical stuff,
p134
aVthat's actually, in the industry, called the Valley of Death
p135
aVbecause it's where drugs go to die.
p136
aVIt's very hard to for them to get through there,
p137
aVand of course, if you can't get through there,
p138
aVyou can't get to the later stages.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo we did this math, and we figured out, OK,
p141
aVwell, you need about 80 to, say, 150, or something like that, drugs.
p142
aVAnd then we did a little more math, and we said, OK,
p143
aVwell, that's a fund of about three to 15 billion dollars.
p144
aVSo we kind of created a new problem by solving the old one.
p145
aVWe got rid of the risk, but now we need a lot of capital,
p146
aVand you can only get that kind of capital in the capital markets.
p147
aVVenture capitalists and philanthropies don't have it.
p148
aVBut we have to figure out how to get people in the capital markets,
p149
aVwho traditionally don't invest in this, to want to invest in this stuff.
p150
aVSo again, financial engineering was helpful here.
p151
aVImagine the megafund starts empty,
p152
aVand what it does is it issues some debt and some equity,
p153
aVand that generates cash flow.
p154
aVThat cash flow is used, then, to buy that big portfolio of drugs that you need,
p155
aVand those drugs start working their way through that approval process,
p156
aVand each time they go through a phase of approval,
p157
aVthey gain value.
p158
aVMost of them don't make it, but a few of them do,
p159
aVand with the ones that gain value, you can sell some,
p160
aVand when you sell them,
p161
aVyou have money to pay the interest on those bonds,
p162
aVbut also to fund the next round of trials.
p163
aVIt's almost self-funding.
p164
aVYou do that for the course of the transaction,
p165
aVand when you're done, you liquidate the portfolio,
p166
aVpay back the bonds, and you can give the equity holders a nice return.
p167
aa(lp168
VThat was the theory, and we talked about it,
p169
aVwe did a bunch of experiments,
p170
aVand then we said, let's really try to test it.
p171
aVWe spent the next two years doing research.
p172
aVWe talked to hundreds of experts in drug financing and venture capital.
p173
aVWe talked to people who have developed drugs.
p174
aVWe talked to pharmaceutical companies.
p175
aVWe actually looked at the data for drugs,
p176
aVover 2,000 drugs that had been approved or denied or withdrawn,
p177
aVand we also ran millions of simulations.
p178
aVAnd all that actually took a lot of time.
p179
aVBut when we were done, we found something that was sort of surprising.
p180
aVIt was feasible to structure that fund
p181
aVsuch that when you were done structuring it,
p182
aVyou could actually produce low-risk bonds that would be attractive to bond holders,
p183
aVthat would give you yields of about five to eight percent,
p184
aVand you could produce equity
p185
aVthat would give equity holders about a 12 percent return.
p186
aVNow those returns aren't going to be attractive to a venture capitalist.
p187
aVThey want to make those big bets
p188
aVand get those billion dollar payoffs.
p189
aVBut it turns out there are lots of other folks that would be interested.
p190
aVThat's right in the investment sweet spot of pension funds and 401(k) plans
p191
aVand all this other stuff.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo we published some articles in the academic press,
p194
aVin medical journals, in finance journals.
p195
aVBut it wasn't until we actually got the popular press interested in this
p196
aVthat we began to get some traction.
p197
aa(lp198
VWe wanted to do more than just make people aware of it.
p199
aVWe wanted people to get involved.
p200
aVSo we took all of our computer code and made that available online
p201
aVunder an open-source license to anybody that wanted it.
p202
aVAnd you guys can download it today
p203
aVif you want to run your own experiments to see if this would work.
p204
aVAnd that was really effective,
p205
aVbecause people that didn't believe our assumptions
p206
aVcould try their own and see how it would work.
p207
aa(lp208
VNow there's an obvious problem, which is,
p209
aVis there enough money in the world to fund this?
p210
aVI've told you there's enough drugs, but is there enough money?
p211
aVThere's 100 trillion dollars of capital
p212
aVcurrently invested in fixed-income securities.
p213
aVThat's a hundred thousand billion.
p214
aVThere's plenty of money.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Laughter)
p217
aa(lp218
VBut we realized it's more than just money that's required.
p219
aVWe had to get people motivated, involved,
p220
aVand get them to understand this.
p221
aVAnd we started thinking about all the different things that could go wrong.
p222
aVWhat are all the challenges that might get in the way?
p223
aVAnd we had a long list.
p224
aVWe assigned a bunch of people, including ourselves,
p225
aVdifferent pieces of this problem.
p226
aVAnd we said, could you start a work stream on credit risk?
p227
aVCould you start a work stream on the regulatory aspects?
p228
aVCould you start a work stream on how you would manage so many projects?
p229
aVAnd we had all these experts get together and do these different work streams,
p230
aVand then we held a conference.
p231
aVThe conference was held over this past summer.
p232
aVIt was an invitation-only conference.
p233
aVIt was sponsored by the American Cancer Society
p234
aVand done in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute.
p235
aVWe had experts from every field we thought would be important,
p236
aVincluding the government, and people that run research centers,
p237
aVand for two days they heard the reports
p238
aVfrom those five work streams, and talked about it.
p239
aVIt was the first time the people who could make this happen
p240
aVsat across the table from each other and had these conversations.
p241
aa(lp242
VNow these conferences, it's typical to have a dinner,
p243
aVand at that dinner, you get to know each other,
p244
aVsort of like what we're doing here.
p245
aVI happened to look out the window,
p246
aVand hand on my heart,
p247
aVon the night of this conference \u2014 it was the summertime \u2014
p248
aVand that's what I saw, a double rainbow.
p249
aVSo I'd like to think it was a good sign.
p250
aa(lp251
VSince the conference, we've got people working between Paris and San Francisco,
p252
aVlots of different folks working on this
p253
aVto try to see if we can really make it happen.
p254
aVWe're not looking to start a fund, but we want somebody else to do this.
p255
aVBecause, again, I'm not a scientist.
p256
aVI can't build a drug.
p257
aVI'm never going to have enough money to fund even one of those trials.
p258
aVBut all of us together, with our 401(k)s,
p259
aVwith our 529 plans, with our pension plans,
p260
aVall of us together can actually fund hundreds of trials
p261
aVand get paid well for doing it
p262
aVand save millions of lives like my dad.
p263
aa(lp264
VThank you.

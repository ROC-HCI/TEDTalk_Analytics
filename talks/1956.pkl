VGood morning.
p5
aVWhen I was a little boy,
p6
aVI had an experience that changed my life,
p7
aVand is in fact why I'm here today.
p8
aVThat one moment
p9
aVprofoundly affected how I think about
p10
aVart, design and engineering.
p11
aa(lp12
VAs background, I was fortunate enough to grow up
p13
aVin a family of loving and talented artists
p14
aVin one of the world's great cities.
p15
aVMy dad, John Ferren, who died when I was 15,
p16
aVwas an artist by both passion and profession,
p17
aVas is my mom, Rae.
p18
aVHe was one of the New York School
p19
aVabstract expressionists who,
p20
aVtogether with his contemporaries,
p21
aVinvented American modern art,
p22
aVand contributed to moving the American zeitgeist
p23
aVtowards modernism in the 20th century.
p24
aVIsn't it remarkable that, after thousands of years
p25
aVof people doing mostly representational art,
p26
aVthat modern art, comparatively speaking,
p27
aVis about 15 minutes old,
p28
aVyet now pervasive.
p29
aVAs with many other important innovations,
p30
aVthose radical ideas required no new technology,
p31
aVjust fresh thinking and a willingness to experiment,
p32
aVplus resiliency in the face of near-universal criticism
p33
aVand rejection.
p34
aVIn our home, art was everywhere.
p35
aVIt was like oxygen,
p36
aVaround us and necessary for life.
p37
aVAs I watched him paint,
p38
aVDad taught me that art
p39
aVwas not about being decorative,
p40
aVbut was a different way of communicating ideas,
p41
aVand in fact one that could bridge the worlds
p42
aVof knowledge and insight.
p43
aa(lp44
VGiven this rich artistic environment,
p45
aVyou'd assume that I would have been compelled
p46
aVto go into the family business,
p47
aVbut no.
p48
aVI followed the path of most kids
p49
aVwho are genetically programmed
p50
aVto make their parents crazy.
p51
aVI had no interest in becoming an artist,
p52
aVcertainly not a painter.
p53
aVWhat I did love was electronics and machines \u2014
p54
aVtaking them apart, building new ones,
p55
aVand making them work.
p56
aVFortunately, my family also had engineers in it,
p57
aVand with my parents,
p58
aVthese were my first role models.
p59
aVWhat they all had in common
p60
aVwas they worked very, very hard.
p61
aVMy grandpa owned and operated a sheet metal
p62
aVkitchen cabinet factory in Brooklyn.
p63
aVOn weekends, we would go together to Cortlandt Street,
p64
aVwhich was New York City's radio row.
p65
aVThere we would explore massive piles
p66
aVof surplus electronics,
p67
aVand for a few bucks bring home treasures
p68
aVlike Norden bombsights
p69
aVand parts from the first IBM tube-based computers.
p70
aVI found these objects both useful and fascinating.
p71
aVI learned about engineering and how things worked,
p72
aVnot at school
p73
aVbut by taking apart and studying
p74
aVthese fabulously complex devices.
p75
aVI did this for hours every day,
p76
aVapparently avoiding electrocution.
p77
aVLife was good.
p78
aa(lp79
VHowever, every summer, sadly,
p80
aVthe machines got left behind
p81
aVwhile my parents and I traveled overseas
p82
aVto experience history, art and design.
p83
aVWe visited the great museums and historic buildings
p84
aVof both Europe and the Middle East,
p85
aVbut to encourage my growing interest
p86
aVin science and technology,
p87
aVthey would simply drop me off in places
p88
aVlike the London Science Museum,
p89
aVwhere I would wander endlessly for hours by myself
p90
aVstudying the history of science and technology.
p91
aa(lp92
VThen, when I was about nine years old,
p93
aVwe went to Rome.
p94
aVOn one particularly hot summer day,
p95
aVwe visited a drum-shaped building that from the outside
p96
aVwas not particularly interesting.
p97
aVMy dad said it was called the Pantheon,
p98
aVa temple for all of the gods.
p99
aVIt didn't look all that special from the outside,
p100
aVas I said, but when we walked inside,
p101
aVI was immediately struck by three things:
p102
aVFirst of all, it was pleasantly cool
p103
aVdespite the oppressive heat outside.
p104
aVIt was very dark, the only source of light
p105
aVbeing an big open hole in the roof.
p106
aVDad explained that this wasn't a big open hole,
p107
aVbut it was called the oculus,
p108
aVan eye to the heavens.
p109
aVAnd there was something about this place,
p110
aVI didn't know why, that just felt special.
p111
aVAs we walked to the center of the room,
p112
aVI looked up at the heavens through the oculus.
p113
aVThis was the first church that I'd been to
p114
aVthat provided an unrestricted view
p115
aVbetween God and man.
p116
aVBut I wondered, what about when it rained?
p117
aVDad may have called this an oculus,
p118
aVbut it was, in fact, a big hole in the roof.
p119
aVI looked down and saw floor drains
p120
aVhad been cut into the stone floor.
p121
aVAs I became more accustomed to the dark,
p122
aVI was able to make out details of the floor
p123
aVand the surrounding walls.
p124
aVNo big deal here, just the same statuary stuff
p125
aVthat we'd seen all over Rome.
p126
aVIn fact, it looked like the Appian Way
p127
aVmarble salesman showed up
p128
aVwith his sample book, showed it to Hadrian,
p129
aVand Hadrian said, "We'll take all of it."
p130
aV(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
VBut the ceiling was amazing.
p133
aVIt looked like a Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome.
p134
aVI'd seen these before,
p135
aVand Bucky was friends with my dad.
p136
aVIt was modern, high-tech, impressive,
p137
aVa huge 142-foot clear span
p138
aVwhich, not coincidentally, was exactly its height.
p139
aVI loved this place.
p140
aVIt was really beautiful and unlike anything I'd ever seen before,
p141
aVso I asked my dad, "When was this built?"
p142
aVHe said, "About 2,000 years ago."
p143
aVAnd I said, "No, I mean, the roof."
p144
aVYou see, I assumed that this was a modern roof
p145
aVthat had been put on because the original
p146
aVwas destroyed in some long-past war.
p147
aVHe said, "It's the original roof."
p148
aa(lp149
VThat moment changed my life,
p150
aVand I can remember it as if it were yesterday.
p151
aVFor the first time, I realized people were smart
p152
aV2,000 years ago. (Laughter)
p153
aVThis had never crossed my mind.
p154
aVI mean, to me, the pyramids at Giza,
p155
aVwe visited those the year before,
p156
aVand sure they're impressive, nice enough design,
p157
aVbut look, give me an unlimited budget,
p158
aV20,000 to 40,000 laborers, and about 10 to 20 years
p159
aVto cut and drag stone blocks  across the countryside,
p160
aVand I'll build you pyramids too.
p161
aVBut no amount of brute force
p162
aVgets you the dome of the Pantheon,
p163
aVnot 2,000 years ago, nor today.
p164
aVAnd incidentally, it is still the largest
p165
aVunreinforced concrete dome that's ever been built.
p166
aVTo build the Pantheon took some miracles.
p167
aVBy miracles, I mean things that are
p168
aVtechnically barely possible,
p169
aVvery high-risk, and might not be
p170
aVactually accomplishable at this moment in time,
p171
aVcertainly not by you.
p172
aa(lp173
VFor example, here are some of the Pantheon's miracles.
p174
aVTo make it even structurally possible,
p175
aVthey had to invent super-strong concrete,
p176
aVand to control weight,
p177
aVvaried the density of the aggregate
p178
aVas they worked their way up the dome.
p179
aVFor strength and lightness, the dome structure
p180
aVused five rings of coffers,
p181
aVeach of diminishing size,
p182
aVwhich imparts a dramatic forced perspective
p183
aVto the design.
p184
aVIt was wonderfully cool inside
p185
aVbecause of its huge thermal mass,
p186
aVnatural convection of air rising up
p187
aVthrough the oculus,
p188
aVand a Venturi effect when wind blows across
p189
aVthe top of the building.
p190
aVI discovered for the first time that light itself
p191
aVhas substance.
p192
aVThe shaft of light beaming through the oculus
p193
aVwas both beautiful and palpable,
p194
aVand I realized for the first time
p195
aVthat light could be designed.
p196
aVFurther, that of all of the forms of design,
p197
aVvisual design,
p198
aVthey were all kind of irrelevant without it,
p199
aVbecause without light, you can't see any of them.
p200
aVI also realized that I wasn't the first person
p201
aVto think that this place was really special.
p202
aVIt survived gravity, barbarians, looters, developers
p203
aVand the ravages of time to become
p204
aVwhat I believe is the longest
p205
aVcontinuously occupied building in history.
p206
aa(lp207
VLargely because of that visit,
p208
aVI came to understand that,
p209
aVcontrary to what I was being told in school,
p210
aVthe worlds of art and design
p211
aVwere not, in fact, incompatible
p212
aVwith science and engineering.
p213
aVI realized, when combined,
p214
aVyou could create things that were amazing
p215
aVthat couldn't be done in either domain alone.
p216
aVBut in school, with few exceptions,
p217
aVthey were treated as separate worlds,
p218
aVand they still are.
p219
aVMy teachers told me that I had to get serious
p220
aVand focus on one or the other.
p221
aVHowever, urging me to specialize
p222
aVonly caused me to really  appreciate those polymaths
p223
aVlike Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci,
p224
aVBenjamin Franklin,
p225
aVpeople who did exactly the opposite.
p226
aVAnd this led me to embrace
p227
aVand want to be in both worlds.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo then how do these projects of unprecedented creative vision and technical complexity
p230
aVlike the Pantheon actually happen?
p231
aVSomeone themselves, perhaps Hadrian,
p232
aVneeded a brilliant creative vision.
p233
aVThey also needed the storytelling and leadership skills
p234
aVnecessary to fund and execute it,
p235
aVand a mastery of science and technology
p236
aVwith the ability and knowhow
p237
aVto push existing innovations even farther.
p238
aVIt is my belief that to create these rare game changers
p239
aVrequires you to pull off at least five miracles.
p240
aVThe problem is, no matter how talented,
p241
aVrich or smart you are,
p242
aVyou only get one to one and a half miracles.
p243
aVThat's it. That's the quota.
p244
aVThen you run out of time, money, enthusiasm,
p245
aVwhatever.
p246
aVRemember, most people can't even imagine
p247
aVone of these technical miracles,
p248
aVand you need at least five to make a Pantheon.
p249
aVIn my experience, these rare visionaries
p250
aVwho can think across the worlds of art,
p251
aVdesign and engineering
p252
aVhave the ability to notice
p253
aVwhen others have provided enough of the miracles
p254
aVto bring the goal within reach.
p255
aVDriven by the clarity of their vision,
p256
aVthey summon the courage and determination
p257
aVto deliver the remaining miracles
p258
aVand they often take what other people think to be
p259
aVinsurmountable obstacles
p260
aVand turn them into features.
p261
aVTake the oculus of the Pantheon.
p262
aVBy insisting that it be in the design,
p263
aVit meant you couldn't use much of the structural technology
p264
aVthat had been developed for Roman arches.
p265
aVHowever, by instead embracing it
p266
aVand rethinking weight and stress distribution,
p267
aVthey came up with a design that only works
p268
aVif there's a big hole in the roof.
p269
aVThat done, you now get the aesthetic
p270
aVand design benefits of light, cooling
p271
aVand that critical direct connection with the heavens.
p272
aVNot bad.
p273
aVThese people not only believed
p274
aVthat the impossible can be done,
p275
aVbut that it must be done.
p276
aa(lp277
VEnough ancient history.
p278
aVWhat are some recent examples of innovations
p279
aVthat combine creative design
p280
aVand technological advances in a way so profound
p281
aVthat they will be remembered
p282
aVa thousand years from now?
p283
aVWell, putting a man on the moon was a good one,
p284
aVand returning him safely to Earth wasn't bad either.
p285
aVTalk about one giant leap:
p286
aVIt's hard to imagine a more profound moment
p287
aVin human history
p288
aVthan when we first left our world
p289
aVto set foot on another.
p290
aa(lp291
VSo what came after the moon?
p292
aVOne is tempted to say that today's pantheon
p293
aVis the Internet,
p294
aVbut I actually think that's quite wrong,
p295
aVor at least it's only part of the story.
p296
aVThe Internet isn't a Pantheon.
p297
aVIt's more like the invention of concrete:
p298
aVimportant, absolutely necessary
p299
aVto build the Pantheon,
p300
aVand enduring,
p301
aVbut entirely insufficient by itself.
p302
aVHowever, just as the technology of concrete
p303
aVwas critical in realization of the Pantheon,
p304
aVnew designers will use the technologies of the Internet
p305
aVto create novel concepts that will endure.
p306
aVThe smartphone is a perfect example.
p307
aVSoon the majority of people on the planet
p308
aVwill have one,
p309
aVand the idea of connecting everyone
p310
aVto both knowledge and each other will endure.
p311
aa(lp312
VSo what's next?
p313
aVWhat imminent advance will be the equivalent of the Pantheon?
p314
aVThinking about this,
p315
aVI rejected many very plausible
p316
aVand dramatic breakthroughs to come,
p317
aVsuch as curing cancer.
p318
aVWhy? Because Pantheons are anchored
p319
aVin designed physical objects,
p320
aVones that inspire by simply seeing
p321
aVand experiencing them,
p322
aVand will continue to do so indefinitely.
p323
aVIt is a different kind of language, like art.
p324
aVThese other vital contributions that extend life
p325
aVand relieve suffering are, of course, critical,
p326
aVand fantastic,
p327
aVbut they're part of the continuum of
p328
aVour overall knowledge and technology,
p329
aVlike the Internet.
p330
aa(lp331
VSo what is next?
p332
aVPerhaps counterintuitively,
p333
aVI'm guessing it's a visionary idea
p334
aVfrom the late 1930s
p335
aVthat's been revived every decade since:
p336
aVautonomous vehicles.
p337
aVNow you're thinking, give me a break.
p338
aVHow can a fancy version of cruise control
p339
aVbe profound?
p340
aVLook, much of our world
p341
aVhas been designed around  roads and transportation.
p342
aVThese were as essential to the success
p343
aVof the Roman Empire
p344
aVas the interstate highway system
p345
aVto the prosperity and development
p346
aVof the United States.
p347
aVToday, these roads that interconnect our world
p348
aVare dominated by cars and trucks
p349
aVthat have remained largely unchanged
p350
aVfor 100 years.
p351
aVAlthough perhaps not obvious today,
p352
aVautonomous vehicles will be the key technology
p353
aVthat enables us to redesign our cities
p354
aVand, by extension, civilization.
p355
aVHere's why:
p356
aVOnce they become ubiquitous,
p357
aVeach year, these vehicles will save
p358
aVtens of thousands of lives in the United States alone
p359
aVand a million globally.
p360
aVAutomotive energy consumption and air pollution
p361
aVwill be cut dramatically.
p362
aVMuch of the road congestion
p363
aVin and out of our cities will disappear.
p364
aVThey will enable compelling new concepts
p365
aVin how we design cities, work,
p366
aVand the way we live.
p367
aVWe will get where we're going faster
p368
aVand society will recapture vast amounts
p369
aVof lost productivity
p370
aVnow spent sitting in traffic basically polluting.
p371
aa(lp372
VBut why now? Why do we think this is ready?
p373
aVBecause over the last 30 years,
p374
aVpeople from outside the automotive industry
p375
aVhave spent countless billions
p376
aVcreating the needed miracles,
p377
aVbut for entirely different purposes.
p378
aVIt took folks like DARPA, universities,
p379
aVand companies completely outside of the automotive industry
p380
aVto notice that if you were clever about it,
p381
aVautonomy could be done now.
p382
aVSo what are the five miracles needed for autonomous vehicles?
p383
aVOne, you need to know
p384
aVwhere you are and exactly what time it is.
p385
aVThis was solved neatly by the GPS system,
p386
aVGlobal Positioning System,
p387
aVthat the U.S. Government put in place.
p388
aVYou need to know where all the roads are,
p389
aVwhat the rules are, and where you're going.
p390
aVThe various needs of personal navigation systems,
p391
aVin-car navigation systems,
p392
aVand web-based maps address this.
p393
aVYou must have near-continuous communication
p394
aVwith high-performance computing networks
p395
aVand with others nearby
p396
aVto understand their intent.
p397
aVThe wireless technologies developed for mobile devices,
p398
aVwith some minor modifications,
p399
aVare completely suitable to solve this.
p400
aVYou'll probably want some restricted roadways
p401
aVto get started
p402
aVthat both society and its lawyers
p403
aVagree are safe to use for this.
p404
aVThis will start with the HOV lanes
p405
aVand move from there.
p406
aVBut finally, you need to recognize
p407
aVpeople, signs and objects.
p408
aVMachine vision, special sensors, and high-performance computing
p409
aVcan do a lot of this,
p410
aVbut it turns out a lot is not good enough
p411
aVwhen your family is on board.
p412
aVOccasionally, humans will  need to do sense-making.
p413
aVFor this, you might actually have to wake up
p414
aVyour passenger and ask them what the hell
p415
aVthat big lump is in the middle of the road.
p416
aVNot so bad, and it will give us a sense of purpose
p417
aVin this new world.
p418
aVBesides, once the first drivers explain
p419
aVto their confused car
p420
aVthat the giant chicken at the fork in the road
p421
aVis actually a restaurant,
p422
aVand it's okay to keep driving,
p423
aVevery other car on the surface of the Earth
p424
aVwill know that from that point on.
p425
aa(lp426
VFive miracles, mostly delivered,
p427
aVand now you just need a clear vision
p428
aVof a better world filled with autonomous vehicles
p429
aVwith seductively beautiful  and new functional designs
p430
aVplus a lot of money and hard work
p431
aVto bring it home.
p432
aVThe beginning is now only a handful of years away,
p433
aVand I predict that autonomous vehicles
p434
aVwill permanently change our world
p435
aVover the next several decades.
p436
aa(lp437
VIn conclusion, I've come to believe
p438
aVthat the ingredients for the next Pantheons
p439
aVare all around us,
p440
aVjust waiting for visionary people
p441
aVwith the broad knowledge,
p442
aVmultidisciplinary skills,
p443
aVand intense passion
p444
aVto harness them to make their dreams a reality.
p445
aVBut these people don't spontaneously
p446
aVpop into existence.
p447
aVThey need to be nurtured and encouraged
p448
aVfrom when they're little kids.
p449
aVWe need to love them and help them
p450
aVdiscover their passions.
p451
aVWe need to encourage them to work hard
p452
aVand help them understand that failure
p453
aVis a necessary ingredient for success,
p454
aVas is perseverance.
p455
aVWe need to help them to find their own role models,
p456
aVand give them the confidence to believe in themselves
p457
aVand to believe that anything is possible,
p458
aVand just as my grandpa did when he took me shopping for surplus,
p459
aVand just as my parents did
p460
aVwhen they took me to science museums,
p461
aVwe need to encourage them to find their own path,
p462
aVeven if it's very different from our own.
p463
aa(lp464
VBut a cautionary note:
p465
aVWe also need to periodically pry them away
p466
aVfrom their modern miracles,
p467
aVthe computers, phones, tablets,
p468
aVgame machines and TVs,
p469
aVtake them out into the sunlight
p470
aVso they can experience both the natural
p471
aVand design wonders of our world,
p472
aVour planet and our civilization.
p473
aVIf we don't, they won't understand
p474
aVwhat these precious things are
p475
aVthat someday they will be resopnsible
p476
aVfor protecting and improving.
p477
aVWe also need them to understand
p478
aVsomething that doesn't seem adequately appreciated
p479
aVin our increasingly tech-dependent world,
p480
aVthat art and design
p481
aVare not luxuries,
p482
aVnor somehow incompatible
p483
aVwith science and engineering.
p484
aVThey are in fact essential to what makes us special.
p485
aa(lp486
VSomeday, if you get the chance,
p487
aVperhaps you can take your kids
p488
aVto the actual Pantheon,
p489
aVas we will our daughter Kira,
p490
aVto experience firsthand

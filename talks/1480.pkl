VTwo weeks ago,
p5
aVI was sitting at the kitchen table with my wife Katya,
p6
aVand we were talking about what I was going to talk about today.
p7
aVWe have an 11-year-old son; his name is Lincoln.
p8
aVHe was sitting at the same table, doing his math homework.
p9
aVAnd during a pause in my conversation with Katya,
p10
aVI looked over at Lincoln
p11
aVand I was suddenly thunderstruck
p12
aVby a recollection of a client of mine.
p13
aa(lp14
VMy client was a guy named Will.
p15
aVHe was from North Texas.
p16
aVHe never knew his father very well,
p17
aVbecause his father left his mom while she was pregnant with him.
p18
aVAnd so, he was destined to be raised by a single mom,
p19
aVwhich might have been all right
p20
aVexcept that this particular single mom was a paranoid schizophrenic,
p21
aVand when Will was five years old,
p22
aVshe tried to kill him with a butcher knife.
p23
aa(lp24
VShe was taken away by authorities and placed in a psychiatric hospital,
p25
aVand so for the next several years Will lived with his older brother,
p26
aVuntil he committed suicide by shooting himself through the heart.
p27
aVAnd after that Will bounced around from one family member to another,
p28
aVuntil, by the time he was nine years old, he was essentially living on his own.
p29
aa(lp30
VThat morning that I was sitting with Katya and Lincoln,
p31
aVI looked at my son, and I realized that when my client, Will, was his age,
p32
aVhe'd been living by himself for two years.
p33
aVWill eventually joined a gang
p34
aVand committed a number of very serious crimes,
p35
aVincluding, most seriously of all,
p36
aVa horrible, tragic murder.
p37
aVAnd Will was ultimately executed as punishment for that crime.
p38
aa(lp39
VBut I don't want to talk today about the morality of capital punishment.
p40
aVI certainly think that my client shouldn't have been executed,
p41
aVbut what I would like to do today instead
p42
aVis talk about the death penalty in a way I've never done before,
p43
aVin a way that is entirely noncontroversial.
p44
aa(lp45
VI think that's possible,
p46
aVbecause there is a corner of the death penalty debate \u2014
p47
aVmaybe the most important corner \u2014
p48
aVwhere everybody agrees,
p49
aVwhere the most ardent death penalty supporters
p50
aVand the most vociferous abolitionists are on exactly the same page.
p51
aVThat's the corner I want to explore.
p52
aa(lp53
VBefore I do that, though, I want to spend a couple of minutes
p54
aVtelling you how a death penalty case unfolds,
p55
aVand then I want to tell you two lessons
p56
aVthat I have learned over the last 20 years as a death penalty lawyer
p57
aVfrom watching well more than a hundred cases unfold in this way.
p58
aa(lp59
VYou can think of a death penalty case as a story that has four chapters.
p60
aVThe first chapter of every case is exactly the same, and it is tragic.
p61
aVIt begins with the murder of an innocent human being,
p62
aVand it's followed by a trial
p63
aVwhere the murderer is convicted and sent to death row,
p64
aVand that death sentence is ultimately upheld by the state appellate court.
p65
aa(lp66
VThe second chapter consists of a complicated legal proceeding
p67
aVknown as a state habeas corpus appeal.
p68
aVThe third chapter is an even more complicated legal proceeding
p69
aVknown as a federal habeas corpus proceeding.
p70
aVAnd the fourth chapter is one where a variety of things can happen.
p71
aVThe lawyers might file a clemency petition,
p72
aVthey might initiate even more complex litigation,
p73
aVor they might not do anything at all.
p74
aVBut that fourth chapter always ends with an execution.
p75
aa(lp76
VWhen I started representing death row inmates more than 20 years ago,
p77
aVpeople on death row did not have a right to a lawyer
p78
aVin either the second or the fourth chapter of this story.
p79
aVThey were on their own.
p80
aVIn fact, it wasn't until the late 1980s
p81
aVthat they acquired a right to a lawyer during the third chapter of the story.
p82
aVSo what all of these death row inmates had to do was rely on volunteer lawyers
p83
aVto handle their legal proceedings.
p84
aVThe problem is that there were way more guys on death row
p85
aVthan there were lawyers
p86
aVwho had both the interest and the expertise to work on these cases.
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd so inevitably,
p89
aVlawyers drifted to cases that were already in chapter four \u2014
p90
aVthat makes sense, of course.
p91
aVThose are the cases that are most urgent;
p92
aVthose are the guys who are closest to being executed.
p93
aVSome of these lawyers were successful;
p94
aVthey managed to get new trials for their clients.
p95
aVOthers of them managed to extend the lives of their clients,
p96
aVsometimes by years, sometimes by months.
p97
aa(lp98
VBut the one thing that didn't happen
p99
aVwas that there was never a serious and sustained decline
p100
aVin the number of annual executions in Texas.
p101
aVIn fact, as you can see from this graph,
p102
aVfrom the time that the Texas execution apparatus got efficient
p103
aVin the mid- to late 1990s,
p104
aVthere have only been a couple of years
p105
aVwhere the number of annual executions dipped below 20.
p106
aa(lp107
VIn a typical year in Texas,
p108
aVwe're averaging about two people a month.
p109
aVIn some years in Texas, we've executed close to 40 people,
p110
aVand this number has never significantly declined over the last 15 years.
p111
aVAnd yet, at the same time that we continue to execute
p112
aVabout the same number of people every year,
p113
aVthe number of people who we're sentencing to death on an annual basis
p114
aVhas dropped rather steeply.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo we have this paradox,
p117
aVwhich is that the number of annual executions has remained high
p118
aVbut the number of new death sentences has gone down.
p119
aVWhy is that?
p120
aVIt can't be attributed to a decline in the murder rate,
p121
aVbecause the murder rate has not declined nearly so steeply
p122
aVas the red line on that graph has gone down.
p123
aVWhat has happened instead
p124
aVis that juries have started to sentence more and more people to prison
p125
aVfor the rest of their lives without the possibility of parole,
p126
aVrather than sending them to the execution chamber.
p127
aa(lp128
VWhy has that happened?
p129
aVIt hasn't happened because of a dissolution
p130
aVof popular support for the death penalty.
p131
aVDeath penalty opponents take great solace in the fact
p132
aVthat death penalty support in Texas is at an all-time low.
p133
aVDo you know what all-time low in Texas means?
p134
aVIt means that it's in the low 60 percent.
p135
aVNow, that's really good compared to the mid-1980s,
p136
aVwhen it was in excess of 80 percent,
p137
aVbut we can't explain the decline in death sentences
p138
aVand the affinity for life without the possibility of parole
p139
aVby an erosion of support for the death penalty,
p140
aVbecause people still support the death penalty.
p141
aa(lp142
VWhat's happened to cause this phenomenon?
p143
aVWhat's happened is that lawyers who represent death row inmates
p144
aVhave shifted their focus to earlier and earlier chapters
p145
aVof the death penalty story.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo 25 years ago, they focused on chapter four.
p148
aVAnd they went from chapter four 25 years ago
p149
aVto chapter three in the late 1980s.
p150
aVAnd they went from chapter three in the late 1980s
p151
aVto chapter two in the mid-1990s.
p152
aVAnd beginning in the mid- to late 1990s,
p153
aVthey began to focus on chapter one of the story.
p154
aa(lp155
VNow, you might think that this decline in death sentences
p156
aVand the increase in the number of life sentences
p157
aVis a good thing or a bad thing.
p158
aVI don't want to have a conversation about that today.
p159
aVAll that I want to tell you is that the reason that this has happened
p160
aVis because death penalty lawyers have understood
p161
aVthat the earlier you intervene in a case,
p162
aVthe greater the likelihood that you're going to save your client's life.
p163
aVThat's the first thing I've learned.
p164
aa(lp165
VHere's the second thing I learned:
p166
aVMy client Will was not the exception to the rule;
p167
aVhe was the rule.
p168
aVI sometimes say, if you tell me the name of a death row inmate \u2014
p169
aVdoesn't matter what state he's in,
p170
aVdoesn't matter if I've ever met him before \u2014
p171
aVI'll write his biography for you.
p172
aVAnd eight out of 10 times,
p173
aVthe details of that biography will be more or less accurate.
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd the reason for that is that 80 percent of the people on death row
p176
aVare people who came from the same sort of dysfunctional family that Will did.
p177
aVEighty percent of the people on death row
p178
aVare people who had exposure to the juvenile justice system.
p179
aVThat's the second lesson that I've learned.
p180
aa(lp181
VNow we're right on the cusp of that corner
p182
aVwhere everybody's going to agree.
p183
aVPeople in this room might disagree
p184
aVabout whether Will should have been executed,
p185
aVbut I think everybody would agree
p186
aVthat the best possible version of his story
p187
aVwould be a story where no murder ever occurs.
p188
aVHow do we do that?
p189
aa(lp190
VWhen our son Lincoln was working on that math problem two weeks ago,
p191
aVit was a big, gnarly problem.
p192
aVAnd he was learning how, when you have a big old gnarly problem,
p193
aVsometimes the solution is to slice it into smaller problems.
p194
aVThat's what we do for most problems \u2014
p195
aVin math, in physics, even in social policy \u2014
p196
aVwe slice them into smaller, more manageable problems.
p197
aVBut every once in a while, as Dwight Eisenhower said,
p198
aVthe way you solve a problem is to make it bigger.
p199
aa(lp200
VThe way we solve this problem
p201
aVis to make the issue of the death penalty bigger.
p202
aVWe have to say, all right.
p203
aVWe have these four chapters of a death penalty story,
p204
aVbut what happens before that story begins?
p205
aVHow can we intervene in the life of a murderer
p206
aVbefore he's a murderer?
p207
aVWhat options do we have to nudge that person off of the path
p208
aVthat is going to lead to a result that everybody \u2014
p209
aVdeath penalty supporters and death penalty opponents \u2014
p210
aVstill think is a bad result:
p211
aVthe murder of an innocent human being?
p212
aa(lp213
VYou know, sometimes people say that something isn't rocket science.
p214
aVAnd by that, what they mean is rocket science is really complicated
p215
aVand this problem that we're talking about now is really simple.
p216
aVWell that's rocket science;
p217
aVthat's the mathematical expression for the thrust created by a rocket.
p218
aVWhat we're talking about today is just as complicated.
p219
aVWhat we're talking about today is also rocket science.
p220
aa(lp221
VMy client Will and 80 percent of the people on death row
p222
aVhad five chapters in their lives
p223
aVthat came before the four chapters of the death penalty story.
p224
aVI think of these five chapters as points of intervention,
p225
aVplaces in their lives
p226
aVwhen our society could've intervened in their lives
p227
aVand nudged them off of the path that they were on
p228
aVthat created a consequence that we all \u2014
p229
aVdeath penalty supporters or death penalty opponents \u2014
p230
aVsay was a bad result.
p231
aa(lp232
VNow, during each of these five chapters:
p233
aVwhen his mother was pregnant with him;
p234
aVin his early childhood years;
p235
aVwhen he was in elementary school;
p236
aVwhen he was in middle school and then high school;
p237
aVand when he was in the juvenile justice system \u2014
p238
aVduring each of those five chapters,
p239
aVthere were a wide variety of things that society could have done.
p240
aVIn fact, if we just imagine
p241
aVthat there are five different modes of intervention,
p242
aVthe way that society could intervene in each of those five chapters,
p243
aVand we could mix and match them any way we want,
p244
aVthere are 3,000 \u2014 more than 3,000 \u2014 possible strategies
p245
aVthat we could embrace
p246
aVin order to nudge kids like Will off of the path that they're on.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo I'm not standing here today with the solution.
p249
aVBut the fact that we still have a lot to learn,
p250
aVthat doesn't mean that we don't know a lot already.
p251
aVWe know from experience in other states
p252
aVthat there are a wide variety of modes of intervention
p253
aVthat we could be using in Texas,
p254
aVand in every other state that isn't using them,
p255
aVin order to prevent a consequence that we all agree is bad.
p256
aa(lp257
VI'll just mention a few.
p258
aVI won't talk today about reforming the legal system.
p259
aVThat's probably a topic
p260
aVthat is best reserved for a room full of lawyers and judges.
p261
aVInstead, let me talk about a couple of modes of intervention
p262
aVthat we can all help accomplish,
p263
aVbecause they are modes of intervention that will come about
p264
aVwhen legislators and policymakers, when taxpayers and citizens,
p265
aVagree that that's what we ought to be doing
p266
aVand that's how we ought to be spending our money.
p267
aa(lp268
VWe could be providing early childhood care
p269
aVfor economically disadvantaged and otherwise troubled kids,
p270
aVand we could be doing it for free.
p271
aVAnd we could be nudging kids like Will off of the path that we're on.
p272
aVThere are other states that do that, but we don't.
p273
aa(lp274
VWe could be providing special schools,
p275
aVat both the high school level and the middle school level,
p276
aVbut even in K-5,
p277
aVthat target economically and otherwise disadvantaged kids,
p278
aVand particularly kids who have had exposure to the juvenile justice system.
p279
aVThere are a handful of states that do that;
p280
aVTexas doesn't.
p281
aa(lp282
VThere's one other thing we can be doing \u2014 well, there are a bunch of other things \u2014
p283
aVthere's one other thing that I'm going to mention,
p284
aVand this is going to be the only controversial thing that I say today.
p285
aVWe could be intervening much more aggressively
p286
aVinto dangerously dysfunctional homes,
p287
aVand getting kids out of them
p288
aVbefore their moms pick up butcher knives and threaten to kill them.
p289
aVIf we're going to do that, we need a place to put them.
p290
aa(lp291
VEven if we do all of those things,
p292
aVsome kids are going to fall through the cracks
p293
aVand they're going to end up in that last chapter
p294
aVbefore the murder story begins,
p295
aVthey're going to end up in the juvenile justice system.
p296
aVAnd even if that happens, it's not yet too late.
p297
aVThere's still time to nudge them,
p298
aVif we think about nudging them rather than just punishing them.
p299
aa(lp300
VThere are two professors in the Northeast \u2014
p301
aVone at Yale and one at Maryland \u2014
p302
aVthey set up a school that is attached to a juvenile prison.
p303
aVAnd the kids are in prison, but they go to school
p304
aVfrom eight in the morning until four in the afternoon.
p305
aVNow, it was logistically difficult.
p306
aVThey had to recruit teachers who wanted to teach inside a prison,
p307
aVthey had to establish strict separation
p308
aVbetween the people who work at the school and the prison authorities,
p309
aVand most dauntingly of all,
p310
aVthey needed to invent a new curriculum because you know what?
p311
aVPeople don't come into and out of prison on a semester basis.
p312
aa(lp313
V(Laughter)
p314
aa(lp315
VBut they did all those things.
p316
aa(lp317
VNow, what do all of these things have in common?
p318
aVWhat all of these things have in common is that they cost money.
p319
aVSome of the people in the room might be old enough
p320
aVto remember the guy on the old oil filter commercial.
p321
aVHe used to say, "Well, you can pay me now or you can pay me later."
p322
aVWhat we're doing in the death penalty system
p323
aVis we're paying later.
p324
aa(lp325
VBut the thing is that for every 15,000 dollars
p326
aVthat we spend intervening
p327
aVin the lives of economically and otherwise disadvantaged kids
p328
aVin those earlier chapters,
p329
aVwe save 80,000 dollars in crime-related costs down the road.
p330
aVEven if you don't agree that there's a moral imperative that we do it,
p331
aVit just makes economic sense.
p332
aa(lp333
VI want to tell you about the last conversation that I had with Will.
p334
aVIt was the day that he was going to be executed,
p335
aVand we were just talking.
p336
aVThere was nothing left to do in his case.
p337
aVAnd we were talking about his life.
p338
aVAnd he was talking first about his dad, who he hardly knew, who had died,
p339
aVand then about his mom, who he did know, who was still alive.
p340
aa(lp341
VAnd I said to him,
p342
aV"I know the story.
p343
aVI've read the records.
p344
aVI know that she tried to kill you."
p345
aVI said, "But I've always wondered
p346
aVwhether you really actually remember that."
p347
aVI said, "I don't remember anything from when I was five years old.
p348
aVMaybe you just remember somebody telling you."
p349
aa(lp350
VAnd he looked at me and he leaned forward,
p351
aVand he said, "Professor," \u2014
p352
aVhe'd known me for 12 years, he still called me Professor.
p353
aVHe said, "Professor, I don't mean any disrespect by this,
p354
aVbut when your mama picks up a butcher knife
p355
aVthat looks bigger than you are,
p356
aVand chases you through the house screaming she's going to kill you,
p357
aVand you have to lock yourself in the bathroom
p358
aVand lean against the door
p359
aVand holler for help until the police get there,"
p360
aVhe looked at me and he said,
p361
aV"that's something you don't forget."
p362
aa(lp363
VI hope there's one thing you all won't forget:
p364
aVIn between the time you arrived here this morning
p365
aVand the time we break for lunch,
p366
aVthere are going to be four homicides in the United States.
p367
aVWe're going to devote enormous social resources
p368
aVto punishing the people who commit those crimes,
p369
aVand that's appropriate
p370
aVbecause we should punish people who do bad things.
p371
aVBut three of those crimes are preventable.
p372
aa(lp373
VIf we make the picture bigger
p374
aVand devote our attention to the earlier chapters,
p375
aVthen we're never going to write the first sentence
p376
aVthat begins the death penalty story.
p377
aa(lp378
VThank you.

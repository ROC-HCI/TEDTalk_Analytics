VI have spent the past few years
p5
aVputting myself into situations
p6
aVthat are usually very difficult
p7
aVand at the same time somewhat dangerous.
p8
aVI went to prison \u2014
p9
aVdifficult.
p10
aVI worked in a coal mine \u2014
p11
aVdangerous.
p12
aVI filmed in war zones \u2014
p13
aVdifficult and dangerous.
p14
aVAnd I spent 30 days eating nothing but this \u2014
p15
aVfun in the beginning,
p16
aVlittle difficult in the middle, very dangerous in the end.
p17
aVIn fact, most of my career,
p18
aVI've been immersing myself
p19
aVinto seemingly horrible situations
p20
aVfor the whole goal of trying
p21
aVto examine societal issues
p22
aVin a way that make them engaging, that make them interesting,
p23
aVthat hopefully break them down in a way
p24
aVthat make them entertaining and accessible to an audience.
p25
aVSo when I knew I was coming here
p26
aVto do a TED Talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship,
p27
aVI knew I would want to do something a little different.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo as some of you may or may not have heard,
p30
aVa couple weeks ago, I took out an ad on eBay.
p31
aVI sent out some Facebook messages,
p32
aVsome Twitter messages,
p33
aVand I gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights
p34
aVto my 2011 TED Talk.
p35
aV(Laughter)
p36
aVThat's right, some lucky individual, corporation,
p37
aVfor-profit or non-profit,
p38
aVwas going to get the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity \u2014
p39
aVbecause I'm sure Chris Anderson will never let it happen again \u2014
p40
aV(Laughter)
p41
aVto buy the naming rights
p42
aVto the talk you're watching right now,
p43
aVthat at the time didn't have a title, didn't really have a lot of content
p44
aVand didn't really give much hint
p45
aVas to what the subject matter would actually be.
p46
aVSo what you were getting was this:
p47
aVYour name here presents:
p48
aVMy TED Talk that you have no idea what the subject is
p49
aVand, depending on the content, could ultimately blow up in your face,
p50
aVespecially if I make you or your company look stupid for doing it.
p51
aVBut that being said,
p52
aVit's a very good media opportunity.
p53
aV(Laughter)
p54
aVYou know how many people watch these TED Talks?
p55
aVIt's a lot.
p56
aVThat's just a working title, by the way.
p57
aV(Laughter)
p58
aVSo even with that caveat,
p59
aVI knew that someone would buy the naming rights.
p60
aa(lp61
VNow if you'd have asked me that a year ago,
p62
aVI wouldn't have been able to tell you that with any certainty.
p63
aVBut in the new project that I'm working on, my new film,
p64
aVwe examine the world of marketing, advertising.
p65
aVAnd as I said earlier,
p66
aVI put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years,
p67
aVbut nothing could prepare me, nothing could ready me,
p68
aVfor anything as difficult
p69
aVor as dangerous
p70
aVas going into the rooms with these guys.
p71
aV(Laughter)
p72
aVYou see, I had this idea for a movie.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Video) Morgan Spurlock: What I want to do is make a film
p75
aVall about product placement, marketing and advertising,
p76
aVwhere the entire film is funded
p77
aVby product placement, marketing and advertising.
p78
aVSo the movie will be called "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold."
p79
aVSo what happens in "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold,"
p80
aVis that everything from top to bottom, from start to finish,
p81
aVis branded from beginning to end \u2014
p82
aVfrom the above-the-title sponsor that you'll see in the movie,
p83
aVwhich is brand X.
p84
aVNow this brand, the Qualcomm Stadium,
p85
aVthe Staples Center ...
p86
aVthese people will be married to the film in perpetuity \u2014 forever.
p87
aVAnd so the film explores this whole idea \u2014 (Michael Kassan: It's redundant.)
p88
aVIt's what? (MK: It's redundant.) In perpetuity, forever?
p89
aVI'm a redundant person. (MK: I'm just saying.)
p90
aVThat was more for emphasis.
p91
aVIt was, "In perpetuity. Forever."
p92
aVBut not only are we going to have the brand X title sponsor,
p93
aVbut we're going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film.
p94
aVSo maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore ...
p95
aVthe greatest car you ever drove from "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold,"
p96
aVthe greatest drink you've ever had, courtesy of "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold."
p97
aa(lp98
VXavier Kochhar: So the idea is,
p99
aVbeyond just showing that brands are a part of your life,
p100
aVbut actually get them to finance the film? (MS: Get them to finance the film.)
p101
aa(lp102
VMS: And actually we show the whole process of how does it work.
p103
aVThe goal of this whole film is transparency.
p104
aVYou're going to see the whole thing take place in this movie.
p105
aVSo that's the whole concept,
p106
aVthe whole film, start to finish.
p107
aVAnd I would love for CEG to help make it happen.
p108
aa(lp109
VRobert Friedman: You know it's funny,
p110
aVbecause when I first hear it,
p111
aVit is the ultimate respect
p112
aVfor an audience.
p113
aa(lp114
VGuy: I don't know how receptive
p115
aVpeople are going to be to it, though.
p116
aa(lp117
VXK: Do you have a perspective \u2014
p118
aVI don't want to use "angle" because that has a negative connotation \u2014
p119
aVbut do you know how this is going to play out? (MS: No idea.)
p120
aa(lp121
VDavid Cohn: How much money does it take to do this?
p122
aa(lp123
VMS: 1.5 million. (DC: Okay.)
p124
aa(lp125
VJohn Kamen: I think that you're going to have a hard time meeting with them,
p126
aVbut I think it's certainly worth pursuing
p127
aVa couple big, really obvious brands.
p128
aa(lp129
VXK: Who knows, maybe by the time your film comes out,
p130
aVwe look like a bunch of blithering idiots.
p131
aa(lp132
VMS: What do you think the response is going to be?
p133
aa(lp134
VStuart Ruderfer: The responses mostly will be "no."
p135
aa(lp136
VMS: But is it a tough sell because of the film
p137
aVor a tough sell because of me?
p138
aa(lp139
VJK: Both.
p140
aa(lp141
VMS: ... Meaning not so optimistic.
p142
aVSo, sir, can you help me? I need help.
p143
aa(lp144
VMK: I can help you.
p145
aa(lp146
VMS: Okay. (MK: Good.)
p147
aVAwesome.
p148
aa(lp149
VMK: We've gotta figure out which brands.
p150
aa(lp151
VMS: Yeah. (MK: That's the challenge.)
p152
aVWhen you look at the people you deal with ..
p153
aa(lp154
VMK: We've got some places we can go. (MS: Okay.)
p155
aVTurn the camera off.
p156
aa(lp157
VMS: I thought "Turn the camera off"
p158
aVmeant, "Let's have an off-the-record conversation."
p159
aVTurns out it really means,
p160
aV"We want nothing to do with your movie."
p161
aa(lp162
VMS: And just like that, one by one,
p163
aVall of these companies suddenly disappeared.
p164
aVNone of them wanted anything to do with this movie.
p165
aVI was amazed.
p166
aVThey wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project.
p167
aVAnd I was blown away, because I thought the whole concept, the idea of advertising,
p168
aVwas to get your product out in front of as many people as possible,
p169
aVto get as many people to see it as possible.
p170
aVEspecially in today's world,
p171
aVthis intersection of new media and old media
p172
aVand the fractured media landscape,
p173
aVisn't the idea to get
p174
aVthat new buzz-worthy delivery vehicle
p175
aVthat's going to get that message to the masses?
p176
aVNo, that's what I thought.
p177
aa(lp178
VBut the problem was, you see,
p179
aVmy idea had one fatal flaw,
p180
aVand that flaw was this.
p181
aVActually no, that was not the flaw whatsoever.
p182
aVThat wouldn't have been a problem at all.
p183
aVThis would have been fine.
p184
aVBut what this image represents was the problem.
p185
aVSee, when you do a Google image search for transparency,
p186
aVthis is \u2014-
p187
aV(Laughter)
p188
aV(Applause)
p189
aVThis is one of the first images that comes up.
p190
aVSo I like the way you roll, Sergey Brin. No.
p191
aV(Laughter)
p192
aVThis is was the problem: transparency \u2014
p193
aVfree from pretense or deceit;
p194
aVeasily detected or seen through;
p195
aVreadily understood;
p196
aVcharacterized by visibility or accessibility of information,
p197
aVespecially concerning business practices \u2014
p198
aVthat last line being probably the biggest problem.
p199
aVYou see, we hear a lot about transparency these days.
p200
aVOur politicians say it, our president says it,
p201
aVeven our CEO's say it.
p202
aVBut suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality,
p203
aVsomething suddenly changes.
p204
aVBut why? Well, transparency is scary \u2014
p205
aV(Roar)
p206
aVlike that odd, still-screaming bear.
p207
aV(Laughter)
p208
aVIt's unpredictable \u2014
p209
aV(Music)
p210
aV(Laughter)
p211
aVlike this odd country road.
p212
aVAnd it's also very risky.
p213
aV(Laughter)
p214
aVWhat else is risky?
p215
aVEating an entire bowl of Cool Whip.
p216
aV(Laughter)
p217
aVThat's very risky.
p218
aa(lp219
VNow when I started talking to companies
p220
aVand telling them that we wanted to tell this story,
p221
aVand they said, "No, we want you to tell a story.
p222
aVWe want you to tell a story,
p223
aVbut we just want to tell our story."
p224
aVSee, when I was a kid
p225
aVand my father would catch me in some sort of a lie \u2014
p226
aVand there he is giving me the look he often gave me \u2014
p227
aVhe would say, "Son, there's three sides to every story.
p228
aVThere's your story,
p229
aVthere's my story
p230
aVand there's the real story."
p231
aVNow you see, with this film, we wanted to tell the real story.
p232
aVBut with only one company, one agency willing to help me \u2014
p233
aVand that's only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years \u2014
p234
aVI realized that I would have to go on my own,
p235
aVI'd have to cut out the middleman
p236
aVand go to the companies myself with all of my team.
p237
aVSo what you suddenly started to realize \u2014
p238
aVor what I started to realize \u2014
p239
aVis that when you started having conversations with these companies,
p240
aVthe idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
p241
aa(lp242
V(Video) MS: I have friends who make great big, giant Hollywood films,
p243
aVand I have friends who make little independent films like I make.
p244
aVAnd the friends of mine who make big, giant Hollywood movies
p245
aVsay the reason their films are so successful
p246
aVis because of the brand partners that they have.
p247
aVAnd then my friends who make small independent films
p248
aVsay, "Well, how are we supposed to compete
p249
aVwith these big, giant Hollywood movies?"
p250
aVAnd the movie is called
p251
aV"The Greatest Movie Ever Sold."
p252
aVSo how specifically will we see Ban in the film?
p253
aVAny time I'm ready to go, any time I open up my medicine cabinet,
p254
aVyou will see Ban deodorant.
p255
aVWhile anytime I do an interview with someone,
p256
aVI can say, "Are you fresh enough for this interview?
p257
aVAre you ready? You look a little nervous.
p258
aVI want to help you calm down.
p259
aVSo maybe you should put some one before the interview."
p260
aVSo we'll offer one of these fabulous scents.
p261
aVWhether it's a "Floral Fusion" or a "Paradise Winds,"
p262
aVthey'll have their chance.
p263
aVWe will have them geared for both male or female \u2014
p264
aVsolid, roll-on or stick, whatever it may be.
p265
aVThat's the two-cent tour.
p266
aVSo now I can answer any of your questions
p267
aVand give you the five-cent tour.
p268
aa(lp269
VKaren Frank: We are a smaller brand.
p270
aVMuch like you talked about being a smaller movie,
p271
aVwe're very much a challenger brand.
p272
aVSo we don't have the budgets that other brands have.
p273
aVSo doing things like this \u2014 you know,
p274
aVremind people about Ban \u2014
p275
aVis kind of why were interested in it.
p276
aa(lp277
VMS: What are the words that you would use to describe Ban?
p278
aVBan is blank.
p279
aa(lp280
VKF: That's a great question.
p281
aa(lp282
V(Laughter)
p283
aa(lp284
VWoman: Superior technology.
p285
aa(lp286
VMS: Technology's not the way you want to describe something
p287
aVsomebody's putting in their armpit.
p288
aa(lp289
VMan: We talk about bold, fresh.
p290
aVI think "fresh" is a great word that really spins this category into the positive,
p291
aVversus "fights odor and wetness."
p292
aVIt keeps you fresh.
p293
aVHow do we keep you fresher longer \u2014 better freshness,
p294
aVmore freshness, three times fresher.
p295
aVThings like that that are more of that positive benefit.
p296
aa(lp297
VMS: And that's a multi-million dollar corporation.
p298
aVWhat about me? What about a regular guy?
p299
aVI need to go talk to the man on the street,
p300
aVthe people who are like me, the regular Joes.
p301
aVThey need to tell me about my brand.
p302
aa(lp303
V(Video) MS: How would you guys describe your brand?
p304
aa(lp305
VMan: Um, my brand?
p306
aVI don't know.
p307
aVI like really nice clothes.
p308
aa(lp309
VWoman: 80's revival
p310
aVmeets skater-punk,
p311
aVunless it's laundry day.
p312
aa(lp313
VMS: All right, what is brand Gerry?
p314
aa(lp315
VGerry: Unique. (MS: Unique.)
p316
aa(lp317
VMan: I guess what kind of genre, style I am
p318
aVwould be like dark glamor.
p319
aVI like a lot of black colors,
p320
aVa lot of grays and stuff like that.
p321
aVBut usually I have an accessory,
p322
aVlike sunglasses,
p323
aVor I like crystal and things like that too.
p324
aa(lp325
VWoman: If Dan were a brand,
p326
aVhe might be a classic convertible
p327
aVMercedes Benz.
p328
aa(lp329
VMan 2: The brand that I am
p330
aVis, I would call it casual fly.
p331
aa(lp332
VWoman 2: Part hippie, part yogi,
p333
aVpart Brooklyn girl \u2014 I don't know.
p334
aa(lp335
VMan 3: I'm the pet guy.
p336
aVI sell pet toys all over the country, all over the world.
p337
aVSo I guess that's my brand.
p338
aVIn my warped little industry, that's my brand.
p339
aa(lp340
VMan 4: My brand is FedEx because I deliver the goods.
p341
aa(lp342
VMan 5: Failed writer-alcoholic brand.
p343
aVIs that something?
p344
aa(lp345
VLawyer: I'm a lawyer brand.
p346
aa(lp347
VTom: I'm Tom.
p348
aa(lp349
VMS: Well we can't all be brand Tom, but I do often find myself
p350
aVat the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly.
p351
aa(lp352
V(Laughter)
p353
aa(lp354
VAnd what I realized is I needed an expert.
p355
aVI needed somebody who could get inside my head,
p356
aVsomebody who could really help me understand
p357
aVwhat they call your "brand personality."
p358
aVAnd so I found a company called Olson Zaltman in Pittsburg.
p359
aVThey've helped companies like Nestle, Febreze, Hallmark
p360
aVdiscover that brand personality.
p361
aVIf they could do it for them, surely they could do it for me.
p362
aa(lp363
V(Video) Abigail: You brought your pictures, right?
p364
aa(lp365
VMS: I did. The very first picture
p366
aVis a picture of my family.
p367
aa(lp368
VA: So tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are.
p369
aa(lp370
VMS: These are the people who shape the way I look at the world.
p371
aa(lp372
VA: Tell me about this world.
p373
aa(lp374
VMS: This world? I think your world is the world that you live in \u2014
p375
aVlike people who are around you, your friends, your family,
p376
aVthe way you live your life, the job you do.
p377
aVAll those things stemmed and started from one place,
p378
aVand for me they stemmed and started with my family in West Virginia.
p379
aa(lp380
VA: What's the next one you want to talk about?
p381
aa(lp382
VMS: The next one: This was the best day ever.
p383
aa(lp384
VA: How does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are?
p385
aa(lp386
VMS: It's like, who do I want to be?
p387
aVI like things that are different.
p388
aVI like things that are weird. I like weird things.
p389
aa(lp390
VA: Tell me about the "why" phase \u2014 what does that do for us?
p391
aVWhat is the machete? What pupa stage are you in now?
p392
aVWhy is it important to reboot? What does the red represent?
p393
aVTell me a little bit about that part.
p394
aV... A little more about you that is not who you are.
p395
aVWhat are some other metamorphoses that you've had?
p396
aV... Doesn't have to be fear. What kind of roller coaster are you on?
p397
aa(lp398
VMS: EEEEEE! (A: Thank you.) No, thank you.
p399
aa(lp400
VA: Thanks for you patience. (MS: Great job.)
p401
aa(lp402
VA: Yeah. (MS: Thanks a lot.) All right.
p403
aa(lp404
VMS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come of this.
p405
aVThere was a whole lot of crazy going on in there.
p406
aa(lp407
VLindsay Zaltman: The first thing we saw was this idea
p408
aVthat you had two distinct, but complementary
p409
aVsides to your brand personality \u2014
p410
aVthe Morgan Spurlock brand is a mindful/play brand.
p411
aVThose are juxtaposed very nicely together.
p412
aVAnd I think there's almost a paradox with those.
p413
aVAnd I think some companies
p414
aVwill just focus on one of their strengths or the other
p415
aVinstead of focusing on both.
p416
aVMost companies tend to \u2014 and it's human nature \u2014
p417
aVto avoid things that they're not sure of,
p418
aVavoid fear, those elements,
p419
aVand you really embrace those,
p420
aVand you actually turn them into positives for you, and it's a neat thing to see.
p421
aVWhat other brands are like that?
p422
aVThe first on here is the classic, Apple.
p423
aVAnd you can see here too, Target, Wii,
p424
aVMini from the Mini Coopers, and JetBlue.
p425
aVNow there's playful brands and mindful brands,
p426
aVthose things that have come and gone,
p427
aVbut a playful, mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing.
p428
aa(lp429
VMS: A playful, mindful brand. What is your brand?
p430
aVIf somebody asked you to describe your brand identity, your brand personality,
p431
aVwhat would you be?
p432
aVAre you an up attribute? Are you something that gets the blood flowing?
p433
aVOr are you more of a down attribute?
p434
aVAre you something that's a little more calm, reserved, conservative?
p435
aVUp attributes are things like being playful,
p436
aVbeing fresh like the Fresh Prince,
p437
aVcontemporary, adventurous,
p438
aVedgy or daring like Errol Flynn,
p439
aVnimble or agile, profane, domineering,
p440
aVmagical or mystical like Gandalf.
p441
aVOr are you more of a down attribute?
p442
aVAre you mindful, sophisticated like 007?
p443
aVAre you established, traditional, nurturing, protective,
p444
aVempathetic like the Oprah?
p445
aVAre you reliable, stable, familiar,
p446
aVsafe, secure, sacred,
p447
aVcontemplative or wise
p448
aVlike the Dalai Lama or Yoda?
p449
aa(lp450
VOver the course of this film,
p451
aVwe had 500-plus companies
p452
aVwho were up and down companies
p453
aVsaying, "no," they didn't want any part of this project.
p454
aVThey wanted nothing to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control,
p455
aVthey would have no control over the final product.
p456
aVBut we did get 17 brand partners
p457
aVwho were willing to relinquish that control,
p458
aVwho wanted to be in business
p459
aVwith someone as mindful and as playful as myself
p460
aVand who ultimately empowered us to tell stories
p461
aVthat normally we wouldn't be able to tell \u2014
p462
aVstories that an advertiser would normally never get behind.
p463
aa(lp464
VThey enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing,
p465
aVas we got into telling the story in this film
p466
aVabout how now they're using MRI's
p467
aVto target the desire centers of your brain
p468
aVfor both commercials as well as movie marketing.
p469
aVWe went to San Paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising.
p470
aVIn the entire city for the past five years,
p471
aVthere's no billboards, there's no posters, there's no flyers, nothing.
p472
aV(Applause)
p473
aVAnd we went to school districts
p474
aVwhere now companies are making their way
p475
aVinto cash-strapped schools all across America.
p476
aVWhat's incredible for me is the projects that I've gotten the most feedback out of,
p477
aVor I've had the most success in,
p478
aVare ones where I've interacted with things directly.
p479
aa(lp480
VAnd that's what these brands did.
p481
aVThey cut out the middleman, they cut out their agencies
p482
aVand said, "Maybe these agencies
p483
aVdon't have my best interest in mind.
p484
aVI'm going to deal directly with the artist.
p485
aVI'm going to work with him to create something different,
p486
aVsomething that's going to get people thinking,
p487
aVthat's going to challenge the way we look at the world."
p488
aa(lp489
VAnd how has that been for them? Has it been successful?
p490
aVWell, since the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, let's take a look.
p491
aVAccording to Burrelles, the movie premiered in January,
p492
aVand since then \u2014 and this isn't even the whole thing \u2014
p493
aVwe've had 900 million media impressions for this film.
p494
aVThat's literally covering just like a two and a half-week period.
p495
aVThat's only online \u2014 no print, no TV.
p496
aVThe film hasn't even been distributed yet.
p497
aVIt's not even online. It's not even streaming.
p498
aVIt's not even been out into other foreign countries yet.
p499
aVSo ultimately,
p500
aVthis film has already started to gain a lot of momentum.
p501
aVAnd not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to
p502
aVadvised their clients not to take part.
p503
aa(lp504
VWhat I always believe
p505
aVis that if you take chances, if you take risks,
p506
aVthat in those risks will come opportunity.
p507
aVI believe that when you push people away from that,
p508
aVyou're pushing them more towards failure.
p509
aVI believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse,
p510
aVthen you're preparing your whole company
p511
aVto be reward challenged.
p512
aVI feel like that what has to happen moving forward
p513
aVis we need to encourage people to take risks.
p514
aVWe need to encourage people to not be afraid
p515
aVof opportunities that may scare them.
p516
aVUltimately, moving forward,
p517
aVI think we have to embrace fear.
p518
aVWe've got to put that bear in a cage.
p519
aV(Laughter)
p520
aVEmbrace fear. Embrace risk.
p521
aVOne big spoonful at a time, we have to embrace risk.
p522
aa(lp523
VAnd ultimately, we have to embrace transparency.
p524
aVToday, more than ever,
p525
aVa little honesty is going to go a long way.
p526
aVAnd that being said, through honesty and transparency,
p527
aVmy entire talk, "Embrace Transparency,"
p528
aVhas been brought to you
p529
aVby my good friends at EMC,
p530
aVwho for $7,100
p531
aVbought the naming rights on eBay.
p532
aV(Applause)
p533
aVEMC: Turning big data
p534
aVinto big opportunity
p535
aVfor organizations all over the world.
p536
aVEMC presents: "Embrace Transparency."
p537
aa(lp538
VThank you very much, guys.
p539
aa(lp540
V(Applause)
p541
aa(lp542
VJune Cohen: So, Morgan,
p543
aVin the name of transparency,
p544
aVwhat exactly happened to that $7,100?
p545
aVMS: That is a fantastic question.
p546
aVI have in my pocket a check
p547
aVmade out to the parent organization to the TED organization,
p548
aVthe Sapling Foundation \u2014
p549
aVa check for $7,100
p550
aVto be applied toward my attendance for next year's TED.

And &quot;host&quot; can be taken literally: eating only McDonald&#39;s for 30 days straight, Spurlock went into a shocking physical and emotional decline, showing via his own body the truth about junk food. After this Oscar-nominated doc came Spurlock&#39;s three-seasons-long unscripted TV show, <em>30 Days</em>, based on another lifehack: Send a person to live, for 30 days, inside another worldview. Stories from <em>30 Days</em> are human, engaging, surprising: An anti-immigrant activist warms to a tight-knit family of border-crossers; an outsourced US engineer meets the Indian engineer who holds his old job; a former pro football player spends 30 days navigating the world in a wheelchair.</p><p>In 2008, Spurlock released&nbsp;<em><a href=\\"http://geni.us/whereintheworld\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Where in the World Is Osama Bin Laden?</a>,</em>&nbsp;about his months-long trek through Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel, Palestine ... following leads and interviewing people along the way. (In an interview, he guessed he got within 50 miles of Osama before winding up the hunt.) He was also part of a group-filmed version of <em>Freakonomics</em>. He wrote a book about his fast-food odyssey, called&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/donteatthisbook\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Don&#39;t Eat This Book</em></a>&nbsp;-- while his wife, vegan chef Alex Jamieson, wrote a bestseller about the eight-week cleansing diet she put Spurlock on after he got supersized.</p><p>His latest film,&nbsp;<em><a href=\\"http://geni.us/greatestmovieever\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The Greatest Movie Ever Sold</a>,</em>&nbsp;dives into the  mysterious world of brand sponsorship, a major influence on how pop culture is developed and shared. Almost  totally sponsored itself, the film was the first to be sold at Sundance 2011,  and, it&#39;s said, made a profit before it even opened.

any reality-TV show, Morgan Spurlock&#39;s 2004 film&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/supersizeme\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Super Size Me</em></a>&nbsp;was something else entirely: a critique of modern fast-feeding, wrapped in the personal story of a charming, curious host. And &quot;host&quot; can be taken literally: eating only McDonald&#39;s for 30 days straight, Spurlock went into a shocking physical and emotional decline, showing via his own body the truth about junk food. After this Oscar-nominated doc came Spurlock&#39;s three-seasons-long unscripted TV show, <em>30 Days</em>, based on another lifehack: Send a person to live, for 30 days, inside another worldview. Stories from <em>30 Days</em> are human, engaging, surprising: An anti-immigrant activist warms to a tight-knit family of border-crossers; an outsourced US engineer meets the Indian engineer who holds his old job; a former pro football player spends 30 days navigating the world in a wheelchair.</p><p>In 2008, Spurlock released&nbsp;<em><a href=\\"http://geni.us/whereintheworld\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Where in the World Is Osama Bin Laden?</a>,</em>&nbsp;about his months-long trek through Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel, Palestine ... following leads and interviewing people along the way. (In an interview, he guessed he got within 50 miles of Osama before winding up the hunt.) He was also part of a group-filmed version of <em>Freakonomics</em>. He wrote a book about his fast-food odyssey, called&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://geni.us/donteatthisbook\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Don&#39;t Eat This Book</em></a>&nbsp;-- while his wife, vegan chef Alex Jamieson, wrote a bestseller about the eight-week cleansing diet she put Spurlock on after he got supersized.</p><p>His latest film,&nbsp;<em><a href=\\"http://geni.us/greatestmovieever\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The Greatest Movie Ever Sold</a>,</em>&nbsp;dives into the  mysterious world of brand sponsorship, a major influence on how pop culture is developed and shared. Almost  totally sponsored itself, the film was the first to be sold at Sundance 2011,  and, it&#39;s said, made a profit before it even opened. The film debuts in  US theaters on April 22, 2011.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>", "slug": "morgan_spurlock", "whotheyare": "Morgan Spurlock makes documentary film and TV that is personal, political -- and, above all, deeply empathetic.", "whatotherssay": "In the U.S., we\'ve given corporations all the powers and freedoms of an individual but with none of the responsibility.

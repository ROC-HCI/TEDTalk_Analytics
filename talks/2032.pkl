VEvery day we face issues like climate change
p5
aVor the safety of vaccines
p6
aVwhere we have to answer questions whose answers
p7
aVrely heavily on scientific information.
p8
aVScientists tell us that the world is warming.
p9
aVScientists tell us that vaccines are safe.
p10
aVBut how do we know if they are right?
p11
aVWhy should be believe the science?
p12
aVThe fact is, many of us actually don't believe the science.
p13
aVPublic opinion polls consistently show
p14
aVthat significant proportions of the American people
p15
aVdon't believe the climate is warming due to human activities,
p16
aVdon't think that there is evolution by natural selection,
p17
aVand aren't persuaded by the safety of vaccines.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo why should we believe the science?
p20
aVWell, scientists don't like talking about  science as a matter of belief.
p21
aVIn fact, they would contrast science with faith,
p22
aVand they would say belief is the domain of faith.
p23
aVAnd faith is a separate thing apart and distinct from science.
p24
aVIndeed they would say religion is based on faith
p25
aVor maybe the calculus of Pascal's wager.
p26
aVBlaise Pascal was a 17th-century mathematician
p27
aVwho tried to bring scientific reasoning to the question of
p28
aVwhether or not he should believe in God,
p29
aVand his wager went like this:
p30
aVWell, if God doesn't exist
p31
aVbut I decide to believe in him
p32
aVnothing much is really lost.
p33
aVMaybe a few hours on Sunday.
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aVBut if he does exist and I don't believe in him,
p36
aVthen I'm in deep trouble.
p37
aVAnd so Pascal said, we'd better believe in God.
p38
aVOr as one of my college professors said,
p39
aV"He clutched for the handrail of faith."
p40
aVHe made that leap of faith
p41
aVleaving science and rationalism behind.
p42
aa(lp43
VNow the fact is though, for most of us,
p44
aVmost scientific claims are a leap of faith.
p45
aVWe can't really judge scientific claims for ourselves in most cases.
p46
aVAnd indeed this is actually true for most scientists as well
p47
aVoutside of their own specialties.
p48
aVSo if you think about it, a geologist can't tell you
p49
aVwhether a vaccine is safe.
p50
aVMost chemists are not experts in evolutionary theory.
p51
aVA physicist cannot tell you,
p52
aVdespite the claims of some of them,
p53
aVwhether or not tobacco causes cancer.
p54
aVSo, if even scientists themselves
p55
aVhave to make a leap of faith
p56
aVoutside their own fields,
p57
aVthen why do they accept the claims of other scientists?
p58
aVWhy do they believe each other's claims?
p59
aVAnd should we believe those claims?
p60
aa(lp61
VSo what I'd like to argue is yes, we should,
p62
aVbut not for the reason that most of us think.
p63
aVMost of us were taught in school that the reason we should
p64
aVbelieve in science is because of the scientific method.
p65
aVWe were taught that scientists follow a method
p66
aVand that this method guarantees
p67
aVthe truth of their claims.
p68
aVThe method that most of us were taught in school,
p69
aVwe can call it the textbook method,
p70
aVis the hypothetical deductive method.
p71
aVAccording to the standard model, the textbook model,
p72
aVscientists develop hypotheses, they deduce
p73
aVthe consequences of those hypotheses,
p74
aVand then they go out into the world and they say,
p75
aV"Okay, well are those consequences true?"
p76
aVCan we observe them taking place in the natural world?
p77
aVAnd if they are true, then the scientists say,
p78
aV"Great, we know the hypothesis is correct."
p79
aa(lp80
VSo there are many famous examples in the history
p81
aVof science of scientists doing exactly this.
p82
aVOne of the most famous examples
p83
aVcomes from the work of Albert Einstein.
p84
aVWhen Einstein developed the theory of general relativity,
p85
aVone of the consequences of his theory
p86
aVwas that space-time wasn't just an empty void
p87
aVbut that it actually had a fabric.
p88
aVAnd that that fabric was bent
p89
aVin the presence of massive objects like the sun.
p90
aVSo if this theory were true then it meant that light
p91
aVas it passed the sun
p92
aVshould actually be bent around it.
p93
aVThat was a pretty startling prediction
p94
aVand it took a few years before scientists
p95
aVwere able to test it
p96
aVbut they did test it in 1919,
p97
aVand lo and behold it turned out to be true.
p98
aVStarlight actually does bend as it travels around the sun.
p99
aVThis was a huge confirmation of the theory.
p100
aVIt was considered proof of the truth
p101
aVof this radical new idea,
p102
aVand it was written up in many newspapers
p103
aVaround the globe.
p104
aa(lp105
VNow, sometimes this theory or this model
p106
aVis referred to as the deductive-nomological model,
p107
aVmainly because academics like  to make things complicated.
p108
aVBut also because in the ideal case, it's about laws.
p109
aVSo nomological means having to do with laws.
p110
aVAnd in the ideal case, the hypothesis isn't just an idea:
p111
aVideally, it is a law of nature.
p112
aVWhy does it matter that it is a law of nature?
p113
aVBecause if it is a law, it can't be broken.
p114
aVIf it's a law then it will always be true
p115
aVin all times and all places
p116
aVno matter what the circumstances are.
p117
aVAnd all of you know of at least one example of a famous law:
p118
aVEinstein's famous equation, E=MC2,
p119
aVwhich tells us what the relationship is
p120
aVbetween energy and mass.
p121
aVAnd that relationship is true no matter what.
p122
aa(lp123
VNow, it turns out, though, that there  are several problems with this model.
p124
aVThe main problem is that it's wrong.
p125
aVIt's just not true. (Laughter)
p126
aVAnd I'm going to talk about three reasons why it's wrong.
p127
aVSo the first reason is a logical reason.
p128
aVIt's the problem of the fallacy of affirming the consequent.
p129
aVSo that's another fancy, academic way of saying
p130
aVthat false theories can make true predictions.
p131
aVSo just because the prediction comes true
p132
aVdoesn't actually logically prove that the theory is correct.
p133
aVAnd I have a good example of that too,  again from the history of science.
p134
aVThis is a picture of the Ptolemaic universe
p135
aVwith the Earth at the center of the universe
p136
aVand the sun and the planets going around it.
p137
aVThe Ptolemaic model was believed
p138
aVby many very smart people for many centuries.
p139
aVWell, why?
p140
aVWell the answer is because it made  lots of predictions that came true.
p141
aVThe Ptolemaic system enabled astronomers
p142
aVto make accurate predictions of the motions of the planet,
p143
aVin fact more accurate predictions at first
p144
aVthan the Copernican theory which we now would say is true.
p145
aVSo that's one problem with the textbook model.
p146
aVA second problem is a practical problem,
p147
aVand it's the problem of auxiliary hypotheses.
p148
aVAuxiliary hypotheses are assumptions
p149
aVthat scientists are making
p150
aVthat they may or may not even be aware that they're making.
p151
aVSo an important example of this
p152
aVcomes from the Copernican model,
p153
aVwhich ultimately replaced the Ptolemaic system.
p154
aVSo when Nicolaus Copernicus said,
p155
aVactually the Earth is not the center of the universe,
p156
aVthe sun is the center of the solar system,
p157
aVthe Earth moves around the sun.
p158
aVScientists said, well okay, Nicolaus, if that's true
p159
aVwe ought to be able to detect the motion
p160
aVof the Earth around the sun.
p161
aVAnd so this slide here illustrates a concept
p162
aVknown as stellar parallax.
p163
aVAnd astronomers said, if the Earth is moving
p164
aVand we look at a prominent star, let's say, Sirius \u2014
p165
aVwell I know I'm in Manhattan so you guys can't see the stars,
p166
aVbut imagine you're out in the country,  imagine you chose that rural life \u2014
p167
aVand we look at a star in December, we see that star
p168
aVagainst the backdrop of distant stars.
p169
aVIf we now make the same observation six months later
p170
aVwhen the Earth has moved to this position in June,
p171
aVwe look at that same star and we  see it against a different backdrop.
p172
aVThat difference, that angular difference, is the stellar parallax.
p173
aVSo this is a prediction that the Copernican model makes.
p174
aVAstronomers looked for the stellar parallax
p175
aVand they found nothing, nothing at all.
p176
aVAnd many people argued that this proved  that the Copernican model was false.
p177
aa(lp178
VSo what happened?
p179
aVWell, in hindsight we can say  that astronomers were making
p180
aVtwo auxiliary hypotheses, both of which
p181
aVwe would now say were incorrect.
p182
aVThe first was an assumption  about the size of the Earth's orbit.
p183
aVAstronomers were assuming  that the Earth's orbit was large
p184
aVrelative to the distance to the stars.
p185
aVToday we would draw the picture more like this,
p186
aVthis comes from NASA,
p187
aVand you see the Earth's orbit is actually quite small.
p188
aVIn fact, it's actually much smaller even than shown here.
p189
aVThe stellar parallax therefore,
p190
aVis very small and actually very hard to detect.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd that leads to the second reason
p193
aVwhy the prediction didn't work,
p194
aVbecause scientists were also assuming
p195
aVthat the telescopes they had were sensitive enough
p196
aVto detect the parallax.
p197
aVAnd that turned out not to be true.
p198
aVIt wasn't until the 19th century
p199
aVthat scientists were able to detect
p200
aVthe stellar parallax.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo, there's a third problem as well.
p203
aVThe third problem is simply a factual problem,
p204
aVthat a lot of science doesn't fit the textbook model.
p205
aVA lot of science isn't deductive at all,
p206
aVit's actually inductive.
p207
aVAnd by that we mean that scientists don't necessarily
p208
aVstart with theories and hypotheses,
p209
aVoften they just start with observations
p210
aVof stuff going on in the world.
p211
aVAnd the most famous example of that is one of the most
p212
aVfamous scientists who ever lived, Charles Darwin.
p213
aVWhen Darwin went out as a young  man on the voyage of the Beagle,
p214
aVhe didn't have a hypothesis, he didn't have a theory.
p215
aVHe just knew that he wanted to have a career as a scientist
p216
aVand he started to collect data.
p217
aVMainly he knew that he hated medicine
p218
aVbecause the sight of blood made him sick so
p219
aVhe had to have an alternative career path.
p220
aVSo he started collecting data.
p221
aVAnd he collected many things,  including his famous finches.
p222
aVWhen he collected these finches, he threw them in a bag
p223
aVand he had no idea what they meant.
p224
aVMany years later back in London,
p225
aVDarwin looked at his data again and began
p226
aVto develop an explanation,
p227
aVand that explanation was the theory of natural selection.
p228
aa(lp229
VBesides inductive science,
p230
aVscientists also often participate in modeling.
p231
aVOne of the things scientists want to do in life
p232
aVis to explain the causes of things.
p233
aVAnd how do we do that?
p234
aVWell, one way you can do it is to build a model
p235
aVthat tests an idea.
p236
aa(lp237
VSo this is a picture of Henry Cadell,
p238
aVwho was a Scottish geologist in the 19th century.
p239
aVYou can tell he's Scottish because he's wearing
p240
aVa deerstalker cap and Wellington boots.
p241
aV(Laughter)
p242
aVAnd Cadell wanted to answer the question,
p243
aVhow are mountains formed?
p244
aVAnd one of the things he had observed
p245
aVis that if you look at mountains like the Appalachians,
p246
aVyou often find that the rocks in them
p247
aVare folded,
p248
aVand they're folded in a particular way,
p249
aVwhich suggested to him
p250
aVthat they were actually being compressed from the side.
p251
aVAnd this idea would later play a major role
p252
aVin discussions of continental drift.
p253
aVSo he built this model, this crazy contraption
p254
aVwith levers and wood, and here's his wheelbarrow,
p255
aVbuckets, a big sledgehammer.
p256
aVI don't know why he's got the Wellington boots.
p257
aVMaybe it's going to rain.
p258
aVAnd he created this physical model in order
p259
aVto demonstrate that you could, in fact, create
p260
aVpatterns in rocks, or at least, in this case, in mud,
p261
aVthat looked a lot like mountains
p262
aVif you compressed them from the side.
p263
aVSo it was an argument about the cause of mountains.
p264
aa(lp265
VNowadays, most scientists prefer to work inside,
p266
aVso they don't build physical models so much
p267
aVas to make computer simulations.
p268
aVBut a computer simulation is a kind of a model.
p269
aVIt's a model that's made with mathematics,
p270
aVand like the physical models of the 19th century,
p271
aVit's very important for thinking about causes.
p272
aVSo one of the big questions to do with climate change,
p273
aVwe have tremendous amounts of evidence
p274
aVthat the Earth is warming up.
p275
aVThis slide here, the black line shows
p276
aVthe measurements that scientists have taken
p277
aVfor the last 150 years
p278
aVshowing that the Earth's temperature
p279
aVhas steadily increased,
p280
aVand you can see in particular that in the last 50 years
p281
aVthere's been this dramatic increase
p282
aVof nearly one degree centigrade,
p283
aVor almost two degrees Fahrenheit.
p284
aa(lp285
VSo what, though, is driving that change?
p286
aVHow can we know what's causing
p287
aVthe observed warming?
p288
aVWell, scientists can model it
p289
aVusing a computer simulation.
p290
aVSo this diagram illustrates a computer simulation
p291
aVthat has looked at all the different factors
p292
aVthat we know can influence the Earth's climate,
p293
aVso sulfate particles from air pollution,
p294
aVvolcanic dust from volcanic eruptions,
p295
aVchanges in solar radiation,
p296
aVand, of course, greenhouse gases.
p297
aVAnd they asked the question,
p298
aVwhat set of variables put into a model
p299
aVwill reproduce what we actually see in real life?
p300
aVSo here is the real life in black.
p301
aVHere's the model in this light gray,
p302
aVand the answer is
p303
aVa model that includes, it's the answer E on that SAT,
p304
aVall of the above.
p305
aVThe only way you can reproduce
p306
aVthe observed temperature measurements
p307
aVis with all of these things put together,
p308
aVincluding greenhouse gases,
p309
aVand in particular you can see that the increase
p310
aVin greenhouse gases tracks
p311
aVthis very dramatic increase in temperature
p312
aVover the last 50 years.
p313
aVAnd so this is why climate scientists say
p314
aVit's not just that we know that climate change is happening,
p315
aVwe know that greenhouse gases are a major part
p316
aVof the reason why.
p317
aa(lp318
VSo now because there all these different things
p319
aVthat scientists do,
p320
aVthe philosopher Paul Feyerabend famously said,
p321
aV"The only principle in science
p322
aVthat doesn't inhibit progress is: anything goes."
p323
aVNow this quotation has often been taken out of context,
p324
aVbecause Feyerabend was not actually saying
p325
aVthat in science anything goes.
p326
aVWhat he was saying was,
p327
aVactually the full quotation is,
p328
aV"If you press me to say
p329
aVwhat is the method of science,
p330
aVI would have to say: anything goes."
p331
aVWhat he was trying to say
p332
aVis that scientists do a lot of different things.
p333
aVScientists are creative.
p334
aa(lp335
VBut then this pushes the question back:
p336
aVIf scientists don't use a single method,
p337
aVthen how do they decide
p338
aVwhat's right and what's wrong?
p339
aVAnd who judges?
p340
aVAnd the answer is, scientists judge,
p341
aVand they judge by judging evidence.
p342
aVScientists collect evidence in many different ways,
p343
aVbut however they collect it,
p344
aVthey have to subject it to scrutiny.
p345
aVAnd this led the sociologist Robert Merton
p346
aVto focus on this question of how scientists
p347
aVscrutinize data and evidence,
p348
aVand he said they do it in a way he called
p349
aV"organized skepticism."
p350
aVAnd by that he meant it's organized
p351
aVbecause they do it collectively,
p352
aVthey do it as a group,
p353
aVand skepticism, because they do it from a position
p354
aVof distrust.
p355
aVThat is to say, the burden of proof
p356
aVis on the person with a novel claim.
p357
aVAnd in this sense, science is intrinsically conservative.
p358
aVIt's quite hard to persuade the scientific community
p359
aVto say, "Yes, we know something, this is true."
p360
aVSo despite the popularity of the concept
p361
aVof paradigm shifts,
p362
aVwhat we find is that actually,
p363
aVreally major changes in scientific thinking
p364
aVare relatively rare in the history of science.
p365
aa(lp366
VSo finally that brings us to one more idea:
p367
aVIf scientists judge evidence collectively,
p368
aVthis has led historians to focus on the question
p369
aVof consensus,
p370
aVand to say that at the end of the day,
p371
aVwhat science is,
p372
aVwhat scientific knowledge is,
p373
aVis the consensus of the scientific experts
p374
aVwho through this process of organized scrutiny,
p375
aVcollective scrutiny,
p376
aVhave judged the evidence
p377
aVand come to a conclusion about it,
p378
aVeither yea or nay.
p379
aa(lp380
VSo we can think of scientific knowledge
p381
aVas a consensus of experts.
p382
aVWe can also think of science as being
p383
aVa kind of a jury,
p384
aVexcept it's a very special kind of jury.
p385
aVIt's not a jury of your peers,
p386
aVit's a jury of geeks.
p387
aVIt's a jury of men and women with Ph.D.s,
p388
aVand unlike a conventional jury,
p389
aVwhich has only two choices,
p390
aVguilty or not guilty,
p391
aVthe scientific jury actually has a number of choices.
p392
aVScientists can say yes, something's true.
p393
aVScientists can say no, it's false.
p394
aVOr, they can say, well it might be true
p395
aVbut we need to work more and collect more evidence.
p396
aVOr, they can say it might be true,
p397
aVbut we don't know how to answer the question
p398
aVand we're going to put it aside
p399
aVand maybe we'll come back to it later.
p400
aVThat's what scientists call "intractable."
p401
aa(lp402
VBut this leads us to one final problem:
p403
aVIf science is what scientists say it is,
p404
aVthen isn't that just an appeal to authority?
p405
aVAnd weren't we all taught in school
p406
aVthat the appeal to authority is a logical fallacy?
p407
aVWell, here's the paradox of modern science,
p408
aVthe paradox of the conclusion I think historians
p409
aVand philosophers and sociologists have come to,
p410
aVthat actually science is the appeal to authority,
p411
aVbut it's not the authority of the individual,
p412
aVno matter how smart that individual is,
p413
aVlike Plato or Socrates or Einstein.
p414
aVIt's the authority of the collective community.
p415
aVYou can think of it is a kind of wisdom of the crowd,
p416
aVbut a very special kind of crowd.
p417
aVScience does appeal to authority,
p418
aVbut it's not based on any individual,
p419
aVno matter how smart that individual may be.
p420
aVIt's based on the collective wisdom,
p421
aVthe collective knowledge, the collective work,
p422
aVof all of the scientists who have worked
p423
aVon a particular problem.
p424
aVScientists have a kind of culture of collective distrust,
p425
aVthis "show me" culture,
p426
aVillustrated by this nice woman here
p427
aVshowing her colleagues her evidence.
p428
aVOf course, these people don't really look like scientists,
p429
aVbecause they're much too happy.
p430
aV(Laughter)
p431
aa(lp432
VOkay, so that brings me to my final point.
p433
aVMost of us get up in the morning.
p434
aVMost of us trust our cars.
p435
aVWell, see, now I'm thinking, I'm in Manhattan,
p436
aVthis is a bad analogy,
p437
aVbut most Americans who don't live in Manhattan
p438
aVget up in the morning and get in their cars
p439
aVand turn on that ignition, and their cars work,
p440
aVand they work incredibly well.
p441
aVThe modern automobile hardly ever breaks down.
p442
aa(lp443
VSo why is that? Why do cars work so well?
p444
aVIt's not because of the genius of Henry Ford
p445
aVor Karl Benz or even Elon Musk.
p446
aVIt's because the modern automobile
p447
aVis the product of more than 100 years of work
p448
aVby hundreds and thousands
p449
aVand tens of thousands of people.
p450
aVThe modern automobile is the product
p451
aVof the collected work and wisdom and experience
p452
aVof every man and woman who has ever worked
p453
aVon a car,
p454
aVand the reliability of the technology is the result
p455
aVof that accumulated effort.
p456
aVWe benefit not just from the genius of Benz
p457
aVand Ford and Musk
p458
aVbut from the collective intelligence and hard work

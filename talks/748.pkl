VCan geographic information
p5
aVmake you healthy?
p6
aVIn 2001 I got hit by a train.
p7
aVMy train was a heart attack.
p8
aVI found myself in a hospital
p9
aVin an intensive-care ward,
p10
aVrecuperating from emergency surgery.
p11
aVAnd I suddenly realized something:
p12
aVthat I was completely in the dark.
p13
aVI started asking my questions, "Well, why me?"
p14
aV"Why now?" "Why here?"
p15
aV"Could my doctor have warned me?"
p16
aa(lp17
VSo, what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you
p18
aVis really talk about what is the formula for life and good health.
p19
aVGenetics, lifestyle and environment.
p20
aVThat's going to sort of contain our risks,
p21
aVand if we manage those risks
p22
aVwe're going to live a good life and a good healthy life.
p23
aVWell, I understand the genetics and lifestyle part.
p24
aVAnd you know why I understand that?
p25
aVBecause my physicians constantly
p26
aVask me questions about this.
p27
aa(lp28
VHave you ever had to fill out those long,
p29
aVlegal-size forms in your doctor's office?
p30
aVI mean, if you're lucky enough you get to do it more than once, right?
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aVDo it over and over again. And they ask you questions
p33
aVabout your lifestyle and your family history,
p34
aVyour medication history, your surgical history,
p35
aVyour allergy history ... did I forget any history?
p36
aa(lp37
VBut this part of the equation I didn't really get,
p38
aVand I don't think my physicians
p39
aVreally get this part of the equation.
p40
aVWhat does that mean, my environment?
p41
aVWell, it can mean a lot of things.
p42
aVThis is my life. These are my life places.
p43
aVWe all have these.
p44
aVWhile I'm talking I'd like you to also be thinking about:
p45
aVHow many places have you lived?
p46
aa(lp47
VJust think about that, you know, wander through
p48
aVyour life thinking about this.
p49
aVAnd you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places.
p50
aVYou spend it at rest and you spend it at work.
p51
aVAnd if you're like me, you're in an airplane a good portion of your time
p52
aVtraveling some place.
p53
aVSo, it's not really simple
p54
aVwhen somebody asks you, "Where do you live, where do you work,
p55
aVand where do you spend all your time?
p56
aVAnd where do you expose yourselves to risks
p57
aVthat maybe perhaps you don't even see?"
p58
aVWell, when I have done this on myself,
p59
aVI always come to the conclusion
p60
aVthat I spend about 75 percent of my time
p61
aVrelatively in a small number of places.
p62
aVAnd I don't wander far from that place
p63
aVfor a majority of my time,
p64
aVeven though I'm an extensive global trekker.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow, I'm going to take you on a little journey here.
p67
aVI started off in Scranton, Pennsylvania.
p68
aVI don't know if anybody might hail from northeastern Pennsylvania,
p69
aVbut this is where I spent my first 19 years
p70
aVwith my little young lungs.
p71
aVYou know, breathing high concentrations here
p72
aVof sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide
p73
aVand methane gas,
p74
aVin unequal quantities \u2014 19 years of this.
p75
aVAnd if you've been in that part of the country,
p76
aVthis is what those piles of burning, smoldering coal waste look like.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo then I decided to leave that part of the world,
p79
aVand I was going to go to the mid-west.
p80
aVOK, so I ended up in Louisville, Kentucky.
p81
aVWell, I decided to be neighbors to a place called Rubbertown.
p82
aVThey manufacture plastics. They use large quantities chloroprene
p83
aVand benzene.
p84
aVOkay, I spent 25 years, in my middle-age lungs now,
p85
aVbreathing various concentrations of that.
p86
aVAnd on a clear day it always looked like this, so you never saw it.
p87
aVIt was insidious and it was really happening.
p88
aa(lp89
VThen I decided I had to get really smart,
p90
aVI would take this job in the West Coast.
p91
aVAnd I moved to Redlands California.
p92
aVVery nice, and there
p93
aVmy older, senior lungs, as I like to call them,
p94
aVI filled with particulate matter, carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone.
p95
aVOkay? Almost like the highest in the nation.
p96
aVAlright, this is what it looks like on a good day.
p97
aVIf you've been there, you know what I'm talking about.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo, what's wrong with this picture?
p100
aVWell, the picture is, there is a huge gap here.
p101
aVThe one thing that never happens in my doctor's office:
p102
aVThey never ask me about my place history.
p103
aVNo doctor, can I remember, ever asking me,
p104
aV"Where have you lived?"
p105
aVThey haven't asked me what kind of the quality
p106
aVof the drinking water that I put in my mouth
p107
aVor the food that I ingest into my stomach.
p108
aVThey really don't do that. It's missing.
p109
aVLook at the kind of data that's available.
p110
aVThis data's from all over the world \u2014
p111
aVcountries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research.
p112
aa(lp113
VNow, I've circled the places where I've been.
p114
aVWell, by design, if I wanted to have a heart attack
p115
aVI'd been in the right places. Right?
p116
aVSo, how many people are in the white?
p117
aVHow many people in the room have spent the majority of their life
p118
aVin the white space?
p119
aVAnybody? Boy you're lucky.
p120
aVHow many have spent it in the red places?
p121
aVOh, not so lucky.
p122
aVThere are thousands of these kinds of maps
p123
aVthat are displayed in atlases
p124
aVall over the world.
p125
aVThey give us some sense of what's going
p126
aVto be our train wreck.
p127
aVBut none of that's in my medical record.
p128
aVAnd it's not in yours either.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo, here's my friend Paul.
p131
aVHe's a colleague. He allowed his cell phone to be tracked
p132
aVevery two hours, 24/7,
p133
aV365 days out of the year
p134
aVfor the last two years, everywhere he went.
p135
aVAnd you can see he's been to a few places around the United States.
p136
aVAnd this is where he has spent most of his time.
p137
aVIf you really studied that you might have some clues
p138
aVas to what Paul likes to do.
p139
aVAnybody got any clues? Ski. Right.
p140
aVWe can zoom in here, and we suddenly see
p141
aVthat now we see where Paul has really spent a majority of his time.
p142
aVAnd all of those black dots are all of the
p143
aVtoxic release inventories
p144
aVthat are monitored by the EPA.
p145
aa(lp146
VDid you know that data existed?
p147
aVFor every community in the United States,
p148
aVyou could have your own personalized map of that.
p149
aVSo, our cell phones can now build a place history.
p150
aVThis is how Paul did it. He did it with his iPhone.
p151
aVThis might be what we end up with.
p152
aa(lp153
VThis is what the physician would have
p154
aVin front of him and her when we enter that exam room
p155
aVinstead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter. Right?
p156
aVThis could be my little assessment.
p157
aVAnd he looks at that and he says,
p158
aV"Whoa Bill,
p159
aVI suggest that maybe you not decide,
p160
aVjust because you're out here in beautiful California,
p161
aVand it's warm every day,
p162
aVthat you get out and run at six o'clock at night.
p163
aVI'd suggest that that's a bad idea Bill,
p164
aVbecause of this report."
p165
aa(lp166
VWhat I'd like to leave you for are two prescriptions.
p167
aVOkay, number one is, we must teach physicians
p168
aVabout the value of geographical information.
p169
aVIt's called geomedicine. There are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now
p170
aVthat are focused on this.
p171
aVAnd they're in the early stages of development.
p172
aVThese programs need to be supported,
p173
aVand we need to teach our future
p174
aVdoctors of the world
p175
aVthe importance of some of the information
p176
aVI've shared here with you today.
p177
aa(lp178
VThe second thing we need to do
p179
aVis while we're spending billions and billions
p180
aVof dollars all over the world
p181
aVbuilding an electronic health record,
p182
aVwe make sure we put a place history
p183
aVinside that medical record.
p184
aVIt not only will be important for the physician;
p185
aVit will be important for the researchers
p186
aVthat now will have huge samples to draw upon.
p187
aVBut it will also be useful for us.
p188
aVI could have made the decision, if I had this information,
p189
aVnot to move to the ozone capital
p190
aVof the United States, couldn't I? I could make that decision.
p191
aVOr I could negotiate with my employer
p192
aVto make that decision
p193
aVin the best interest of myself and my company.
p194
aa(lp195
VWith that, I would like to just say that Jack Lord said
p196
aVthis almost 10 years ago.
p197
aVJust look at that for a minute.
p198
aVThat was what the conclusion
p199
aVof the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare was about,
p200
aVwas saying that we can explain the geographic variations
p201
aVthat occur in disease, in illness, in wellness,
p202
aVand how our healthcare system actually operates.
p203
aVThat was what he was talking about
p204
aVon that quote.
p205
aVAnd I would say he got it right almost a decade ago.
p206
aVSo, I'd very much like to see us begin to
p207
aVreally seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records.
p208
aVSo with that, I'll leave you that
p209
aVin my particular view of view of health:
p210
aVGeography always matters.
p211
aVAnd I believe that geographic information
p212
aVcan make both you and me very healthy. Thank you.

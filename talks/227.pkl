VYou know, I've talked about some of these projects before \u2014
p5
aVabout the human genome and what that might mean,
p6
aVand discovering new sets of genes.
p7
aVWe're actually starting at a new point:
p8
aVwe've been digitizing biology,
p9
aVand now we're trying to go from that digital code
p10
aVinto a new phase of biology
p11
aVwith designing and synthesizing life.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo, we've always been trying to ask big questions.
p14
aV"What is life?" is something that I think many biologists
p15
aVhave been trying to understand
p16
aVat various levels.
p17
aVWe've tried various approaches,
p18
aVparing it down to minimal components.
p19
aVWe've been digitizing it now for almost 20 years;
p20
aVwhen we sequenced the human genome,
p21
aVit was going from the analog world of biology
p22
aVinto the digital world of the computer.
p23
aVNow we're trying to ask, "Can we regenerate life
p24
aVor can we create new life
p25
aVout of this digital universe?"
p26
aa(lp27
VThis is the map of a small organism,
p28
aVMycoplasma genitalium,
p29
aVthat has the smallest genome for a species
p30
aVthat can self-replicate in the laboratory,
p31
aVand we've been trying to just see if
p32
aVwe can come up with an even smaller genome.
p33
aVWe're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes
p34
aVout of the 500 or so that are here.
p35
aVWhen we look at its metabolic map,
p36
aVit's relatively simple
p37
aVcompared to ours \u2014
p38
aVtrust me, this is simple \u2014
p39
aVbut when we look at all the genes
p40
aVthat we can knock out one at a time,
p41
aVit's very unlikely that this would yield
p42
aVa living cell.
p43
aVSo we decided the only way forward
p44
aVwas to actually synthesize this chromosome
p45
aVso we could vary the components
p46
aVto ask some of these most fundamental questions.
p47
aVAnd so we started down the road of:
p48
aVcan we synthesize a chromosome?
p49
aVCan chemistry permit making
p50
aVthese really large molecules
p51
aVwhere we've never been before?
p52
aVAnd if we do, can we boot up a chromosome?
p53
aVA chromosome, by the way, is just a piece of inert chemical material.
p54
aVSo, our pace of digitizing life has been increasing
p55
aVat an exponential pace.
p56
aa(lp57
VOur ability to write the genetic code
p58
aVhas been moving pretty slowly
p59
aVbut has been increasing,
p60
aVand our latest point would put it on, now, an exponential curve.
p61
aVWe started this over 15 years ago.
p62
aVIt took several stages, in fact,
p63
aVstarting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments.
p64
aVBut it turns out synthesizing DNA
p65
aVis very difficult.
p66
aVThere are tens of thousands of machines around the world
p67
aVthat make small pieces of DNA \u2014
p68
aV30 to 50 letters in length \u2014
p69
aVand it's a degenerate process, so the longer you make the piece,
p70
aVthe more errors there are.
p71
aVSo we had to create a new method
p72
aVfor putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors.
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd this was our first attempt, starting with the digital information
p75
aVof the genome of phi X174.
p76
aVIt's a small virus that kills bacteria.
p77
aVWe designed the pieces, went through our error correction
p78
aVand had a DNA molecule
p79
aVof about 5,000 letters.
p80
aVThe exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical
p81
aVand put it in the bacteria,
p82
aVand the bacteria started to read this genetic code,
p83
aVmade the viral particles.
p84
aVThe viral particles then were released from the cells
p85
aVand came back and killed the E. coli.
p86
aVI was talking to the oil industry recently
p87
aVand I said they clearly understood that model.
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VThey laughed more than you guys are. (Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd so, we think this is a situation
p94
aVwhere the software can actually build its own hardware
p95
aVin a biological system.
p96
aVBut we wanted to go much larger:
p97
aVwe wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome \u2014
p98
aVit's over 580,000 letters of genetic code \u2014
p99
aVso we thought we'd build them in cassettes the size of the viruses
p100
aVso we could actually vary the cassettes
p101
aVto understand
p102
aVwhat the actual components of a living cell are.
p103
aVDesign is critical,
p104
aVand if you're starting with digital information in the computer,
p105
aVthat digital information has to be really accurate.
p106
aVWhen we first sequenced this genome in 1995,
p107
aVthe standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs.
p108
aVWe actually found, on resequencing it,
p109
aV30 errors; had we used that original sequence,
p110
aVit never would have been able to be booted up.
p111
aVPart of the design is designing pieces
p112
aVthat are 50 letters long
p113
aVthat have to overlap with all the other 50-letter pieces
p114
aVto build smaller subunits
p115
aVwe have to design so they can go together.
p116
aVWe design unique elements into this.
p117
aa(lp118
VYou may have read that we put watermarks in.
p119
aVThink of this:
p120
aVwe have a four-letter genetic code \u2014 A, C, G and T.
p121
aVTriplets of those letters
p122
aVcode for roughly 20 amino acids,
p123
aVsuch that there's a single letter designation
p124
aVfor each of the amino acids.
p125
aVSo we can use the genetic code to write out words,
p126
aVsentences, thoughts.
p127
aVInitially, all we did was autograph it.
p128
aVSome people were disappointed there was not poetry.
p129
aVWe designed these pieces so
p130
aVwe can just chew back with enzymes;
p131
aVthere are enzymes that repair them and put them together.
p132
aVAnd we started making pieces,
p133
aVstarting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters,
p134
aVput those together to make 24,000-letter pieces,
p135
aVthen put sets of those going up to 72,000.
p136
aa(lp137
VAt each stage, we grew up these pieces in abundance
p138
aVso we could sequence them
p139
aVbecause we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust
p140
aVthat you can see in a minute.
p141
aVWe're trying to get to the point of automation.
p142
aVSo, this looks like a basketball playoff.
p143
aVWhen we get into these really large pieces
p144
aVover 100,000 base pairs,
p145
aVthey won't any longer grow readily in E. coli \u2014
p146
aVit exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology \u2014
p147
aVand so we turned to other mechanisms.
p148
aVWe knew there's a mechanism called homologous recombination
p149
aVthat biology uses to repair DNA
p150
aVthat can put pieces together.
p151
aVHere's an example of it:
p152
aVthere's an organism called
p153
aVDeinococcus radiodurans
p154
aVthat can take three millions rads of radiation.
p155
aa(lp156
VYou can see in the top panel, its chromosome just gets blown apart.
p157
aVTwelve to 24 hours later, it put it
p158
aVback together exactly as it was before.
p159
aVWe have thousands of organisms that can do this.
p160
aVThese organisms can be totally desiccated;
p161
aVthey can live in a vacuum.
p162
aVI am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space,
p163
aVmove around, find a new aqueous environment.
p164
aVIn fact, NASA has shown a lot of this is out there.
p165
aa(lp166
VHere's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built
p167
aVusing these processes, actually just using yeast mechanisms
p168
aVwith the right design of the pieces we put them in;
p169
aVyeast puts them together automatically.
p170
aVThis is not an electron micrograph;
p171
aVthis is just a regular photomicrograph.
p172
aVIt's such a large molecule
p173
aVwe can see it with a light microscope.
p174
aVThese are pictures over about a six-second period.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo, this is the publication we had just a short while ago.
p177
aVThis is over 580,000 letters of genetic code;
p178
aVit's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure.
p179
aVIt's over 300 million molecular weight.
p180
aVIf we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing,
p181
aVit takes 142 pages
p182
aVjust to print this genetic code.
p183
aVWell, how do we boot up a chromosome? How do we activate this?
p184
aVObviously, with a virus it's pretty simple;
p185
aVit's much more complicated dealing with bacteria.
p186
aVIt's also simpler when you go
p187
aVinto eukaryotes like ourselves:
p188
aVyou can just pop out the nucleus
p189
aVand pop in another one,
p190
aVand that's what you've all heard about with cloning.
p191
aVWith bacteria and Archaea, the chromosome is integrated into the cell,
p192
aVbut we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant
p193
aVof a chromosome from one cell to another
p194
aVand activate it.
p195
aVWe purified a chromosome from one microbial species \u2014
p196
aVroughly, these two are as distant as human and mice \u2014
p197
aVwe added a few extra genes
p198
aVso we could select for this chromosome,
p199
aVwe digested it with enzymes
p200
aVto kill all the proteins,
p201
aVand it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell \u2014
p202
aVand you'll appreciate
p203
aVour very sophisticated graphics here.
p204
aVThe new chromosome went into the cell.
p205
aVIn fact, we thought this might be as far as it went,
p206
aVbut we tried to design the process a little bit further.
p207
aa(lp208
VThis is a major mechanism of evolution right here.
p209
aVWe find all kinds of species
p210
aVthat have taken up a second chromosome
p211
aVor a third one from somewhere,
p212
aVadding thousands of new traits
p213
aVin a second to that species.
p214
aVSo, people who think of evolution
p215
aVas just one gene changing at a time
p216
aVhave missed much of biology.
p217
aa(lp218
VThere are enzymes called restriction enzymes
p219
aVthat actually digest DNA.
p220
aVThe chromosome that was in the cell
p221
aVdoesn't have one;
p222
aVthe chromosome we put in does.
p223
aVIt got expressed and it recognized
p224
aVthe other chromosome as foreign material,
p225
aVchewed it up, and so we ended up
p226
aVjust with a cell with the new chromosome.
p227
aVIt turned blue because of the genes we put in it.
p228
aVAnd with a very short period of time,
p229
aVall the characteristics of one species were lost
p230
aVand it converted totally into the new species
p231
aVbased on the new software that we put in the cell.
p232
aVAll the proteins changed,
p233
aVthe membranes changed;
p234
aVwhen we read the genetic code, it's exactly what we had transferred in.
p235
aa(lp236
VSo, this may sound like genomic alchemy,
p237
aVbut we can, by moving the software of DNA around,
p238
aVchange things quite dramatically.
p239
aVNow I've argued, this is not genesis;
p240
aVthis is building on three and a half billion years of evolution.
p241
aVAnd I've argued that we're about to perhaps
p242
aVcreate a new version of the Cambrian explosion,
p243
aVwhere there's massive new speciation
p244
aVbased on this digital design.
p245
aa(lp246
VWhy do this?
p247
aVI think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs.
p248
aVWe're about to go from six and a half
p249
aVto nine billion people over the next 40 years.
p250
aVTo put it in context for myself:
p251
aVI was born in 1946.
p252
aVThere are now three people on the planet
p253
aVfor every one of us that existed in 1946;
p254
aVwithin 40 years, there'll be four.
p255
aVWe have trouble feeding, providing fresh, clean water,
p256
aVmedicines, fuel
p257
aVfor the six and a half billion.
p258
aVIt's going to be a stretch to do it for nine.
p259
aVWe use over five billion tons of coal,
p260
aV30 billion-plus barrels of oil \u2014
p261
aVthat's a hundred million barrels a day.
p262
aVWhen we try to think of biological processes
p263
aVor any process to replace that,
p264
aVit's going to be a huge challenge.
p265
aVThen of course, there's all that
p266
aVCO2 from this material
p267
aVthat ends up in the atmosphere.
p268
aa(lp269
VWe now, from our discovery around the world,
p270
aVhave a database with about 20 million genes,
p271
aVand I like to think of these as the design components of the future.
p272
aVThe electronics industry only had a dozen or so components,
p273
aVand look at the diversity that came out of that.
p274
aVWe're limited here primarily
p275
aVby a biological reality
p276
aVand our imagination.
p277
aVWe now have techniques,
p278
aVbecause of these rapid methods of synthesis,
p279
aVto do what we're calling combinatorial genomics.
p280
aVWe have the ability now to build a large robot
p281
aVthat can make a million chromosomes a day.
p282
aVWhen you think of processing these 20 million different genes
p283
aVor trying to optimize processes
p284
aVto produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals,
p285
aVnew vaccines,
p286
aVwe can just with a small team,
p287
aVdo more molecular biology
p288
aVthan the last 20 years of all science.
p289
aVAnd it's just standard selection:
p290
aVwe can select for viability,
p291
aVchemical or fuel production,
p292
aVvaccine production, etc.
p293
aa(lp294
VThis is a screen snapshot
p295
aVof some true design software
p296
aVthat we're working on to actually be able to sit down
p297
aVand design species in the computer.
p298
aVYou know, we don't know necessarily what it'll look like:
p299
aVwe know exactly what their genetic code looks like.
p300
aVWe're focusing on now fourth-generation fuels.
p301
aVYou've seen recently, corn to ethanol
p302
aVis just a bad experiment.
p303
aVWe have second- and third-generation fuels
p304
aVthat will be coming out relatively soon
p305
aVthat are sugar, to much higher-value fuels
p306
aVlike octane or different types of butanol.
p307
aa(lp308
VBut the only way we think that biology
p309
aVcan have a major impact without
p310
aVfurther increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability
p311
aVis if we start with CO2 as its feedstock,
p312
aVand so we're working with designing cells to go down this road.
p313
aVAnd we think we'll have the first fourth-generation fuels
p314
aVin about 18 months.
p315
aVSunlight and CO2 is one method ...
p316
aV(Applause)
p317
aVbut in our discovery around the world,
p318
aVwe have all kinds of other methods.
p319
aa(lp320
VThis is an organism we described in 1996.
p321
aVIt lives in the deep ocean,
p322
aVabout a mile and a half deep,
p323
aValmost at boiling-water temperatures.
p324
aVIt takes CO2 to methane
p325
aVusing molecular hydrogen as its energy source.
p326
aVWe're looking to see if we can take
p327
aVcaptured CO2,
p328
aVwhich can easily be piped to sites,
p329
aVconvert that CO2 back into fuel
p330
aVto drive this process.
p331
aa(lp332
VSo, in a short period of time,
p333
aVwe think that we might be able to increase
p334
aVwhat the basic question is of "What is life?"
p335
aVWe truly, you know,
p336
aVhave modest goals
p337
aVof replacing the whole petrol-chemical industry \u2014
p338
aa(lp339
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p340
aa(lp341
VYeah. If you can't do that at TED, where can you? \u2014
p342
aa(lp343
V(Laughter)
p344
aa(lp345
Vbecome a major source of energy ...
p346
aVBut also, we're now working on using these same tools
p347
aVto come up with instant sets of vaccines.
p348
aVYou've seen this year with flu;
p349
aVwe're always a year behind and a dollar short
p350
aVwhen it comes to the right vaccine.
p351
aVI think that can be changed
p352
aVby building combinatorial vaccines in advance.
p353
aVHere's what the future may begin to look like
p354
aVwith changing, now, the evolutionary tree,
p355
aVspeeding up evolution
p356
aVwith synthetic bacteria, Archaea
p357
aVand, eventually, eukaryotes.
p358
aVWe're a ways away from improving people:
p359
aVour goal is just to make sure that we have a chance
p360
aVto survive long enough to maybe do that. Thank you very much.

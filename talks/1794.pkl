VI'm going to talk about consciousness.
p5
aVWhy consciousness?
p6
aVWell, it's a curiously neglected subject,
p7
aVboth in our scientific and our philosophical culture.
p8
aVNow why is that curious?
p9
aVWell, it is the most important aspect of our lives
p10
aVfor a very simple, logical reason,
p11
aVnamely, it's a necessary condition on anything
p12
aVbeing important in our lives that we're conscious.
p13
aVYou care about science, philosophy, music, art, whatever \u2014
p14
aVit's no good if you're a zombie or in a coma, right?
p15
aVSo consciousness is number one.
p16
aVThe second reason is that when people do
p17
aVget interested in it, as I think they should,
p18
aVthey tend to say the most appalling things.
p19
aVAnd then, even when they're not saying appalling things
p20
aVand they're really trying to do serious research,
p21
aVwell, it's been slow. Progress has been slow.
p22
aVWhen I first got interested in this, I thought, well,
p23
aVit's a straightforward problem in biology.
p24
aVLet's get these brain stabbers to get busy and figure out
p25
aVhow it works in the brain.
p26
aVSo I went over to UCSF and I talked to all
p27
aVthe heavy-duty neurobiologists there,
p28
aVand they showed some impatience,
p29
aVas scientists often do when you ask them embarrassing questions.
p30
aVBut the thing that struck me is, one guy said in exasperation,
p31
aVa very famous neurobiologist, he said, "Look,
p32
aVin my discipline it's okay to be interested in consciousness,
p33
aVbut get tenure first. Get tenure first."
p34
aVNow I've been working on this for a long time.
p35
aVI think now you might actually get tenure
p36
aVby working on consciousness.
p37
aVIf so, that's a real step forward.
p38
aVOkay, now why then is this curious reluctance
p39
aVand curious hostility to consciousness?
p40
aVWell, I think it's a combination of two features
p41
aVof our intellectual culture
p42
aVthat like to think they're opposing each other
p43
aVbut in fact they share a common set of assumptions.
p44
aVOne feature is the tradition of religious dualism:
p45
aVConsciousness is not a part of the physical world.
p46
aVIt's a part of the spiritual world.
p47
aVIt belongs to the soul,
p48
aVand the soul is not a part of the physical world.
p49
aVThat's the tradition of God, the soul and immortality.
p50
aVThere's another tradition that thinks it's opposed to this
p51
aVbut accepts the worst assumption.
p52
aVThat tradition thinks that we are heavy-duty scientific materialists:
p53
aVConsciousness is not a part of the physical world.
p54
aVEither it doesn't exist at all, or it's something else,
p55
aVa computer program or some damn fool thing,
p56
aVbut in any case it's not part of science.
p57
aVAnd I used to get in an argument that really gave me a stomachache.
p58
aVHere's how it went.
p59
aVScience is objective, consciousness is subjective,
p60
aVtherefore there cannot be a science of consciousness.
p61
aVOkay, so these twin traditions are paralyzing us.
p62
aVIt's very hard to get out of these twin traditions.
p63
aVAnd I have only one real message in this lecture,
p64
aVand that is, consciousness is a biological phenomenon
p65
aVlike photosynthesis, digestion, mitosis \u2014
p66
aVyou know all the biological phenomena \u2014 and once you accept that,
p67
aVmost, though not all, of the hard problems
p68
aVabout consciousness simply evaporate.
p69
aVAnd I'm going to go through some of them.
p70
aVOkay, now I promised you to tell you some
p71
aVof the outrageous things said about consciousness.
p72
aVOne: Consciousness does not exist.
p73
aVIt's an illusion, like sunsets.
p74
aVScience has shown sunsets and rainbows are illusions.
p75
aVSo consciousness is an illusion.
p76
aVTwo: Well, maybe it exists, but it's really something else.
p77
aVIt's a computer program running in the brain.
p78
aVThree: No, the only thing that exists is really behavior.
p79
aVIt's embarrassing how influential behaviorism was,
p80
aVbut I'll get back to that.
p81
aVAnd four: Maybe consciousness exists,
p82
aVbut it can't make any difference to the world.
p83
aVHow could spirituality move anything?
p84
aVNow, whenever somebody tells me that, I think,
p85
aVyou want to see spirituality move something?
p86
aVWatch. I decide consciously to raise my arm,
p87
aVand the damn thing goes up. (Laughter)
p88
aVFurthermore, notice this:
p89
aVWe do not say, "Well, it's a bit like the weather in Geneva.
p90
aVSome days it goes up and some days it doesn't go up."
p91
aVNo. It goes up whenever I damn well want it to.
p92
aVOkay. I'm going to tell you how that's possible.
p93
aVNow, I haven't yet given you a definition.
p94
aVYou can't do this if you don't give a definition.
p95
aVPeople always say consciousness is very hard to define.
p96
aVI think it's rather easy to define
p97
aVif you're not trying to give a scientific definition.
p98
aVWe're not ready for a scientific definition,
p99
aVbut here's a common-sense definition.
p100
aVConsciousness consists of all those states of feeling
p101
aVor sentience or awareness.
p102
aVIt begins in the morning when you wake up from a dreamless sleep,
p103
aVand it goes on all day until you fall asleep
p104
aVor die or otherwise become unconscious.
p105
aVDreams are a form of consciousness on this definition.
p106
aVNow, that's the common-sense definition. That's our target.
p107
aVIf you're not talking about that, you're not talking about consciousness.
p108
aVBut they think, "Well, if that's it, that's an awful problem.
p109
aVHow can such a thing exist as part of the real world?"
p110
aVAnd this, if you've ever had a philosophy course,
p111
aVthis is known as the famous mind-body problem.
p112
aVI think that has a simple solution too. I'm going to give it to you.
p113
aVAnd here it is: All of our conscious states, without exception,
p114
aVare caused by lower-level neurobiological processes in the brain,
p115
aVand they are realized in the brain
p116
aVas higher-level or system features.
p117
aVIt's about as mysterious as the liquidity of water.
p118
aVRight? The liquidity is not an extra juice squirted out
p119
aVby the H2O molecules.
p120
aVIt's a condition that the system is in.
p121
aVAnd just as the jar full of water can go from liquid to solid
p122
aVdepending on the behavior of the molecules,
p123
aVso your brain can go from a state of being conscious
p124
aVto a state of being unconscious,
p125
aVdepending on the behavior of the molecules.
p126
aVThe famous mind-body problem is that simple.
p127
aVAll right? But now we get into some harder questions.
p128
aVLet's specify the exact features of consciousness,
p129
aVso that we can then answer those four objections
p130
aVthat I made to it.
p131
aVWell, the first feature is, it's real and irreducible.
p132
aVYou can't get rid of it.
p133
aVYou see, the distinction between reality and illusion
p134
aVis the distinction between how things
p135
aVconsciously seem to us and how they really are.
p136
aVIt consciously seems like there's \u2014
p137
aVI like the French "arc-en-ciel" \u2014
p138
aVit seems like there's an arch in the sky,
p139
aVor it seems like the sun is setting over the mountains.
p140
aVIt consciously seems to us, but that's not really happening.
p141
aVBut for that distinction between
p142
aVhow things consciously seem and how they really are,
p143
aVyou can't make that distinction for the very existence of consciousness,
p144
aVbecause where the very existence of consciousness is concerned,
p145
aVif it consciously seems to you that you are conscious,
p146
aVyou are conscious.
p147
aVI mean, if a bunch of experts come to me and say,
p148
aV"We are heavy-duty neurobiologists and we've done a study
p149
aVof you, Searle, and we're convinced you are not conscious,
p150
aVyou are a very cleverly constructed robot,"
p151
aVI don't think, "Well, maybe these guys are right, you know?"
p152
aVI don't think that for a moment, because, I mean,
p153
aVDescartes may have made a lot of mistakes, but he was right about this.
p154
aVYou cannot doubt the existence of your own consciousness.
p155
aVOkay, that's the first feature of consciousness.
p156
aVIt's real and irreducible.
p157
aVYou cannot get rid of it by showing that it's an illusion
p158
aVin a way that you can with other standard illusions.
p159
aVOkay, the second feature is this one
p160
aVthat has been such a source of trouble to us,
p161
aVand that is, all of our conscious states
p162
aVhave this qualitative character to them.
p163
aVThere's something that it feels like to drink beer
p164
aVwhich is not what it feels like to do your income tax
p165
aVor listen to music, and this qualitative feel
p166
aVautomatically generates a third feature,
p167
aVnamely, conscious states are by definition subjective
p168
aVin the sense that they only exist as experienced
p169
aVby some human or animal subject,
p170
aVsome self that experiences them.
p171
aVMaybe we'll be able to build a conscious machine.
p172
aVSince we don't know how our brains do it,
p173
aVwe're not in a position, so far, to build a conscious machine.
p174
aVOkay. Another feature of consciousness
p175
aVis that it comes in unified conscious fields.
p176
aVSo I don't just have the sight of the people in front of me
p177
aVand the sound of my voice and the weight of my shoes
p178
aVagainst the floor, but they occur to me
p179
aVas part of one single great conscious field
p180
aVthat stretches forward and backward.
p181
aVThat is the key to understanding
p182
aVthe enormous power of consciousness.
p183
aVAnd we have not been able to do that in a robot.
p184
aVThe disappointment of robotics derives from the fact
p185
aVthat we don't know how to make a conscious robot,
p186
aVso we don't have a machine that can do this kind of thing.
p187
aVOkay, the next feature of consciousness,
p188
aVafter this marvelous unified conscious field,
p189
aVis that it functions causally in our behavior.
p190
aVI gave you a scientific demonstration by raising my hand,
p191
aVbut how is that possible?
p192
aVHow can it be that this thought in my brain
p193
aVcan move material objects?
p194
aVWell, I'll tell you the answer.
p195
aVI mean, we don't know the detailed answer,
p196
aVbut we know the basic part of the answer, and that is,
p197
aVthere is a sequence of neuron firings,
p198
aVand they terminate where the acetylcholine
p199
aVis secreted at the axon end-plates of the motor neurons.
p200
aVSorry to use philosophical terminology here,
p201
aVbut when it's secreted at the axon end-plates of the motor neurons,
p202
aVa whole lot of wonderful things happen in the ion channels
p203
aVand the damned arm goes up.
p204
aVNow, think of what I told you.
p205
aVOne and the same event,
p206
aVmy conscious decision to raise my arm
p207
aVhas a level of description where it has all of these
p208
aVtouchy-feely spiritual qualities.
p209
aVIt's a thought in my brain, but at the same time,
p210
aVit's busy secreting acetylcholine
p211
aVand doing all sorts of other things
p212
aVas it makes its way from the motor cortex
p213
aVdown through the nerve fibers in the arm.
p214
aVNow, what that tells us is that our traditional vocabularies
p215
aVfor discussing these issues are totally obsolete.
p216
aVOne and the same event has a level of description
p217
aVwhere it's neurobiological, and another level of description
p218
aVwhere it's mental, and that's a single event,
p219
aVand that's how nature works. That's how it's possible
p220
aVfor consciousness to function causally.
p221
aVOkay, now with that in mind,
p222
aVwith going through these various features of consciousness,
p223
aVlet's go back and answer some of those early objections.
p224
aVWell, the first one I said was, consciousness doesn't exist,
p225
aVit's an illusion. Well, I've already answered that.
p226
aVI don't think we need to worry about that.
p227
aVBut the second one had an incredible influence,
p228
aVand may still be around, and that is,
p229
aV"Well, if consciousness exists, it's really something else.
p230
aVIt's really a digital computer program running in your brain
p231
aVand that's what we need to do to create consciousness
p232
aVis get the right program.
p233
aVYeah, forget about the hardware. Any hardware will do
p234
aVprovided it's rich enough and stable enough to carry the program."
p235
aVNow, we know that that's wrong.
p236
aVI mean, anybody who's thought about computers at all
p237
aVcan see that that's wrong, because computation
p238
aVis defined as symbol manipulation,
p239
aVusually thought of as zeros as ones, but any symbols will do.
p240
aVYou get an algorithm that you can program
p241
aVin a binary code, and that's the defining trait
p242
aVof the computer program.
p243
aVBut we know that that's purely syntactical. That's symbolic.
p244
aVWe know that actual human consciousness has something more than that.
p245
aVIt's got a content in addition to the syntax.
p246
aVIt's got a semantics.
p247
aVNow that argument, I made that argument 30 \u2014
p248
aVoh my God, I don't want to think about it \u2014
p249
aVmore than 30 years ago,
p250
aVbut there's a deeper argument implicit in what I've told you,
p251
aVand I want to tell you that argument briefly, and that is,
p252
aVconsciousness creates an observer-independent reality.
p253
aVIt creates a reality of money, property, government,
p254
aVmarriage, CERN conferences,
p255
aVcocktail parties and summer vacations,
p256
aVand all of those are creations of consciousness.
p257
aVTheir existence is observer-relative.
p258
aVIt's only relative to conscious agents that a piece of paper
p259
aVis money or that a bunch of buildings is a university.
p260
aVNow, ask yourself about computation.
p261
aVIs that absolute, like force and mass and gravitational attraction?
p262
aVOr is it observer-relative?
p263
aVWell, some computations are intrinsic.
p264
aVI add two plus two to get four.
p265
aVThat's going on no matter what anybody thinks.
p266
aVBut when I haul out my pocket calculator
p267
aVand do the calculation, the only intrinsic phenomenon
p268
aVis the electronic circuit and its behavior.
p269
aVThat's the only absolute phenomenon.
p270
aVAll the rest is interpreted by us.
p271
aVComputation only exists relative to consciousness.
p272
aVEither a conscious agent is carrying out the computation,
p273
aVor he's got a piece of machinery that admits of a computational interpretation.
p274
aVNow that doesn't mean computation is arbitrary.
p275
aVI spent a lot of money on this hardware.
p276
aVBut we have this persistent confusion
p277
aVbetween objectivity and subjectivity as features of reality
p278
aVand objectivity and subjectivity as features of claims.
p279
aVAnd the bottom line of this part of my talk is this:
p280
aVYou can have a completely objective science,
p281
aVa science where you make objectively true claims,
p282
aVabout a domain whose existence is subjective,
p283
aVwhose existence is in the human brain
p284
aVconsisting of subjective states of sentience
p285
aVor feeling or awareness.
p286
aVSo the objection that you can't have an objective science of consciousness
p287
aVbecause it's subjective and science is objective, that's a pun.
p288
aVThat's a bad pun on objectivity and subjectivity.
p289
aVYou can make objective claims
p290
aVabout a domain that is subjective in its mode of existence,
p291
aVand indeed that's what neurologists do.
p292
aVI mean, you have patients that actually suffer pains,
p293
aVand you try to get an objective science of that.
p294
aVOkay, I promised to refute all these guys,
p295
aVand I don't have an awful lot of time left,
p296
aVbut let me refute a couple more of them.
p297
aVI said that behaviorism ought to be
p298
aVone of the great embarrassments of our intellectual culture,
p299
aVbecause it's refuted the moment you think about it.
p300
aVYour mental states are identical with your behavior?
p301
aVWell, think about the distinction between feeling a pain
p302
aVand engaging in pain behavior.
p303
aVI won't demonstrate pain behavior, but I can tell you
p304
aVI'm not having any pains right now.
p305
aVSo it's an obvious mistake. Why did they make the mistake?
p306
aVThe mistake was \u2014 and you can go back and read
p307
aVthe literature on this, you can see this over and over \u2014
p308
aVthey think if you accept the irreducible existence
p309
aVof consciousness, you're giving up on science.
p310
aVYou're giving up on 300 years of human progress
p311
aVand human hope and all the rest of it.
p312
aVAnd the message I want to leave you with is,
p313
aVconsciousness has to become accepted
p314
aVas a genuine biological phenomenon,
p315
aVas much subject to scientific analysis
p316
aVas any other phenomenon in biology,
p317
aVor, for that matter, the rest of science.
p318
aVThank you very much.

In it, he imagines a room containing an individual, who speaks only English, working with a set of English instructions to write a series of Chinese characters in order to anonymous communicate with a Chinese speaker outside the room. If that individual follows the instructions carefully, she can effectively fool the Chinese speaker into thinking he&rsquo;s talking to someone who understands his language. Serle argues that, at the very least, the metaphor raises deep complications as to whether or not one can truly describe convincing simulations of intelligence as intelligent.<br /><br />He remains of firm believer that subjective experiences are real -- even if they don&rsquo;t always describe things are they really are -- and are worth thinking about in objective terms because of it.</p>", "slug": "john_searle", "whotheyare": "John Searle has made countless contributions to contemporary thinking about consciousness, language, artificial intelligence and rationality itself.", "whatotherssay": "", "id": 1665, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/1f1c798a01ae96343a6fff4a09e29b9929efed7b_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "Our shared condition -- consciousness", "take_action": null, "comments": 21389, "more_resources": null, "hero": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/8d1b161c99ec62e5df384353f74efb3419f268f1_2880x1620.jpg", "description": "Philosopher John Searle lays out the case for studying human consciousness -- and systematically shoots down some of the common objections to taking it seriously.

VI'm an American, which means, generally,
p5
aVI ignore football unless it involves
p6
aVguys my size or Bruno's size
p7
aVrunning into each other at extremely high speeds.
p8
aVThat said, it's been really hard
p9
aVto ignore football
p10
aVfor the last couple of weeks.
p11
aVI go onto Twitter, there are all these strange words that I've never heard before:
p12
aVFIFA, vuvuzela,
p13
aVweird jokes about octopi.
p14
aVBut the one that's really been sort of stressing me out,
p15
aVthat I haven't been able to figure out,
p16
aVis this phrase "Cala a boca, Galvao."
p17
aVIf you've gone onto Twitter in the last couple of weeks,
p18
aVyou've probably seen this.
p19
aVIt's been a major trending topic.
p20
aa(lp21
VBeing a monolingual American, I obviously don't know what the phrase means.
p22
aVSo I went onto Twitter,
p23
aVand I asked some people if they could explain to me "Cala a boca, Galvao."
p24
aVAnd fortunately, my Brazilian friends
p25
aVwere more than ready to help.
p26
aVThey explained that the Galvao bird
p27
aVis a rare and endangered parrot
p28
aVthat's in terrible, terrible danger.
p29
aVIn fact, I'll let them tell you a bit more about it.
p30
aVNarrator: A word about Galvao, a very rare kind of bird
p31
aVnative to Brazil.
p32
aVEvery year, more than 300,000 Galvao birds
p33
aVare killed during Carnival parades.
p34
aVEthan Zuckerman: Obviously, this is a tragic situation,
p35
aVand it actually gets worse.
p36
aVIt turns out that, not only is the Galvao parrot
p37
aVvery attractive, useful for headdresses,
p38
aVit evidently has certain hallucinogenic properties,
p39
aVwhich means that there's a terrible problem
p40
aVwith Galvao abuse.
p41
aVSome sick and twisted people have found themselves snorting Galvao.
p42
aVAnd it's terribly endangered.
p43
aVThe good news about this is that the global community \u2014
p44
aVagain, my Brazilian friends tell me \u2014
p45
aVis pitching in to help out.
p46
aVIt turns out that Lady Gaga
p47
aVhas released a new single \u2014
p48
aVactually five or six new singles, as near as I can tell \u2014
p49
aVtitled "Cala a boca, Galvao."
p50
aVAnd my Brazilian friends tell me that
p51
aVif I just tweet the phrase "Cala a boca, Galvao,"
p52
aV10 cents will be given
p53
aVto a global campaign
p54
aVto save this rare and beautiful bird.
p55
aa(lp56
VNow, most of you have figured out that this was a prank,
p57
aVand actually a very, very good one.
p58
aV"Cala a boca, Galvao" actually means something very different.
p59
aVIn Portugese, it means "Shut your mouth, Galvao."
p60
aVAnd it specifically refers to this guy, Galvao Bueno,
p61
aVwho's the lead soccer commentator
p62
aVfor Rede Globo.
p63
aVAnd what I understand from my Brazilian friends
p64
aVis that this guy is just a cliche machine.
p65
aVHe can ruin the most interesting match
p66
aVby just spouting cliche again and again and again.
p67
aVSo Brazilians went to that first match
p68
aVagainst North Korea,
p69
aVput up this banner, started a Twitter campaign
p70
aVand tried to convince the rest of us
p71
aVto tweet the phrase: "Cala a boca, Galvao."
p72
aVAnd in fact, were so successful at this
p73
aVthat it topped Twitter for two weeks.
p74
aa(lp75
VNow there's a couple \u2014
p76
aVthere's a couple of lessons that you can take from this.
p77
aVAnd the first lesson, which I think is a worthwhile one,
p78
aVis that you cannot go wrong
p79
aVasking people to be active online,
p80
aVso long as activism just means retweeting a phrase.
p81
aVSo as long as activism is that simple,
p82
aVit's pretty easy to get away with.
p83
aVThe other thing you can take from this, by the way,
p84
aVis that there are a lot of Brazilians on Twitter.
p85
aVThere's more than five million of them.
p86
aVAs far as national representation,
p87
aV11 percent of Brazilian internet users are on Twitter.
p88
aVThat's a much higher number than in the U.S. or U.K.
p89
aVNext to Japan,
p90
aVit's the second most represented by population.
p91
aa(lp92
VNow if you're using Twitter or other social networks,
p93
aVand you didn't realize
p94
aVthis was a space with a lot of Brazilians in it,
p95
aVyou're like most of us.
p96
aVBecause what happens on a social network
p97
aVis you interact with the people
p98
aVthat you have chosen to interact with.
p99
aVAnd if you are like me, a big, geeky, white, American guy,
p100
aVyou tend to interact with a lot of other geeky, white, American guys.
p101
aVAnd you don't necessarily have the sense
p102
aVthat Twitter is in fact a very heavily Brazilian space.
p103
aVIt's also extremely surprising to many Americans,
p104
aVa heavily African-American space.
p105
aVTwitter recently did some research.
p106
aVThey looked at their local population.
p107
aVThey believe that 24 percent
p108
aVof American Twitter users are African-American.
p109
aVThat's about twice as high as African-Americans
p110
aVare represented in the population.
p111
aVAnd again, that was very shocking to many Twitter users,
p112
aVbut it shouldn't be.
p113
aVAnd the reason it shouldn't be is that on any day
p114
aVyou can go into Trending Topics.
p115
aVAnd you tend to find topics
p116
aVthat are almost entirely African-American conversations.
p117
aa(lp118
VThis was a visualization done by Fernando Viegas
p119
aVand Martin Wattenberg,
p120
aVtwo amazing visualization designers,
p121
aVwho looked at
p122
aVa weekend's worth of Twitter traffic
p123
aVand essentially found that a lot of these trending topics
p124
aVwere basically segregated conversations \u2014
p125
aVand in ways that you wouldn't expect.
p126
aVIt turns out that oil spill is a mostly white conversation,
p127
aVthat cookout
p128
aVis a mostly black conversation.
p129
aVAnd what's crazy about this is that
p130
aVif you wanted to mix up who you were seeing on Twitter,
p131
aVit's literally a quick click away.
p132
aVYou click on that cookout tag, there an entirely different conversation
p133
aVwith different people participating in it.
p134
aVBut generally speaking, most of us don't.
p135
aVWe end up within these filter bubbles, as my friend Eli Pariser calls them,
p136
aVwhere we see the people we already know
p137
aVand the people who are similar to the people we already know.
p138
aVAnd we tend not to see that wider picture.
p139
aa(lp140
VNow for me, I'm surprised by this,
p141
aVbecause this wasn't how the internet was supposed to be.
p142
aVIf you go back into the early days of the internet,
p143
aVwhen cyber-utopians like Nick Negroponte
p144
aVwere writing big books like "Being Digital,"
p145
aVthe prediction was that the internet
p146
aVwas going to be an incredibly powerful force
p147
aVto smooth out cultural differences,
p148
aVto put us all on a common field of one fashion or another.
p149
aVNegroponte started his book with a story
p150
aVabout how hard it is to build connections
p151
aVin the world of atoms.
p152
aVHe's at a technology conference in Florida.
p153
aVAnd he's looking at something really, truly absurd,
p154
aVwhich is bottles of Evian water on the table.
p155
aVAnd Negroponte says this is crazy.
p156
aVThis is the old economy.
p157
aVIt's the economy of moving these
p158
aVheavy, slow atoms over long distances that's very difficult to do.
p159
aVWe're heading to the future of bits,
p160
aVwhere everything is speedy, it's weightless.
p161
aVIt can be anywhere in the world at any time.
p162
aVAnd it's going to change the world as we know it.
p163
aa(lp164
VNow, Negroponte has been right about a lot of things.
p165
aVHe's totally wrong about this one.
p166
aVIt turns out that in many cases
p167
aVatoms are much more mobile than bits.
p168
aVIf I walk into a store in the United States,
p169
aVit's very, very easy for me to buy water
p170
aVthat's bottled in Fiji,
p171
aVshipped at great expense to the United States.
p172
aVIt's actually surprisingly hard
p173
aVfor me to see a Fijian feature film.
p174
aVIt's really difficult for me to listen to Fijian music.
p175
aVIt's extremely difficult for me to get Fijian news,
p176
aVwhich is strange, because actually there's an enormous amount going on in Fiji.
p177
aVThere's a coup government. There's a military government.
p178
aVThere's crackdowns on the press.
p179
aVIt's actually a place that we probably should
p180
aVbe paying attention to at the moment.
p181
aa(lp182
VHere's what I think is going on.
p183
aVI think that we tend to look a lot
p184
aVat the infrastructure
p185
aVof globalization.
p186
aVWe look at the framework that makes it possible
p187
aVto live in this connected world.
p188
aVAnd that's a framework that includes things like airline routes.
p189
aVIt includes things like the Internet cables.
p190
aVWe look at a map like this one,
p191
aVand it looks like the entire world is flat
p192
aVbecause everything is a hop or two away.
p193
aVYou can get on a flight in London,
p194
aVyou can end up in Bangalore later today.
p195
aVTwo hops, you're in Suva, the capitol of Fiji.
p196
aVIt's all right there.
p197
aa(lp198
VWhen you start looking at what actually
p199
aVflows on top of these networks,
p200
aVyou get a very different picture.
p201
aVYou start looking at how
p202
aVthe global plane flights move,
p203
aVand you suddenly discover that the world isn't even close to flat.
p204
aVIt's extremely lumpy.
p205
aVThere are parts of the world that are very, very well connected.
p206
aVThere's basically a giant pathway in the sky
p207
aVbetween London and New York.
p208
aVbut look at this map, and you can watch this
p209
aVfor, you know, two or three minutes.
p210
aVYou won't see very many planes
p211
aVgo from South America to Africa.
p212
aVAnd you'll discover that there are parts of the globe
p213
aVthat are systematically cut off.
p214
aVWhen we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible,
p215
aVand we look at what actually happens,
p216
aVwe start realizing that the world doesn't work quite the same way
p217
aVthat we think it does.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo here's the problem that I've been interested in
p220
aVin the last decade or so.
p221
aVThe world is, in fact, getting more global.
p222
aVIt's getting more connected.
p223
aVMore of problems are global in scale.
p224
aVMore of our economics is global in scale.
p225
aVAnd our media is less global by the day.
p226
aVIf you watched a television broadcast in the United States in the 1970s,
p227
aV35 to 40 percent of it would have been international news
p228
aVon a nightly new broadcast.
p229
aVThat's down to about 12 to 15 percent.
p230
aVAnd this tends to give us a very distorted view of the world.
p231
aVHere's a slide that Alisa Miller showed at a previous TED Talk.
p232
aVAlisa's the president of Public Radio International.
p233
aVAnd she made a cartogram, which is basically a distorted map
p234
aVbased on what American
p235
aVtelevision news casts
p236
aVlooked at for a month.
p237
aVAnd you see that when you distort a map based on attention,
p238
aVthe world within American television news
p239
aVis basically reduced to
p240
aVthis giant bloated U.S.
p241
aVand a couple of other countries which we've invaded.
p242
aVAnd that's basically what our media is about.
p243
aVAnd before you conclude that this is just a function of American TV news \u2014
p244
aVwhich is dreadful, and I agree that it's dreadful \u2014
p245
aVI've been mapping elite media like the New York Times,
p246
aVand I get the same thing.
p247
aVWhen you look at the New York Times, you look at other elite media,
p248
aVwhat you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations
p249
aVand the nations we've invaded.
p250
aa(lp251
VIt turns out that new media
p252
aVisn't necessarily helping us all that much.
p253
aVHere's a map made by Mark Graham
p254
aVwho's down the street at the Oxford Internet Institute.
p255
aVA this is a map of articles in Wikipedia
p256
aVthat have been geo-coded.
p257
aVAnd you'll notice that there's a very heavy bias
p258
aVtowards North America and Western Europe.
p259
aVEven within Wikipedias,
p260
aVwhere we're creating their own content online,
p261
aVthere's a heavy bias towards the place where
p262
aVa lot of the Wikipedia authors are based,
p263
aVrather than to the rest of the world.
p264
aVIn the U.K., you can get up,
p265
aVyou can pick up your computer when you get out of this session,
p266
aVyou could read a newspaper from India or from Australia,
p267
aVfrom Canada, God forbid from the U.S.
p268
aVYou probably won't.
p269
aVIf you look at online media consumption \u2014
p270
aVin this case, in the top 10 users of the internet \u2014
p271
aVmore than 95 percent of the news readership
p272
aVis on domestic news sites.
p273
aVIt's one of these rare cases where the U.S. is actually slightly better than [the U.K.],
p274
aVbecause we actually like reading your media,
p275
aVrather than vice versa.
p276
aa(lp277
VSo all of this starts leading me
p278
aVto think that we're in a state that I refer to
p279
aVas imaginary cosmopolitanism.
p280
aVWe look at the internet.
p281
aVWe think we're getting this wide view of the globe.
p282
aVWe occasionally stumble onto a page in Chinese,
p283
aVand we decide that we do in fact have the greatest technology ever built
p284
aVto connect us to the rest of the world.
p285
aVAnd we forget that most of the time
p286
aVwe're checking Boston Red Sox scores.
p287
aVSo this is a real problem \u2014
p288
aVnot just because the Red Sox are having a bad year \u2014
p289
aVbut it's a real problem because,
p290
aVas we're discussing here at TED,
p291
aVthe real problems in the world
p292
aVthe interesting problems to solve
p293
aVare global in scale and scope,
p294
aVthey require global conversations
p295
aVto get to global solutions.
p296
aVThis is a problem we have to solve.
p297
aa(lp298
VSo here's the good news.
p299
aVFor six years, I've been hanging out with these guys.
p300
aVThis is a group called Global Voices.
p301
aVThis is a team of bloggers from around the world.
p302
aVOur mission was to fix the world's media.
p303
aVWe started in 2004.
p304
aVYou might have noticed, we haven't done all that well so far.
p305
aVNor do I think we are by ourselves,
p306
aVactually going to solve the problem.
p307
aVBut the more that I think about it, the more that I think
p308
aVthat a few things that we have learned along the way
p309
aVare interesting lessons for how we would rewire
p310
aVif we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world.
p311
aVThe first thing you have to consider
p312
aVis that there are parts of the world
p313
aVthat are dark spots in terms of attention.
p314
aVIn this case \u2014 the map of the world at night by NASA \u2014
p315
aVthey're dark literally because of lack of electricity.
p316
aVAnd I used to think that a dark spot on this map
p317
aVbasically meant you're not going to get media from there
p318
aVbecause there are more basic needs.
p319
aa(lp320
VWhat I'm starting to realize is that
p321
aVyou can get media, it's just an enormous amount of work,
p322
aVand you need an enormous amount of encouragement.
p323
aVOne of those dark spots is Madagascar,
p324
aVa country which is generally better known for the Dreamworks film
p325
aVthan it is actually known for
p326
aVthe lovely people who live there.
p327
aVAnd so the people who founded
p328
aVFoko Club in Madagascar
p329
aVweren't actually concerned with trying to change the image of their country.
p330
aVThey were doing something much simpler.
p331
aVIt was a club to learn English
p332
aVand to learn computers and the internet.
p333
aVbut what happened was that Madagascar
p334
aVwent through a violent coup.
p335
aVMost independent media was shut down.
p336
aVAnd the high school students
p337
aVwho were learning to blog through Foko Club
p338
aVsuddenly found themselves talking to an international audience
p339
aVabout the demonstrations, the violence,
p340
aVeverything that was going on within this country.
p341
aVSo a very, very small program
p342
aVdesigned to get people in front of computers,
p343
aVpublishing their own thoughts, publishing independent media,
p344
aVended up having a huge impact
p345
aVon what we know about this country.
p346
aa(lp347
VNow the trick with this is that I'm guessing
p348
aVmost people here don't speak Malagasy.
p349
aVI'm also guessing that most of you don't even speak Chinese \u2014
p350
aVwhich is sort of sad if you think about it,
p351
aVas it's now the most represented language on the internet.
p352
aVFortunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this.
p353
aVIf you're using Google Chrome and you go to a Chinese language site,
p354
aVyou notice this really cute box at the top,
p355
aVwhich automatically detects that the page is in Chinese
p356
aVand very quickly at a mouse click
p357
aVwill give you a translation of the page.
p358
aVUnfortunately, it's a machine translation of the page.
p359
aVAnd while Google is very, very good with some languages,
p360
aVit's actually pretty dreadful with Chinese.
p361
aVAnd the results can be pretty funny.
p362
aVWhat you really want \u2014 what I really want,
p363
aVis eventually the ability to push a button
p364
aVand have this queued
p365
aVso a human being can translate this.
p366
aa(lp367
VAnd if you think this is absurd, it's not.
p368
aVThere's a group right now in China called Yeeyan.
p369
aVAnd Yeeyan is a group
p370
aVof 150,000 volunteers
p371
aVwho get online every day.
p372
aVThey look for the most interesting content in the English language.
p373
aVThey translate roughly 100 articles a day
p374
aVfrom major newspapers, major websites.
p375
aVThey put it online for free.
p376
aVIt's the project of a guy named Zhang Lei,
p377
aVwho was living in the United States during the Lhasa riots
p378
aVand who couldn't believe how biased
p379
aVAmerican media coverage was.
p380
aVAnd he said, "If there's one thing I can do, I can start translating,
p381
aVso that people between these countries
p382
aVstart understanding each other a little bit better."
p383
aVAnd my question to you is:
p384
aVif Yeeyan can line up 150,000 people
p385
aVto translate the English internet into Chinese,
p386
aVwhere's the English language Yeeyan?
p387
aVWho's going after Chinese,
p388
aVwhich now has 400 million internet users out there?
p389
aVMy guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say.
p390
aa(lp391
VSo even if we can find a way to translate from Chinese,
p392
aVthere's no guarantee that we're going to find it.
p393
aVWhen we look for information online,
p394
aVwe basically have two strategies.
p395
aVWe use a lot of search.
p396
aVAnd search is terrific if you know what you're looking for.
p397
aVBut if what you're looking for is serendipity,
p398
aVif you want to stumble onto something
p399
aVthat you didn't know you needed,
p400
aVour main philosophy is to look to our social networks,
p401
aVto look for our friends.
p402
aVWhat are they looking at? Maybe we should be looking at it.
p403
aVThe problem with this is that essentially
p404
aVwhat you end up getting after a while is the wisdom of the flock.
p405
aVYou end up flocking with a lot of people
p406
aVwho are probably similar to you,
p407
aVwho have similar interests.
p408
aVAnd it's very, very hard to get information
p409
aVfrom the other flocks, from the other parts of the world
p410
aVwhere people getting together and talking about their own interests.
p411
aVTo do this, at a certain point,
p412
aVyou need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock.
p413
aVYou need a guide.
p414
aa(lp415
VSo this is Amira Al Hussaini. She is the Middle East editor for Global Voices.
p416
aVShe has one of the hardest jobs in the world.
p417
aVNot only does she have to keep our Israeli and Palestinian contributors
p418
aVfrom killing each other,
p419
aVshe has to figure out
p420
aVwhat is going to interest you
p421
aVabout the Middle East.
p422
aVAnd in that sense of trying to get you
p423
aVout of your normal orbit,
p424
aVand to try to get you to pay attention
p425
aVto a story about someone who's
p426
aVgiven up smoking for the month of Ramadan,
p427
aVshe has to know something about a global audience.
p428
aVShe has to know something about what stories are available.
p429
aVBasically, she's a deejay.
p430
aVShe's a skilled human curator
p431
aVwho knows what material is available to her,
p432
aVwho's able to listen to the audience,
p433
aVand who's able to make a selection
p434
aVand push people forward in one fashion or another.
p435
aVI don't think this is necessarily an algorithmic process.
p436
aVI think what's great about the internet
p437
aVis that it actually makes it much easier
p438
aVfor deejays to reach a wider audience.
p439
aVI know Amira.
p440
aVI can ask her what to read.
p441
aVBut with the internet, she's in a position where she can
p442
aVtell a lot of people what to read.
p443
aVAnd you can listen to her as well,
p444
aVif this is a way that you're interested in having your web widened.
p445
aa(lp446
VSo once you start widening like this,
p447
aVonce you start lighting up voices in the dark spots,
p448
aVonce you start translating, once you start curating,
p449
aVyou end up in some really weird places.
p450
aVThis is an image from pretty much my favorite blog,
p451
aVwhich is AfriGadget.
p452
aVAnd AfriGadget is a blog that looks
p453
aVat technology in an Africa context.
p454
aVAnd specifically, it's looking at a blacksmith
p455
aVin Kibera in Nairobi,
p456
aVwho is turning the shaft of a Landrover
p457
aVinto a cold chisel.
p458
aVAnd when you look at this image, you might find yourself going,
p459
aV"Why would I conceivably care about this?"
p460
aVAnd the truth is, this guy can probably explain this to you.
p461
aVThis is Erik Hersman. You guys may have seen him around the conference.
p462
aVHe goes by the moniker White African.
p463
aVHe's both a very well known American geek,
p464
aVbut he's also Kenyan; he was born in Sudan, grew up in Kenya.
p465
aVHe is a bridge figure.
p466
aVHe is someone who literally has feet in both worlds \u2014
p467
aVone in the world of the African technology community,
p468
aVone in the world of the American technology community.
p469
aVAnd so he's able to tell a story
p470
aVabout this blacksmith in Kibera
p471
aVand turn it into a story about repurposing technology,
p472
aVabout innovating from constraint,
p473
aVabout looking for inspiration based on reusing materials.
p474
aVHe knows one world,
p475
aVand he's finding a way to communicate it to another world,
p476
aVboth of which he has deep connections to.
p477
aVThese bridge figures, I'm pretty well convinced,
p478
aVare the future of how we try to make the world wider
p479
aVthrough using the web.
p480
aa(lp481
VBut the trick with bridges is, ultimately,
p482
aVyou need someone to cross them.
p483
aVAnd that's where we start talking about xenophiles.
p484
aVSo if I found myself in the NFL,
p485
aVI suspect I would spend my off-season
p486
aVnursing my wounds, enjoying my house, so on and so forth \u2014
p487
aVpossibly recording a hip-hop album.
p488
aVDhani Jones,
p489
aVwho is the middle linebacker for the Cincinnati Bengals,
p490
aVhas a slightly different approach to the off-season.
p491
aVDhani has a television show.
p492
aVIt's called "Dhani Tackles the Globe."
p493
aVAnd every week on this television show,
p494
aVDhani travels to a different nation of the world.
p495
aVHe finds a local sporting team.
p496
aVHe trains with them for a week, and he plays a match with them.
p497
aVAnd his reason for this
p498
aVis not just that he wants to master Muay Thai boxing.
p499
aVIt's because, for him,
p500
aVsport is the language
p501
aVthat allows him to encounter
p502
aVthe full width and wonder of the world.
p503
aVFor some of us it might be music. For some of us it might be food.
p504
aVFor a lot of us it might be literature or writing.
p505
aVBut there are all these different techniques
p506
aVthat allow you to go out and look at the world
p507
aVand find your place within it.
p508
aa(lp509
VThe goal of my Talk here
p510
aVis not to persuade the people in this room
p511
aVto embrace your xenophilia.
p512
aVMy guess \u2014 given that you're at a conference called TEDGlobal \u2014
p513
aVis that most of you are xenophiles,
p514
aVwhether or not you use that term.
p515
aVMy challenge instead is this.
p516
aVIt's not enough to make the personal decision
p517
aVthat you want a wider world.
p518
aVWe have to figure out how to rewire
p519
aVthe systems that we have.
p520
aVWe have to fix our media.
p521
aVWe have to fix the internet. We have to fix our education.
p522
aVWe have to fix our immigration policy.
p523
aVWe need to look at ways
p524
aVof creating serendipity,
p525
aVof making translation pervasive,
p526
aVand we need to find ways to embrace
p527
aVand celebrate these bridge figures.
p528
aVAnd we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles.
p529
aVThat's what I'm trying to do. I need your help.

VI'm thrilled to be here tonight
p5
aVto share with you something we've been working on
p6
aVfor over two years,
p7
aVand it's in the area of additive manufacturing,
p8
aValso known as 3D printing.
p9
aa(lp10
VYou see this object here.
p11
aVIt looks fairly simple, but it's quite complex at the same time.
p12
aVIt's a set of concentric geodesic structures
p13
aVwith linkages between each one.
p14
aVIn its context, it is not manufacturable by traditional manufacturing techniques.
p15
aVIt has a symmetry such that you can't injection mold it.
p16
aVYou can't even manufacture it through milling.
p17
aVThis is a job for a 3D printer,
p18
aVbut most 3D printers would take between three and 10 hours to fabricate it,
p19
aVand we're going to take the risk tonight to try to fabricate it onstage
p20
aVduring this 10-minute talk.
p21
aVWish us luck.
p22
aa(lp23
VNow, 3D printing is actually a misnomer.
p24
aVIt's actually 2D printing over and over again,
p25
aVand it in fact uses the technologies associated with 2D printing.
p26
aVThink about inkjet printing where you lay down ink on a page to make letters,
p27
aVand then do that over and over again to build up a three-dimensional object.
p28
aVIn microelectronics, they use something
p29
aVcalled lithography to do the same sort of thing,
p30
aVto make the transistors and integrated circuits
p31
aVand build up a structure several times.
p32
aVThese are all 2D printing technologies.
p33
aa(lp34
VNow, I'm a chemist, a material scientist too,
p35
aVand my co-inventors are also material scientists,
p36
aVone a chemist, one a physicist,
p37
aVand we began to be interested in 3D printing.
p38
aVAnd very often, as you know, new ideas are often simple connections
p39
aVbetween people with different experiences in different communities,
p40
aVand that's our story.
p41
aa(lp42
VNow, we were inspired
p43
aVby the "Terminator 2" scene for T-1000,
p44
aVand we thought, why couldn't a 3D printer operate in this fashion,
p45
aVwhere you have an object arise out of a puddle
p46
aVin essentially real time
p47
aVwith essentially no waste
p48
aVto make a great object?
p49
aVOkay, just like the movies.
p50
aVAnd could we be inspired by Hollywood
p51
aVand come up with ways to actually try to get this to work?
p52
aVAnd that was our challenge.
p53
aVAnd our approach would be, if we could do this,
p54
aVthen we could fundamentally address the three issues holding back 3D printing
p55
aVfrom being a manufacturing process.
p56
aa(lp57
VOne, 3D printing takes forever.
p58
aVThere are mushrooms that grow faster than 3D printed parts. (Laughter)
p59
aVThe layer by layer process
p60
aVleads to defects in mechanical properties,
p61
aVand if we could grow continuously, we could eliminate those defects.
p62
aVAnd in fact, if we could grow really fast, we could also start using materials
p63
aVthat are self-curing, and we could have amazing properties.
p64
aVSo if we could pull this off, imitate Hollywood,
p65
aVwe could in fact address 3D manufacturing.
p66
aa(lp67
VOur approach is to use some standard knowledge
p68
aVin polymer chemistry
p69
aVto harness light and oxygen to grow parts continuously.
p70
aVLight and oxygen work in different ways.
p71
aVLight can take a resin and convert it to a solid,
p72
aVcan convert a liquid to a solid.
p73
aVOxygen inhibits that process.
p74
aVSo light and oxygen are polar opposites from one another
p75
aVfrom a chemical point of view,
p76
aVand if we can control spatially the light and oxygen,
p77
aVwe could control this process.
p78
aVAnd we refer to this as CLIP. [Continuous Liquid Interface Production.]
p79
aVIt has three functional components.
p80
aVOne, it has a reservoir that holds the puddle,
p81
aVjust like the T-1000.
p82
aVAt the bottom of the reservoir is a special window.
p83
aVI'll come back to that.
p84
aVIn addition, it has a stage that will lower into the puddle
p85
aVand pull the object out of the liquid.
p86
aVThe third component is a digital light projection system
p87
aVunderneath the reservoir,
p88
aVilluminating with light in the ultraviolet region.
p89
aa(lp90
VNow, the key is that this window in the bottom of this reservoir,
p91
aVit's a composite, it's a very special window.
p92
aVIt's not only transparent to light but it's permeable to oxygen.
p93
aVIt's got characteristics like a contact lens.
p94
aVSo we can see how the process works.
p95
aVYou can start to see that as you lower a stage in there,
p96
aVin a traditional process, with an oxygen-impermeable window,
p97
aVyou make a two-dimensional pattern
p98
aVand you end up gluing that onto the window with a traditional window,
p99
aVand so in order to introduce the next layer, you have to separate it,
p100
aVintroduce new resin, reposition it,
p101
aVand do this process over and over again.
p102
aVBut with our very special window,
p103
aVwhat we're able to do is, with oxygen coming through the bottom
p104
aVas light hits it,
p105
aVthat oxygen inhibits the reaction,
p106
aVand we form a dead zone.
p107
aVThis dead zone is on the order of tens of microns thick,
p108
aVso that's two or three diameters of a red blood cell,
p109
aVright at the window interface that remains a liquid,
p110
aVand we pull this object up,
p111
aVand as we talked about in a Science paper,
p112
aVas we change the oxygen content, we can change the dead zone thickness.
p113
aVAnd so we have a number of key variables that we control: oxygen content,
p114
aVthe light, the light intensity, the dose to cure,
p115
aVthe viscosity, the geometry,
p116
aVand we use very sophisticated software to control this process.
p117
aa(lp118
VThe result is pretty staggering.
p119
aVIt's 25 to 100 times faster than traditional 3D printers,
p120
aVwhich is game-changing.
p121
aVIn addition, as our ability to deliver liquid to that interface,
p122
aVwe can go 1,000 times faster I believe,
p123
aVand that in fact opens up the opportunity for generating a lot of heat,
p124
aVand as a chemical engineer, I get very excited at heat transfer
p125
aVand the idea that we might one day have water-cooled 3D printers,
p126
aVbecause they're going so fast.
p127
aVIn addition, because we're growing things, we eliminate the layers,
p128
aVand the parts are monolithic.
p129
aVYou don't see the surface structure.
p130
aVYou have molecularly smooth surfaces.
p131
aVAnd the mechanical properties of most parts made in a 3D printer
p132
aVare notorious for having properties that depend on the orientation
p133
aVwith which how you printed it, because of the layer-like structure.
p134
aVBut when you grow objects like this,
p135
aVthe properties are invariant with the print direction.
p136
aVThese look like injection-molded parts,
p137
aVwhich is very different than traditional 3D manufacturing.
p138
aVIn addition, we're able to throw
p139
aVthe entire polymer chemistry textbook at this,
p140
aVand we're able to design chemistries that can give rise to the properties
p141
aVyou really want in a 3D-printed object.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Applause)
p144
aa(lp145
VThere it is. That's great.
p146
aVYou always take the risk that something like this won't work onstage, right?
p147
aa(lp148
VBut we can have materials with great mechanical properties.
p149
aVFor the first time, we can have elastomers
p150
aVthat are high elasticity or high dampening.
p151
aVThink about vibration control or great sneakers, for example.
p152
aVWe can make materials that have incredible strength,
p153
aVhigh strength-to-weight ratio, really strong materials,
p154
aVreally great elastomers,
p155
aVso throw that in the audience there.
p156
aVSo great material properties.
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd so the opportunity now, if you actually make a part
p159
aVthat has the properties to be a final part,
p160
aVand you do it in game-changing speeds,
p161
aVyou can actually transform manufacturing.
p162
aVRight now, in manufacturing, what happens is,
p163
aVthe so-called digital thread in digital manufacturing.
p164
aVWe go from a CAD drawing, a design, to a prototype to manufacturing.
p165
aVOften, the digital thread is broken right at prototype,
p166
aVbecause you can't go all the way to manufacturing
p167
aVbecause most parts don't have the properties to be a final part.
p168
aVWe now can connect the digital thread
p169
aVall the way from design to prototyping to manufacturing,
p170
aVand that opportunity really opens up all sorts of things,
p171
aVfrom better fuel-efficient cars dealing with great lattice properties
p172
aVwith high strength-to-weight ratio,
p173
aVnew turbine blades, all sorts of wonderful things.
p174
aa(lp175
VThink about if you need a stent in an emergency situation,
p176
aVinstead of the doctor pulling off a stent out of the shelf
p177
aVthat was just standard sizes,
p178
aVhaving a stent that's designed for you, for your own anatomy
p179
aVwith your own tributaries,
p180
aVprinted in an emergency situation in real time out of the properties
p181
aVsuch that the stent could go away after 18 months: really-game changing.
p182
aVOr digital dentistry, and making these kinds of structures
p183
aVeven while you're in the dentist chair.
p184
aVAnd look at the structures that my students are making
p185
aVat the University of North Carolina.
p186
aVThese are amazing microscale structures.
p187
aa(lp188
VYou know, the world is really good at nano-fabrication.
p189
aVMoore's Law has driven things from 10 microns and below.
p190
aVWe're really good at that,
p191
aVbut it's actually very hard to make things from 10 microns to 1,000 microns,
p192
aVthe mesoscale.
p193
aVAnd subtractive techniques from the silicon industry
p194
aVcan't do that very well.
p195
aVThey can't etch wafers that well.
p196
aVBut this process is so gentle,
p197
aVwe can grow these objects up from the bottom
p198
aVusing additive manufacturing
p199
aVand make amazing things in tens of seconds,
p200
aVopening up new sensor technologies,
p201
aVnew drug delivery techniques,
p202
aVnew lab-on-a-chip applications, really game-changing stuff.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo the opportunity of making a part in real time
p205
aVthat has the properties to be a final part
p206
aVreally opens up 3D manufacturing,
p207
aVand for us, this is very exciting, because this really is owning
p208
aVthe intersection between hardware, software and molecular science,
p209
aVand I can't wait to see what designers and engineers around the world
p210
aVare going to be able to do with this great tool.
p211
aa(lp212
VThanks for listening.

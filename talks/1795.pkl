VSo if I was to ask you
p5
aVwhat the connection between
p6
aVa bottle of Tide detergent and sweat was,
p7
aVyou'd probably think that's the easiest question
p8
aVthat you're going to be asked in Edinburgh all week.
p9
aVBut if I was to say that they're both examples
p10
aVof alternative or new forms of currency
p11
aVin a hyperconnected, data-driven global economy,
p12
aVyou'd probably think I was a little bit bonkers.
p13
aVBut trust me, I work in advertising.
p14
aa(lp15
V(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd I am going to tell you the answer,
p18
aVbut obviously after this short break.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo a more challenging question is one
p21
aVthat I was asked, actually, by one of our writers
p22
aVa couple of weeks ago, and I didn't know the answer:
p23
aVWhat's the world's best performing currency?
p24
aVIt's actually Bitcoin.
p25
aVNow, for those of you who may not be familiar,
p26
aVBitcoin is a crypto-currency, a virtual currency, synthetic currency.
p27
aVIt was founded in 2008 by this anonymous programmer
p28
aVusing a pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.
p29
aVNo one knows who or what he is.
p30
aVHe's almost like the Banksy of the Internet.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd I'm probably not going to do it proper service here,
p33
aVbut my interpretation of how it works is that
p34
aVBitcoins are released through this process of mining.
p35
aVSo there's a network of computers that are challenged
p36
aVto solve a very complex mathematical problem
p37
aVand the person that manages to solve it first gets the Bitcoins.
p38
aVAnd the Bitcoins are released,
p39
aVthey're put into a public ledger called the Blockchain,
p40
aVand then they float, so they become a currency,
p41
aVand completely decentralized, that's the sort of
p42
aVscary thing about this, which is why it's so popular.
p43
aVSo it's not run by the authorities or the state.
p44
aVIt's actually managed by the network.
p45
aVAnd the reason that it's proved very successful
p46
aVis it's private, it's anonymous, it's fast, and it's cheap.
p47
aVAnd you do get to the point where there's some wild fluctuations with Bitcoin.
p48
aVSo in one level it went from something like 13 dollars
p49
aVto 266, literally in the space of four months,
p50
aVand then crashed and lost half of its value in six hours.
p51
aVAnd it's currently around that kind of
p52
aV110 dollar mark in value.
p53
aa(lp54
VBut what it does show is that it's sort of gaining ground,
p55
aVit's gaining respectability.
p56
aVYou get services, like Reddit and Wordpress
p57
aVare actually accepting Bitcoin as a payment currency now.
p58
aVAnd that's showing you that people
p59
aVare actually placing trust in technology,
p60
aVand it's started to trump and disrupt
p61
aVand interrogate traditional institutions
p62
aVand how we think about currencies and money.
p63
aVAnd that's not surprising, if you think about
p64
aVthe basket case that is the E.U.
p65
aVI think there was a Gallup survey out recently
p66
aVthat said something like, in America,
p67
aVtrust in banks is at an all-time low, it's something like 21 percent.
p68
aVAnd you can see here some photographs from London
p69
aVwhere Barclays sponsored the city bike scheme,
p70
aVand some activists have done some nice piece
p71
aVof guerrilla marketing here and doctored the slogans.
p72
aV"Sub-prime pedaling." "Barclays takes you for a ride."
p73
aVThese are the more polite ones I could share with you today.
p74
aVBut you get the gist, so people have really started
p75
aVto sort of lose faith in institutions.
p76
aa(lp77
VThere's a P.R. company called Edelman,
p78
aVthey do this very interesting survey every year
p79
aVprecisely around trust and what people are thinking.
p80
aVAnd this is a global survey, so these numbers are global.
p81
aVAnd what's interesting is that you can see that
p82
aVhierarchy is having a bit of a wobble,
p83
aVand it's all about heterarchical now,
p84
aVso people trust people like themselves more
p85
aVthan they trust corporations and governments.
p86
aVAnd if you look at these figures for the more developed markets
p87
aVlike U.K., Germany, and so on, they're actually much lower.
p88
aVAnd I find that sort of scary.
p89
aVPeople are actually trusting businesspeople
p90
aVmore than they're trusting governments and leaders.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo what's starting to happen, if you think about money,
p93
aVif you sort of boil money down to an essence,
p94
aVit is literally just an expression of value, an agreed value.
p95
aVSo what's happening now, in the digital age,
p96
aVis that we can quantify value in lots of different ways
p97
aVand do it more easily,
p98
aVand sometimes the way that we quantify those values,
p99
aVit makes it much easier
p100
aVto create new forms and valid forms of currency.
p101
aVIn that context, you can see that networks like Bitcoin
p102
aVsuddenly start to make a bit more sense.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo if you think we're starting to question
p105
aVand disrupt and interrogate what money means,
p106
aVwhat our relationship with it is, what defines money,
p107
aVthen the ultimate extension of that is,
p108
aVis there a reason for the government to be in charge
p109
aVof money anymore?
p110
aVSo obviously I'm looking at this through a marketing prism,
p111
aVso from a brand perspective,
p112
aVbrands literally stand or fall on their reputations.
p113
aVAnd if you think about it, reputation has now become a currency.
p114
aVYou know, reputations are built on trust,
p115
aVconsistency, transparency.
p116
aVSo if you've actually decided that you trust a brand,
p117
aVyou want a relationship, you want to engage with the brand,
p118
aVyou're already kind of participating in lots of new forms
p119
aVof currency.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo you think about loyalty.
p122
aVLoyalty essentially is a micro-economy.
p123
aVYou think about rewards schemes, air miles.
p124
aVThe Economist said a few years ago that
p125
aVthere are actually more unredeemed air miles in the world
p126
aVthan there are dollar bills in circulation.
p127
aVYou know, when you are standing in line in Starbucks,
p128
aV30 percent of transactions in Starbucks on any one day
p129
aVare actually being made with Starbucks Star points.
p130
aVSo that's a sort of Starbucks currency
p131
aVstaying within its ecosystem.
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd what I find interesting is that Amazon
p134
aVhas recently launched Amazon coins.
p135
aVSo admittedly it's a currency at the moment that's purely for the Kindle.
p136
aVSo you can buy apps and make purchases within those apps,
p137
aVbut you think about Amazon,
p138
aVyou look at the trust barometer that I showed you
p139
aVwhere people are starting to trust businesses,
p140
aVespecially businesses that they believe in and trust
p141
aVmore than governments.
p142
aVSo suddenly, you start thinking,
p143
aVwell Amazon potentially could push this.
p144
aVIt could become a natural extension,
p145
aVthat as well as buying stuff \u2014
p146
aVtake it out of the Kindle \u2014 you could buy books, music,
p147
aVreal-life products, appliances and goods and so on.
p148
aVAnd suddenly you're getting Amazon, as a brand,
p149
aVis going head to head with the Federal Reserve
p150
aVin terms of how you want to spend your money,
p151
aVwhat money is, what constitutes money.
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd I'll get you back to Tide, the detergent now,
p154
aVas I promised.
p155
aVThis is a fantastic article I came across in New York Magazine,
p156
aVwhere it was saying that drug users across America
p157
aVare actually purchasing drugs
p158
aVwith bottles of Tide detergent.
p159
aVSo they're going into convenience stores,
p160
aVstealing Tide,
p161
aVand a $20 bottle of Tide
p162
aVis equal to 10 dollars of crack cocaine or weed.
p163
aVAnd what they're saying, so some criminologists
p164
aVhave looked at this and they're saying, well, okay,
p165
aVTide as a product sells at a premium.
p166
aVIt's 50 percent above the category average.
p167
aVIt's infused with a very complex cocktail of chemicals,
p168
aVso it smells very luxurious and very distinctive,
p169
aVand, being a Procter and Gamble brand,
p170
aVit's been supported by a lot of mass media advertising.
p171
aVSo what they're saying is that drug users are consumers too,
p172
aVso they have this in their neural pathways.
p173
aVWhen they spot Tide, there's a shortcut.
p174
aVThey say, that is trust. I trust that. That's quality.
p175
aVSo it becomes this unit of currency,
p176
aVwhich the New York Magazine described
p177
aVas a very oddly loyal crime wave, brand-loyal crime wave,
p178
aVand criminals are actually calling Tide "liquid gold."
p179
aa(lp180
VNow, what I thought was funny was the reaction
p181
aVfrom the P&G spokesperson.
p182
aVThey said, obviously tried to dissociate themselves from drugs,
p183
aVbut said, "It reminds me of one thing
p184
aVand that's the value of the brand has stayed consistent." (Laughter)
p185
aVWhich backs up my point and shows he didn't even
p186
aVbreak a sweat when he said that.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo that brings me back to the connection with sweat.
p189
aVIn Mexico, Nike has run a campaign recently
p190
aVcalled, literally, Bid Your Sweat.
p191
aVSo you think about,
p192
aVthese Nike shoes have got sensors in them,
p193
aVor you're using a Nike FuelBand
p194
aVthat basically tracks your movement, your energy,
p195
aVyour calorie consumption.
p196
aVAnd what's happening here, this is where you've actually
p197
aVelected to join that Nike community. You've bought into it.
p198
aVThey're not advertising loud messages at you,
p199
aVand that's where advertising has started to shift now
p200
aVis into things like services, tools and applications.
p201
aVSo Nike is literally acting as a well-being partner,
p202
aVa health and fitness partner and service provider.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo what happens with this is they're saying, "Right,
p205
aVyou have a data dashboard. We know how far you've run,
p206
aVhow far you've moved, what your calorie intake, all that sort of stuff.
p207
aVWhat you can do is, the more you run, the more points you get,
p208
aVand we have an auction where you can buy Nike stuff
p209
aVbut only by proving that you've actually used the product to do stuff."
p210
aVAnd you can't come into this. This is purely
p211
aVfor the community that are sweating
p212
aVusing Nike products. You can't buy stuff with pesos.
p213
aVThis is literally a closed environment, a closed auction space.
p214
aa(lp215
VIn Africa, you know, airtime has become
p216
aVliterally a currency in its own right.
p217
aVPeople are used to, because mobile is king,
p218
aVthey're very, very used to transferring money,
p219
aVmaking payments via mobile.
p220
aVAnd one of my favorite examples from a brand perspective
p221
aVgoing on is Vodafone, where, in Egypt,
p222
aVlots of people make purchases in markets
p223
aVand very small independent stores.
p224
aVLoose change, small change is a real problem,
p225
aVand what tends to happen is you buy a bunch of stuff,
p226
aVyou're due, say,
p227
aV10 cents, 20 cents in change.
p228
aVThe shopkeepers tend to give you things like an onion
p229
aVor an aspirin, or a piece of gum,
p230
aVbecause they don't have small change.
p231
aVSo when Vodafone came in and saw this problem,
p232
aVthis consumer pain point, they created
p233
aVsome small change which they call Fakka,
p234
aVwhich literally sits and is given
p235
aVby the shopkeepers to people,
p236
aVand it's credit that goes straight onto their mobile phone.
p237
aVSo this currency becomes credit, which again,
p238
aVis really, really interesting.
p239
aa(lp240
VAnd we did a survey that backs up the fact that,
p241
aVyou know, 45 percent of people
p242
aVin this very crucial demographic in the U.S.
p243
aVwere saying that they're comfortable using
p244
aVan independent or branded currency.
p245
aVSo that's getting really interesting here,
p246
aVa really interesting dynamic going on.
p247
aVAnd you think, corporations
p248
aVshould start taking their assets and thinking of them
p249
aVin a different way and trading them.
p250
aVAnd you think, is it much of a leap?
p251
aVIt seems farfetched, but when you think about it,
p252
aVin America in 1860,
p253
aVthere were 1,600 corporations issuing banknotes.
p254
aVThere were 8,000 kinds of notes in America.
p255
aVAnd the only thing that stopped that,
p256
aVthe government controlled four percent of the supply,
p257
aVand the only thing that stopped it
p258
aVwas the Civil War breaking out,
p259
aVand the government suddenly wanted to take control of the money.
p260
aVSo government, money, war, nothing changes there, then.
p261
aa(lp262
VSo what I'm going to ask is, basically,
p263
aVis history repeating itself?
p264
aVIs technology making paper money feel outmoded?
p265
aVAre we decoupling money from the government?
p266
aVYou know, you think about, brands are starting to fill the gaps.
p267
aVCorporations are filling gaps that governments can't afford to fill.
p268
aVSo I think, you know, will we be standing on stage
p269
aVbuying a coffee \u2014 organic, fair trade coffee \u2014 next year
p270
aVusing TED florins or TED shillings?
p271
aa(lp272
VThank you very much.
p273
aa(lp274
V(Applause)
p275
aa(lp276
VThank you. (Applause)

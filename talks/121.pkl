VThe immersive ugliness
p5
aVof our everyday environments in America
p6
aVis entropy made visible.
p7
aVWe can't overestimate the amount of despair
p8
aVthat we are generating with places like this.
p9
aVAnd mostly, I want to persuade you that we have to do better
p10
aVif we're going to continue the project of civilization in America.
p11
aVBy the way, this doesn't help.
p12
aVNobody's having a better day down here because of that.
p13
aa(lp14
VThere are a lot of ways you can describe this.
p15
aVYou know, I like to call it "the national automobile slum."
p16
aVYou can call it suburban sprawl.
p17
aVI think it's appropriate to call it
p18
aVthe greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world.
p19
aVYou can call it a technosis externality clusterfuck.
p20
aVAnd it's a tremendous problem for us.
p21
aVThe outstanding \u2014 the salient problem about this for us
p22
aVis that these are places that are not worth caring about.
p23
aVWe're going to talk about that some more.
p24
aVA sense of place:
p25
aVyour ability to create places that are meaningful and places of quality and character
p26
aVdepends entirely on your ability to define space with buildings,
p27
aVand to employ the vocabularies, grammars,
p28
aVsyntaxes, rhythms and patterns of architecture
p29
aVin order to inform us who we are.
p30
aa(lp31
VThe public realm in America has two roles:
p32
aVit is the dwelling place of our civilization and our civic life,
p33
aVand it is the physical manifestation of the common good.
p34
aVAnd when you degrade the public realm,
p35
aVyou will automatically degrade the quality of your civic life
p36
aVand the character of all the enactments of your public life and communal life that take place there.
p37
aVThe public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in America
p38
aVbecause we don't have the 1,000-year-old cathedral plazas
p39
aVand market squares of older cultures.
p40
aVAnd your ability to define space and to create places that are worth caring about
p41
aVall comes from a body of culture that we call the culture of civic design.
p42
aVThis is a body of knowledge, method, skill and principle
p43
aVthat we threw in the garbage after World War II
p44
aVand decided we don't need that anymore; we're not going to use it.
p45
aVAnd consequently, we can see the result all around us.
p46
aVThe public realm has to inform us not only where we are geographically,
p47
aVbut it has to inform us where we are in our culture.
p48
aVWhere we've come from, what kind of people we are, and it needs to,
p49
aVby doing that, it needs to afford us a glimpse to where we're going
p50
aVin order to allow us to dwell in a hopeful present.
p51
aVAnd if there is one tremendous \u2014
p52
aVif there is one great catastrophe about the places that we've built,
p53
aVthe human environments we've made for ourselves in the last 50 years,
p54
aVit is that it has deprived us of the ability to live in a hopeful present.
p55
aa(lp56
VThe environments we are living in, more typically, are like these.
p57
aVYou know, this happens to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two miles north of my town.
p58
aVAnd remember, to create a place of character and quality,
p59
aVyou have to be able to define space.
p60
aVSo how is that being accomplished here?
p61
aVIf you stand on the apron of the Wal-Mart over here
p62
aVand try to look at the Target store over here,
p63
aVyou can't see it because of the curvature of the Earth. (Laughter)
p64
aVThat's nature's way of telling you that you're doing a poor job of defining space.
p65
aVConsequently, these will be places that nobody wants to be in.
p66
aVThese will be places that are not worth caring about.
p67
aa(lp68
VWe have about, you know, 38,000 places
p69
aVthat are not worth caring about in the United States today.
p70
aVWhen we have enough of them, we're going to have a nation that's not worth defending.
p71
aVAnd I want you to think about that when you think about
p72
aVthose young men and women who are over in places like Iraq,
p73
aVspilling their blood in the sand,
p74
aVand ask yourself, "What is their last thought of home?"
p75
aVI hope it's not the curb cut between the Chuck E. Cheese and the Target store
p76
aVbecause that's not good enough for Americans to be spilling their blood for. (Applause)
p77
aVWe need better places in this country.
p78
aa(lp79
VPublic space. This is a good public space.
p80
aVIt's a place worth caring about. It's well defined.
p81
aVIt is emphatically an outdoor public room.
p82
aVIt has something that is terribly important \u2014
p83
aVit has what's called an active and permeable membrane around the edge.
p84
aVThat's a fancy way of saying it's got shops, bars, bistros, destinations \u2014
p85
aVthings go in and out of it. It's permeable.
p86
aVThe beer goes in and out, the waitresses go in and out,
p87
aVand that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in.
p88
aVYou know, in these places in other cultures,
p89
aVpeople just go there voluntarily because they like them.
p90
aVWe don't have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here. (Laughter)
p91
aVYou know, you don't have to have a Kwanzaa festival.
p92
aVPeople just go because it's pleasurable to be there.
p93
aVBut this is how we do it in the United States.
p94
aa(lp95
VProbably the most significant public space failure in America,
p96
aVdesigned by the leading architects of the day, Harry Cobb and I.M. Pei:
p97
aVBoston City Hall Plaza.
p98
aVA public place so dismal that the winos don't even want to go there. (Laughter)
p99
aVAnd we can't fix it because I.M. Pei's still alive,
p100
aVand every year Harvard and M.I.T. have a joint committee to repair it.
p101
aVAnd every year they fail to because they don't want to hurt I.M. Pei's feelings.
p102
aa(lp103
VThis is the other side of the building.
p104
aVThis was the winner of an international design award in, I think, 1966, something like that.
p105
aVIt wasn't Pei and Cobb, another firm designed this,
p106
aVbut there's not enough Prozac in the world to make people feel OK about going down this block.
p107
aVThis is the back of Boston City Hall,
p108
aVthe most important, you know, significant civic building in Albany \u2014 excuse me \u2014 in Boston.
p109
aVAnd what is the message that is coming,
p110
aVwhat are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming, from this building
p111
aVand how is it informing us about who we are?
p112
aa(lp113
VThis, in fact, would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits
p114
aVof Josef Stalin, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein,
p115
aVand all the other great despots of the 20th century on the side of the building,
p116
aVbecause then we'd honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us.
p117
aVYou know, that it's a despotic building;
p118
aVit wants us to feel like termites. (Laughter)
p119
aVThis is it on a smaller scale:
p120
aVthe back of the civic center in my town, Saratoga Springs, New York.
p121
aVBy the way, when I showed this slide to a group of Kiwanians in my town,
p122
aVthey all rose in indignation from their creamed chicken, (Laughter)
p123
aVand they shouted at me and said,
p124
aV"It was raining that day when you took that picture!"
p125
aVBecause this was perceived to be a weather problem. (Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VYou know, this is a building designed like a DVD player. (Laughter)
p128
aVAudio jack, power supply \u2014
p129
aVand look, you know these things are important architectural jobs for firms, right?
p130
aVYou know, we hire firms to design these things.
p131
aVYou can see exactly what went on, three o'clock in the morning at the design meeting.
p132
aVYou know, eight hours before deadline,
p133
aVfour architects trying to get this building in on time, right?
p134
aVAnd they're sitting there at the long boardroom table
p135
aVwith all the drawings, and the renderings,
p136
aVand all the Chinese food caskets are lying on the table, and \u2014
p137
aVI mean, what was the conversation that was going on there? (Laughter)
p138
aVBecause you know what the last word was, what the last sentence was of that meeting.
p139
aVIt was: "Fuck it." (Laughter) (Applause)
p140
aa(lp141
VThat \u2014 that is the message of this form of architecture.
p142
aVThe message is: We don't give a fuck! We don't give a fuck.
p143
aVSo I went back on the nicest day of the year, just to \u2014
p144
aVyou know \u2014 do some reality testing,
p145
aVand in fact, he will not even go down there because (Laughter)
p146
aVit's not interesting enough for his clients,
p147
aVyou know, the burglars, the muggers.
p148
aVIt's not civically rich enough for them to go down there.
p149
aVOK.
p150
aa(lp151
VThe pattern of Main Street USA \u2014
p152
aVin fact, this pattern of building downtown blocks, all over the world, is fairly universal.
p153
aVIt's not that complicated:
p154
aVbuildings more than one story high, built out to the sidewalk edge,
p155
aVso that people who are, you know, all kinds of people can get into the building.
p156
aVOther activities are allowed to occur upstairs,
p157
aVyou know, apartments, offices, and so on.
p158
aVYou make provision for this activity called shopping on the ground floor.
p159
aVThey haven't learned that in Monterey.
p160
aVIf you go out to the corner right at the main intersection right in front of this conference center,
p161
aVyou'll see an intersection with four blank walls on every corner.
p162
aVIt's really incredible.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnyway, this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building,
p165
aVand this is what happened when in Glens Falls, New York,
p166
aVwhen we tried to do it again, where it was missing, right?
p167
aVSo the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story above grade to make it sporty.
p168
aVOK. That completely destroys the relationship between the business and the sidewalk,
p169
aVwhere the theoretical pedestrians are. (Laughter)
p170
aVOf course, they'll never be there, as long as this is in that condition.
p171
aVThen because the relationship between the retail is destroyed,
p172
aVwe pop a handicapped ramp on that,
p173
aVand then to make ourselves feel better, we put a nature Band-Aid in front of it.
p174
aVAnd that's how we do it.
p175
aVI call them "nature Band-Aids" because there's a general idea in America
p176
aVthat the remedy for mutilated urbanism is nature.
p177
aVAnd in fact, the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism, good buildings.
p178
aVNot just flower beds, not just cartoons of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.
p179
aVYou know, that's not good enough.
p180
aVWe have to do good buildings.
p181
aa(lp182
VThe street trees have really four jobs to do and that's it:
p183
aVTo spatially denote the pedestrian realm,
p184
aVto protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carriageway,
p185
aVto filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk,
p186
aVand to soften the hardscape of the buildings
p187
aVand to create a ceiling \u2014 a vaulted ceiling \u2014 over the street, at its best.
p188
aVAnd that's it. Those are the four jobs of the street trees.
p189
aVThey're not supposed to be a cartoon of the North Woods;
p190
aVthey're not supposed to be a set for "The Last of the Mohicans."
p191
aa(lp192
VYou know, one of the problems with the fiasco of suburbia is that it destroyed our understanding
p193
aVof the distinction between the country and the town, between the urban and the rural.
p194
aVThey're not the same thing.
p195
aVAnd we're not going to cure the problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city,
p196
aVwhich is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time.
p197
aVHere you see it on a small scale \u2014 the mothership has landed,
p198
aVR2-D2 and C-3PO have stepped out to test the bark mulch
p199
aVto see if they can inhabit this planet. (Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
VA lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in America was such a trauma
p202
aVthat we developed this tremendous aversion for the whole idea of the city,
p203
aVcity life, and everything connected with it.
p204
aVAnd so what you see fairly early, in the mid-19th century,
p205
aVis this idea that we now have to have an antidote to the industrial city,
p206
aVwhich is going to be life in the country for everybody.
p207
aVAnd that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb:
p208
aVthe country villa along the railroad line,
p209
aVwhich allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city,
p210
aVbut to return to the countryside every night.
p211
aVAnd believe me, there were no Wal-Marts or convenience stores out there then,
p212
aVso it really was a form of country living.
p213
aa(lp214
VBut what happens is, of course, it mutates over the next 80 years
p215
aVand it turns into something rather insidious.
p216
aVIt becomes a cartoon of a country house, in a cartoon of the country.
p217
aVAnd that's the great non-articulated agony of suburbia
p218
aVand one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule.
p219
aVBecause it hasn't delivered what it's been promising for half a century now.
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd these are typically the kind of dwellings we find there, you know.
p222
aVBasically, a house with nothing on the side
p223
aVbecause this house wants to state, emphatically,
p224
aV"I'm a little cabin in the woods. There's nothing on either side of me.
p225
aVI don't have any eyes on the side of my head. I can't see."
p226
aVSo you have this one last facade of the house,
p227
aVthe front, which is really a cartoon of a facade of a house.
p228
aVBecause \u2014 notice the porch here.
p229
aVUnless the people that live here are Munchkins, nobody's going to be using that.
p230
aVThis is really, in fact, a television broadcasting a show 24/7 called "We're Normal."
p231
aVWe're normal, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal.
p232
aVPlease respect us, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal.
p233
aa(lp234
VBut we know what's going on in these houses, you know.
p235
aVWe know that little Skippy is loading his Uzi down here,
p236
aVgetting ready for homeroom. (Laughter)
p237
aVWe know that Heather, his sister Heather, 14 years old,
p238
aVis turning tricks up here to support her drug habit.
p239
aVBecause these places, these habitats,
p240
aVare inducing immense amounts of anxiety and depression in children,
p241
aVand they don't have a lot of experience with medication.
p242
aVSo they take the first one that comes along, often.
p243
aVThese are not good enough for Americans.
p244
aVThese are the schools we are sending them to:
p245
aVThe Hannibal Lecter Central School, Las Vegas, Nevada.
p246
aVThis is a real school!
p247
aVYou know, but there's obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out,
p248
aVthat they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver.
p249
aVSo every effort is made to keep them within the building.
p250
aVNotice that nature is present. (Laughter)
p251
aa(lp252
VWe're going to have to change this behavior whether we like it or not.
p253
aVWe are entering an epochal period of change in the world, and \u2014 certainly in America
p254
aV\u2014 the period that will be characterized by the end of the cheap oil era.
p255
aVIt is going to change absolutely everything.
p256
aVChris asked me not to go on too long about this, and I won't,
p257
aVexcept to say there's not going to be a hydrogen economy.
p258
aVForget it. It's not going to happen.
p259
aVWe're going to have to do something else instead.
p260
aVWe're going to have to down-scale, re-scale, and re-size
p261
aVvirtually everything we do in this country and we can't start soon enough to do it.
p262
aVWe're going to have \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 we're going to have to live closer to where we work.
p263
aVWe're going to have to live closer to each other.
p264
aVWe're going have to grow more food closer to where we live.
p265
aVThe age of the 3,000 mile Caesar salad is coming to an end.
p266
aVWe're going to have to \u2014 we have a railroad system that the Bulgarians would be ashamed of!
p267
aVWe gotta do better than that!
p268
aa(lp269
VAnd we should have started two days before yesterday.
p270
aVWe are fortunate that the new urbanists were there, for the last 10 years,
p271
aVexcavating all that information that was thrown in the garbage
p272
aVby our parents' generation after World War II.
p273
aVBecause we're going to need it if we're going to learn how to reconstruct towns.
p274
aVWe're going to need to get back this body of methodology and principle and skill
p275
aVin order to re-learn how to compose meaningful places, places that are integral,
p276
aVthat allow \u2014 that are living organisms in the sense that they contain all the organs of our civic life
p277
aVand our communal life, deployed in an integral fashion.
p278
aa(lp279
VSo that, you know, the residences make sense
p280
aVdeployed in relation to the places of business, of culture and of governance.
p281
aVWe're going to have to re-learn what the building blocks of these things are:
p282
aVthe street, the block, how to compose public space that's both large and small,
p283
aVthe courtyard, the civic square
p284
aVand how to really make use of this property.
p285
aVWe can see some of the first ideas
p286
aVfor retro-fitting some of the catastrophic property that we have in America.
p287
aVThe dead malls: what are we going to do with them?
p288
aVWell, in point of fact, most of them are not going to make it.
p289
aVThey're not going to be retro-fitted;
p290
aVthey're going to be the salvage yards of the future.
p291
aa(lp292
VSome of them we're going to fix, though.
p293
aVAnd we're going to fix them by imposing back on them street and block systems
p294
aVand returning to the building lot as the normal increment of development.
p295
aVAnd if we're lucky, the result will be revivified town centers and neighborhood centers
p296
aVin our existing towns and cities.
p297
aVAnd by the way, our towns and cities are where they are, and grew where they were
p298
aVbecause they occupy all the important sites.
p299
aVAnd most of them are still going to be there,
p300
aValthough the scale of them is probably going to be diminished.
p301
aa(lp302
VWe've got a lot of work to do.
p303
aVWe're not going to be rescued by the hyper-car; we're not going to be rescued by alternative fuels.
p304
aVNo amount or combination of alternative fuels
p305
aVis going to allow us to continue running what we're running, the way we're running it.
p306
aVWe're going to have to do everything very differently.
p307
aVAnd America's not prepared.
p308
aVWe are sleepwalking into the future.
p309
aVWe're not ready for what's coming at us.
p310
aVSo I urge you all to do what you can.
p311
aVLife in the mid-21st century is going to be about living locally.
p312
aVBe prepared to be good neighbors.
p313
aVBe prepared to find vocations that make you useful
p314
aVto your neighbors and to your fellow citizens.
p315
aa(lp316
VOne final thing \u2014 I've been very disturbed about this for years,
p317
aVbut I think it's particularly important for this audience.
p318
aVPlease, please, stop referring to yourselves as "consumers." OK?
p319
aVConsumers are different than citizens.
p320
aVConsumers do not have obligations, responsibilities and duties
p321
aVto their fellow human beings.
p322
aVAnd as long as you're using that word consumer in the public discussion,
p323
aVyou will be degrading the quality of the discussion we're having.
p324
aVAnd we're going to continue being clueless
p325
aVgoing into this very difficult future that we face.
p326
aVSo thank you very much.
p327
aVPlease go out and do what you can to make this a land full of places that are worth caring about
p328
aVand a nation that will be worth defending. (Applause)

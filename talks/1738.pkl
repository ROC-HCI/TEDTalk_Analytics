VThank you very much.
p5
aa(lp6
VI moved to America 12 years ago with my wife Terry and our two kids.
p7
aVActually, truthfully, we moved to Los Angeles \u2014
p8
aa(lp9
V(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
Vthinking we were moving to America, but anyway \u2014
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VIt's a short plane ride from Los Angeles to America.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VI got here 12 years ago,
p20
aVand when I got here, I was told various things,
p21
aVlike, "Americans don't get irony."
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VHave you come across this idea?
p26
aVIt's not true.
p27
aVI've traveled the whole length and breadth of this country.
p28
aVI have found no evidence that Americans don't get irony.
p29
aVIt's one of those cultural myths,
p30
aVlike, "The British are reserved."
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VI don't know why people think this.
p35
aVWe've invaded every country we've encountered.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VBut it's not true Americans don't get irony,
p40
aVbut I just want you to know that that's what people
p41
aVare saying about you behind your back.
p42
aVYou know, so when you leave living rooms in Europe,
p43
aVpeople say, thankfully, nobody was ironic in your presence.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VBut I knew that Americans get irony
p48
aVwhen I came across that legislation, "No Child Left Behind."
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VBecause whoever thought of that title gets irony.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VDon't they?
p57
aa(lp58
V(Applause)
p59
aa(lp60
VBecause it's leaving millions of children behind.
p61
aVNow I can see that's not a very attractive name for legislation:
p62
aV"Millions of Children Left Behind."
p63
aVI can see that.
p64
aVWhat's the plan?
p65
aVWe propose to leave millions of children behind,
p66
aVand here's how it's going to work.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd it's working beautifully.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VIn some parts of the country,
p73
aV60 percent of kids drop out of high school.
p74
aVIn the Native American communities,
p75
aVit's 80 percent of kids.
p76
aVIf we halved that number,
p77
aVone estimate is it would create a net gain to the U.S. economy
p78
aVover 10 years, of nearly a trillion dollars.
p79
aVFrom an economic point of view,
p80
aVthis is good math, isn't it, that we should do this?
p81
aVIt actually costs an enormous amount
p82
aVto mop up the damage from the dropout crisis.
p83
aa(lp84
VBut the dropout crisis is just the tip of an iceberg.
p85
aVWhat it doesn't count are all the kids who are in school
p86
aVbut being disengaged from it, who don't enjoy it,
p87
aVwho don't get any real benefit from it.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd the reason is not that we're not spending enough money.
p90
aVAmerica spends more money on education than most other countries.
p91
aVClass sizes are smaller than in many countries.
p92
aVAnd there are hundreds of initiatives every year
p93
aVto try and improve education.
p94
aVThe trouble is, it's all going in the wrong direction.
p95
aVThere are three principles on which human life flourishes,
p96
aVand they are contradicted by the culture of education
p97
aVunder which most teachers have to labor
p98
aVand most students have to endure.
p99
aa(lp100
VThe first is this, that human beings are naturally different and diverse.
p101
aVCan I ask you, how many of you have got children of your own?
p102
aVOkay. Or grandchildren.
p103
aVHow about two children or more? Right.
p104
aVAnd the rest of you have seen such children.
p105
aa(lp106
V(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
VSmall people wandering about.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VI will make you a bet,
p113
aVand I am confident that I will win the bet.
p114
aVIf you've got two children or more,
p115
aVI bet you they are completely different from each other.
p116
aVAren't they?
p117
aa(lp118
V(Applause)
p119
aa(lp120
VYou would never confuse them, would you?
p121
aVLike, "Which one are you? Remind me."
p122
aa(lp123
V(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
V"Your mother and I need some color-coding system
p126
aVso we don't get confused."
p127
aa(lp128
VEducation under "No Child Left Behind"
p129
aVis based on not diversity but conformity.
p130
aVWhat schools are encouraged to do is to find out
p131
aVwhat kids can do across a very narrow spectrum of achievement.
p132
aVOne of the effects of "No Child Left Behind"
p133
aVhas been to narrow the focus onto the so-called STEM disciplines.
p134
aVThey're very important.
p135
aVI'm not here to argue against science and math.
p136
aVOn the contrary, they're necessary but they're not sufficient.
p137
aVA real education has to give equal weight
p138
aVto the arts, the humanities, to physical education.
p139
aVAn awful lot of kids, sorry, thank you \u2014
p140
aa(lp141
V(Applause)
p142
aa(lp143
VOne estimate in America currently is that something like 10 percent of kids,
p144
aVgetting on that way,
p145
aVare being diagnosed with various conditions
p146
aVunder the broad title of attention deficit disorder.
p147
aVADHD.
p148
aVI'm not saying there's no such thing.
p149
aVI just don't believe it's an epidemic like this.
p150
aVIf you sit kids down, hour after hour,
p151
aVdoing low-grade clerical work,
p152
aVdon't be surprised if they start to fidget, you know?
p153
aa(lp154
V(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
V(Applause)
p157
aa(lp158
VChildren are not, for the most part, suffering from a psychological condition.
p159
aVThey're suffering from childhood.
p160
aa(lp161
V(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd I know this because I spent my early life as a child.
p164
aVI went through the whole thing.
p165
aVKids prosper best with a broad curriculum that celebrates their various talents,
p166
aVnot just a small range of them.
p167
aVAnd by the way, the arts aren't just important
p168
aVbecause they improve math scores.
p169
aVThey're important because they speak to parts of children's being
p170
aVwhich are otherwise untouched.
p171
aa(lp172
VThe second, thank you \u2014
p173
aa(lp174
V(Applause)
p175
aa(lp176
VThe second principle that drives human life flourishing
p177
aVis curiosity.
p178
aVIf you can light the spark of curiosity in a child,
p179
aVthey will learn without any further assistance, very often.
p180
aVChildren are natural learners.
p181
aVIt's a real achievement to put that particular ability out,
p182
aVor to stifle it.
p183
aVCuriosity is the engine of achievement.
p184
aVNow the reason I say this
p185
aVis because one of the effects of the current culture here,
p186
aVif I can say so,
p187
aVhas been to de-professionalize teachers.
p188
aVThere is no system in the world or any school in the country
p189
aVthat is better than its teachers.
p190
aVTeachers are the lifeblood of the success of schools.
p191
aVBut teaching is a creative profession.
p192
aVTeaching, properly conceived, is not a delivery system.
p193
aVYou know, you're not there just to pass on received information.
p194
aVGreat teachers do that,
p195
aVbut what great teachers also do is mentor,
p196
aVstimulate, provoke, engage.
p197
aVYou see, in the end, education is about learning.
p198
aVIf there's no learning going on, there's no education going on.
p199
aVAnd people can spend an awful lot of time
p200
aVdiscussing education without ever discussing learning.
p201
aVThe whole point of education is to get people to learn.
p202
aa(lp203
VAn old friend of mine \u2014 actually very old, he's dead.
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VThat's as old as it gets, I'm afraid.
p208
aa(lp209
V(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
VBut a wonderful guy he was, wonderful philosopher.
p212
aVHe used to talk about the difference
p213
aVbetween the task and achievement senses of verbs.
p214
aVYou can be engaged in the activity of something,
p215
aVbut not really be achieving it, like dieting.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VIt's a very good example.
p220
aVThere he is. He's dieting.
p221
aVIs he losing any weight? Not really.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VTeaching is a word like that.
p226
aVYou can say, "There's Deborah, she's in room 34, she's teaching."
p227
aVBut if nobody's learning anything,
p228
aVshe may be engaged in the task of teaching but not actually fulfilling it.
p229
aa(lp230
VThe role of a teacher is to facilitate learning.
p231
aVThat's it.
p232
aVAnd part of the problem is, I think,
p233
aVthat the dominant culture of education has come to focus
p234
aVon not teaching and learning, but testing.
p235
aVNow, testing is important.
p236
aVStandardized tests have a place.
p237
aVBut they should not be the dominant culture of education.
p238
aVThey should be diagnostic. They should help.
p239
aa(lp240
V(Applause)
p241
aa(lp242
VIf I go for a medical examination, I want some standardized tests.
p243
aVI do.
p244
aVI want to know what my cholesterol level is
p245
aVcompared to everybody else's on a standard scale.
p246
aVI don't want to be told on some scale my doctor invented in the car.
p247
aa(lp248
V(Laughter)
p249
aa(lp250
V"Your cholesterol is what I call Level Orange."
p251
aa(lp252
V"Really?"
p253
aa(lp254
V(Laughter)
p255
aa(lp256
V"Is that good?" "We don't know."
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
VBut all that should support learning.
p261
aVIt shouldn't obstruct it, which of course it often does.
p262
aVSo in place of curiosity, what we have is a culture of compliance.
p263
aVOur children and teachers are encouraged to follow routine algorithms
p264
aVrather than to excite that power of imagination and curiosity.
p265
aVAnd the third principle is this: that human life is inherently creative.
p266
aVIt's why we all have different résumés.
p267
aVWe create our lives,
p268
aVand we can recreate them as we go through them.
p269
aVIt's the common currency of being a human being.
p270
aVIt's why human culture is so interesting and diverse and dynamic.
p271
aVI mean, other animals may well have imaginations and creativity,
p272
aVbut it's not so much in evidence, is it, as ours?
p273
aVI mean, you may have a dog.
p274
aVAnd your dog may get depressed.
p275
aVYou know, but it doesn't listen to Radiohead, does it?
p276
aa(lp277
V(Laughter)
p278
aa(lp279
VAnd sit staring out the window with a bottle of Jack Daniels.
p280
aa(lp281
V(Laughter)
p282
aa(lp283
V"Would you like to come for a walk?"
p284
aV"No, I'm fine."
p285
aa(lp286
V(Laughter)
p287
aa(lp288
V"You go. I'll wait. But take pictures."
p289
aa(lp290
V(Laughter)
p291
aa(lp292
VWe all create our own lives through this restless process
p293
aVof imagining alternatives and possibilities,
p294
aVand one of the roles of education
p295
aVis to awaken and develop these powers of creativity.
p296
aVInstead, what we have is a culture of standardization.
p297
aa(lp298
VNow, it doesn't have to be that way.
p299
aVIt really doesn't.
p300
aVFinland regularly comes out on top in math, science and reading.
p301
aVNow, we only know that's what they do well at,
p302
aVbecause that's all that's being tested.
p303
aVThat's one of the problems of the test.
p304
aVThey don't look for other things that matter just as much.
p305
aVThe thing about work in Finland is this:
p306
aVthey don't obsess about those disciplines.
p307
aVThey have a very broad approach to education,
p308
aVwhich includes humanities, physical education, the arts.
p309
aa(lp310
VSecond, there is no standardized testing in Finland.
p311
aVI mean, there's a bit,
p312
aVbut it's not what gets people up in the morning,
p313
aVwhat keeps them at their desks.
p314
aa(lp315
VThe third thing \u2014 and I was at a meeting recently
p316
aVwith some people from Finland, actual Finnish people,
p317
aVand somebody from the American system was saying to the people in Finland,
p318
aV"What do you do about the drop-out rate in Finland?"
p319
aa(lp320
VAnd they all looked a bit bemused, and said,
p321
aV"Well, we don't have one.
p322
aVWhy would you drop out?
p323
aVIf people are in trouble, we get to them quite quickly
p324
aVand we help and support them."
p325
aa(lp326
VNow people always say,
p327
aV"Well, you know, you can't compare Finland to America."
p328
aVNo. I think there's a population of around five million in Finland.
p329
aVBut you can compare it to a state in America.
p330
aVMany states in America have fewer people in them than that.
p331
aVI mean, I've been to some states in America
p332
aVand I was the only person there.
p333
aa(lp334
V(Laughter)
p335
aa(lp336
VReally. Really.
p337
aVI was asked to lock up when I left.
p338
aa(lp339
V(Laughter)
p340
aa(lp341
VBut what all the high-performing systems in the world do
p342
aVis currently what is not evident, sadly,
p343
aVacross the systems in America \u2014
p344
aVI mean, as a whole.
p345
aVOne is this:
p346
aVthey individualize teaching and learning.
p347
aVThey recognize that it's students who are learning
p348
aVand the system has to engage them,
p349
aVtheir curiosity, their individuality, and their creativity.
p350
aVThat's how you get them to learn.
p351
aa(lp352
VThe second is that they attribute a very high status
p353
aVto the teaching profession.
p354
aVThey recognize that you can't improve education
p355
aVif you don't pick great people to teach and keep giving them
p356
aVconstant support and professional development.
p357
aVInvesting in professional development is not a cost.
p358
aVIt's an investment,
p359
aVand every other country that's succeeding well knows that,
p360
aVwhether it's Australia, Canada,
p361
aVSouth Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong or Shanghai.
p362
aVThey know that to be the case.
p363
aa(lp364
VAnd the third is,
p365
aVthey devolve responsibility to the school level
p366
aVfor getting the job done.
p367
aVYou see, there's a big difference here
p368
aVbetween going into a mode of command and control in education \u2014
p369
aVThat's what happens in some systems.
p370
aVCentral or state governments decide,
p371
aVthey know best and they're going to tell you what to do.
p372
aVThe trouble is that education doesn't go on
p373
aVin the committee rooms of our legislative buildings.
p374
aVIt happens in classrooms and schools,
p375
aVand the people who do it are the teachers and the students,
p376
aVand if you remove their discretion, it stops working.
p377
aVYou have to put it back to the people.
p378
aa(lp379
V(Applause)
p380
aa(lp381
VThere is wonderful work happening in this country.
p382
aVBut I have to say it's happening
p383
aVin spite of the dominant culture of education,
p384
aVnot because of it.
p385
aVIt's like people are sailing into a headwind all the time.
p386
aVAnd the reason I think is this:
p387
aVthat many of the current policies
p388
aVare based on mechanistic conceptions of education.
p389
aVIt's like education is an industrial process
p390
aVthat can be improved just by having better data,
p391
aVand somewhere in the back of the mind of some policy makers
p392
aVis this idea that if we fine-tune it well enough, if we just get it right,
p393
aVit will all hum along perfectly into the future.
p394
aVIt won't, and it never did.
p395
aa(lp396
VThe point is that education is not a mechanical system.
p397
aVIt's a human system.
p398
aVIt's about people,
p399
aVpeople who either do want to learn or don't want to learn.
p400
aVEvery student who drops out of school has a reason for it
p401
aVwhich is rooted in their own biography.
p402
aVThey may find it boring.
p403
aVThey may find it irrelevant.
p404
aVThey may find that it's at odds with the life they're living outside of school.
p405
aVThere are trends, but the stories are always unique.
p406
aVI was at a meeting recently in Los Angeles of \u2014
p407
aVthey're called alternative education programs.
p408
aVThese are programs designed to get kids back into education.
p409
aVThey have certain common features.
p410
aVThey're very personalized.
p411
aVThey have strong support for the teachers,
p412
aVclose links with the community and a broad and diverse curriculum,
p413
aVand often programs which involve students outside school as well as inside school.
p414
aVAnd they work.
p415
aVWhat's interesting to me is, these are called "alternative education."
p416
aa(lp417
V(Laughter)
p418
aa(lp419
VYou know?
p420
aVAnd all the evidence from around the world is,
p421
aVif we all did that, there'd be no need for the alternative.
p422
aa(lp423
V(Applause)
p424
aa(lp425
V(Applause ends)
p426
aa(lp427
VSo I think we have to embrace a different metaphor.
p428
aVWe have to recognize that it's a human system,
p429
aVand there are conditions under which people thrive,
p430
aVand conditions under which they don't.
p431
aVWe are after all organic creatures,
p432
aVand the culture of the school is absolutely essential.
p433
aVCulture is an organic term, isn't it?
p434
aa(lp435
VNot far from where I live is a place called Death Valley.
p436
aVDeath Valley is the hottest, driest place in America,
p437
aVand nothing grows there.
p438
aVNothing grows there because it doesn't rain.
p439
aVHence, Death Valley.
p440
aVIn the winter of 2004, it rained in Death Valley.
p441
aVSeven inches of rain fell over a very short period.
p442
aVAnd in the spring of 2005, there was a phenomenon.
p443
aVThe whole floor of Death Valley was carpeted in flowers for a while.
p444
aVWhat it proved is this:
p445
aVthat Death Valley isn't dead.
p446
aVIt's dormant.
p447
aVRight beneath the surface are these seeds of possibility
p448
aVwaiting for the right conditions to come about,
p449
aVand with organic systems, if the conditions are right,
p450
aVlife is inevitable.
p451
aVIt happens all the time.
p452
aVYou take an area, a school, a district,
p453
aVyou change the conditions, give people a different sense of possibility,
p454
aVa different set of expectations, a broader range of opportunities,
p455
aVyou cherish and value the relationships between teachers and learners,
p456
aVyou offer people the discretion to be creative
p457
aVand to innovate in what they do,
p458
aVand schools that were once bereft spring to life.
p459
aa(lp460
VGreat leaders know that.
p461
aVThe real role of leadership in education \u2014
p462
aVand I think it's true at the national level,
p463
aVthe state level, at the school level \u2014
p464
aVis not and should not be command and control.
p465
aVThe real role of leadership is climate control,
p466
aVcreating a climate of possibility.
p467
aVAnd if you do that, people will rise to it
p468
aVand achieve things that you completely did not anticipate
p469
aVand couldn't have expected.
p470
aa(lp471
VThere's a wonderful quote from Benjamin Franklin.
p472
aV"There are three sorts of people in the world:
p473
aVThose who are immovable,
p474
aVpeople who don't get it,
p475
aVor don't want to do anything about it;
p476
aVthere are people who are movable,
p477
aVpeople who see the need for change
p478
aVand are prepared to listen to it;
p479
aVand there are people who move,
p480
aVpeople who make things happen."
p481
aVAnd if we can encourage more people, that will be a movement.
p482
aVAnd if the movement is strong enough,
p483
aVthat's, in the best sense of the word, a revolution.
p484
aVAnd that's what we need.
p485
aa(lp486
VThank you very much.
p487
aa(lp488
V(Applause)
p489
aa(lp490
VThank you very much.

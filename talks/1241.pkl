VWhat is going on
p5
aVin this baby's mind?
p6
aVIf you'd asked people this 30 years ago,
p7
aVmost people, including psychologists,
p8
aVwould have said that this baby was irrational,
p9
aVillogical, egocentric \u2014
p10
aVthat he couldn't take the perspective of another person
p11
aVor understand cause and effect.
p12
aVIn the last 20 years,
p13
aVdevelopmental science has completely overturned that picture.
p14
aVSo in some ways,
p15
aVwe think that this baby's thinking
p16
aVis like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists.
p17
aa(lp18
VLet me give you just one example of this.
p19
aVOne thing that this baby could be thinking about,
p20
aVthat could be going on in his mind,
p21
aVis trying to figure out
p22
aVwhat's going on in the mind of that other baby.
p23
aVAfter all, one of the things that's hardest for all of us to do
p24
aVis to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling.
p25
aVAnd maybe the hardest thing of all
p26
aVis to figure out that what other people think and feel
p27
aVisn't actually exactly like what we think and feel.
p28
aVAnyone who's followed politics can testify
p29
aVto how hard that is for some people to get.
p30
aVWe wanted to know
p31
aVif babies and young children
p32
aVcould understand this really profound thing about other people.
p33
aVNow the question is: How could we ask them?
p34
aVBabies, after all, can't talk,
p35
aVand if you ask a three year-old
p36
aVto tell you what he thinks,
p37
aVwhat you'll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue
p38
aVabout ponies and birthdays and things like that.
p39
aVSo how do we actually ask them the question?
p40
aa(lp41
VWell it turns out that the secret was broccoli.
p42
aVWhat we did \u2014 Betty Rapacholi, who was one of my students, and I \u2014
p43
aVwas actually to give the babies two bowls of food:
p44
aVone bowl of raw broccoli
p45
aVand one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers.
p46
aVNow all of the babies, even in Berkley,
p47
aVlike the crackers and don't like the raw broccoli.
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aVBut then what Betty did
p50
aVwas to take a little taste of food from each bowl.
p51
aVAnd she would act as if she liked it or she didn't.
p52
aVSo half the time, she acted
p53
aVas if she liked the crackers and didn't like the broccoli \u2014
p54
aVjust like a baby and any other sane person.
p55
aVBut half the time,
p56
aVwhat she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli
p57
aVand go, "Mmmmm, broccoli.
p58
aVI tasted the broccoli. Mmmmm."
p59
aVAnd then she would take a little bit of the crackers,
p60
aVand she'd go, "Eww, yuck, crackers.
p61
aVI tasted the crackers. Eww, yuck."
p62
aVSo she'd act as if what she wanted
p63
aVwas just the opposite of what the babies wanted.
p64
aVWe did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies.
p65
aVAnd then she would simply put her hand out and say,
p66
aV"Can you give me some?"
p67
aa(lp68
VSo the question is: What would the baby give her,
p69
aVwhat they liked or what she liked?
p70
aVAnd the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies,
p71
aVjust barely walking and talking,
p72
aVwould give her the crackers if she liked the crackers,
p73
aVbut they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli.
p74
aVOn the other hand,
p75
aV15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time
p76
aVif she acted as if she liked the broccoli,
p77
aVlike they couldn't figure this out.
p78
aVBut then after they stared for a long time,
p79
aVthey would just give her the crackers,
p80
aVwhat they thought everybody must like.
p81
aVSo there are two really remarkable things about this.
p82
aVThe first one is that these little 18 month-old babies
p83
aVhave already discovered
p84
aVthis really profound fact about human nature,
p85
aVthat we don't always want the same thing.
p86
aVAnd what's more, they felt that they should actually do things
p87
aVto help other people get what they wanted.
p88
aa(lp89
VEven more remarkably though,
p90
aVthe fact that 15 month-olds didn't do this
p91
aVsuggests that these 18 month-olds had learned
p92
aVthis deep, profound fact about human nature
p93
aVin the three months from when they were 15 months old.
p94
aVSo children both know more and learn more
p95
aVthan we ever would have thought.
p96
aVAnd this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years
p97
aVthat's actually demonstrated it.
p98
aa(lp99
VThe question you might ask though is:
p100
aVWhy do children learn so much?
p101
aVAnd how is it possible for them to learn so much
p102
aVin such a short time?
p103
aVI mean, after all, if you look at babies superficially,
p104
aVthey seem pretty useless.
p105
aVAnd actually in many ways, they're worse than useless,
p106
aVbecause we have to put so much time and energy
p107
aVinto just keeping them alive.
p108
aVBut if we turn to evolution
p109
aVfor an answer to this puzzle
p110
aVof why we spend so much time
p111
aVtaking care of useless babies,
p112
aVit turns out that there's actually an answer.
p113
aVIf we look across many, many different species of animals,
p114
aVnot just us primates,
p115
aVbut also including other mammals, birds,
p116
aVeven marsupials
p117
aVlike kangaroos and wombats,
p118
aVit turns out that there's a relationship
p119
aVbetween how long a childhood a species has
p120
aVand how big their brains are compared to their bodies
p121
aVand how smart and flexible they are.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there.
p124
aVOn one side
p125
aVis a New Caledonian crow.
p126
aVAnd crows and other corvidae, ravens, rooks and so forth,
p127
aVare incredibly smart birds.
p128
aVThey're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects.
p129
aVAnd this is a bird on the cover of science
p130
aVwho's learned how to use a tool to get food.
p131
aVOn the other hand,
p132
aVwe have our friend the domestic chicken.
p133
aVAnd chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys
p134
aVare basically as dumb as dumps.
p135
aVSo they're very, very good at pecking for grain,
p136
aVand they're not much good at doing anything else.
p137
aVWell it turns out that the babies,
p138
aVthe New Caledonian crow babies, are fledglings.
p139
aVThey depend on their moms
p140
aVto drop worms in their little open mouths
p141
aVfor as long as two years,
p142
aVwhich is a really long time in the life of a bird.
p143
aVWhereas the chickens are actually mature
p144
aVwithin a couple of months.
p145
aVSo childhood is the reason
p146
aVwhy the crows end up on the cover of Science
p147
aVand the chickens end up in the soup pot.
p148
aa(lp149
VThere's something about that long childhood
p150
aVthat seems to be connected
p151
aVto knowledge and learning.
p152
aVWell what kind of explanation could we have for this?
p153
aVWell some animals, like the chicken,
p154
aVseem to be beautifully suited
p155
aVto doing just one thing very well.
p156
aVSo they seem to be beautifully suited
p157
aVto pecking grain in one environment.
p158
aVOther creatures, like the crows,
p159
aVaren't very good at doing anything in particular,
p160
aVbut they're extremely good
p161
aVat learning about laws of different environments.
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd of course, we human beings
p164
aVare way out on the end of the distribution like the crows.
p165
aVWe have bigger brains relative to our bodies
p166
aVby far than any other animal.
p167
aVWe're smarter, we're more flexible,
p168
aVwe can learn more,
p169
aVwe survive in more different environments,
p170
aVwe migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space.
p171
aVAnd our babies and children are dependent on us
p172
aVfor much longer than the babies of any other species.
p173
aVMy son is 23.
p174
aV(Laughter)
p175
aVAnd at least until they're 23,
p176
aVwe're still popping those worms
p177
aVinto those little open mouths.
p178
aa(lp179
VAll right, why would we see this correlation?
p180
aVWell an idea is that that strategy, that learning strategy,
p181
aVis an extremely powerful, great strategy for getting on in the world,
p182
aVbut it has one big disadvantage.
p183
aVAnd that one big disadvantage
p184
aVis that, until you actually do all that learning,
p185
aVyou're going to be helpless.
p186
aVSo you don't want to have the mastodon charging at you
p187
aVand be saying to yourself,
p188
aV"A slingshot or maybe a spear might work. Which would actually be better?"
p189
aVYou want to know all that
p190
aVbefore the mastodons actually show up.
p191
aVAnd the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem
p192
aVis with a kind of division of labor.
p193
aVSo the idea is that we have this early period when we're completely protected.
p194
aVWe don't have to do anything. All we have to do is learn.
p195
aVAnd then as adults,
p196
aVwe can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children
p197
aVand actually put them to work to do things out there in the world.
p198
aa(lp199
VSo one way of thinking about it
p200
aVis that babies and young children
p201
aVare like the research and development division of the human species.
p202
aVSo they're the protected blue sky guys
p203
aVwho just have to go out and learn and have good ideas,
p204
aVand we're production and marketing.
p205
aVWe have to take all those ideas
p206
aVthat we learned when we were children
p207
aVand actually put them to use.
p208
aVAnother way of thinking about it
p209
aVis instead of thinking of babies and children
p210
aVas being like defective grownups,
p211
aVwe should think about them
p212
aVas being a different developmental stage of the same species \u2014
p213
aVkind of like caterpillars and butterflies \u2014
p214
aVexcept that they're actually the brilliant butterflies
p215
aVwho are flitting around the garden and exploring,
p216
aVand we're the caterpillars
p217
aVwho are inching along our narrow, grownup, adult path.
p218
aa(lp219
VIf this is true, if these babies are designed to learn \u2014
p220
aVand this evolutionary story would say children are for learning,
p221
aVthat's what they're for \u2014
p222
aVwe might expect
p223
aVthat they would have really powerful learning mechanisms.
p224
aVAnd in fact, the baby's brain
p225
aVseems to be the most powerful learning computer
p226
aVon the planet.
p227
aVBut real computers are actually getting to be a lot better.
p228
aVAnd there's been a revolution
p229
aVin our understanding of machine learning recently.
p230
aVAnd it all depends on the ideas of this guy,
p231
aVthe Reverend Thomas Bayes,
p232
aVwho was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century.
p233
aVAnd essentially what Bayes did
p234
aVwas to provide a mathematical way
p235
aVusing probability theory
p236
aVto characterize, describe,
p237
aVthe way that scientists find out about the world.
p238
aVSo what scientists do
p239
aVis they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with.
p240
aVThey go out and test it against the evidence.
p241
aVThe evidence makes them change that hypothesis.
p242
aVThen they test that new hypothesis
p243
aVand so on and so forth.
p244
aVAnd what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that.
p245
aVAnd that mathematics is at the core
p246
aVof the best machine learning programs that we have now.
p247
aVAnd some 10 years ago,
p248
aVI suggested that babies might be doing the same thing.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo if you want to know what's going on
p251
aVunderneath those beautiful brown eyes,
p252
aVI think it actually looks something like this.
p253
aVThis is Reverend Bayes's notebook.
p254
aVSo I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations
p255
aVwith conditional probabilities that they're revising
p256
aVto figure out how the world works.
p257
aVAll right, now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate.
p258
aVBecause after all, if you ask even grownups about statistics,
p259
aVthey look extremely stupid.
p260
aVHow could it be that children are doing statistics?
p261
aa(lp262
VSo to test this we used a machine that we have
p263
aVcalled the Blicket Detector.
p264
aVThis is a box that lights up and plays music
p265
aVwhen you put some things on it and not others.
p266
aVAnd using this very simple machine,
p267
aVmy lab and others have done dozens of studies
p268
aVshowing just how good babies are
p269
aVat learning about the world.
p270
aVLet me mention just one
p271
aVthat we did with Tumar Kushner, my student.
p272
aVIf I showed you this detector,
p273
aVyou would be likely to think to begin with
p274
aVthat the way to make the detector go
p275
aVwould be to put a block on top of the detector.
p276
aVBut actually, this detector
p277
aVworks in a bit of a strange way.
p278
aVBecause if you wave a block over the top of the detector,
p279
aVsomething you wouldn't ever think of to begin with,
p280
aVthe detector will actually activate two out of three times.
p281
aVWhereas, if you do the likely thing, put the block on the detector,
p282
aVit will only activate two out of six times.
p283
aVSo the unlikely hypothesis
p284
aVactually has stronger evidence.
p285
aVIt looks as if the waving
p286
aVis a more effective strategy than the other strategy.
p287
aVSo we did just this; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence,
p288
aVand we just asked them to make it go.
p289
aVAnd sure enough, the four year-olds used the evidence
p290
aVto wave the object on top of the detector.
p291
aa(lp292
VNow there are two things that are really interesting about this.
p293
aVThe first one is, again, remember, these are four year-olds.
p294
aVThey're just learning how to count.
p295
aVBut unconsciously,
p296
aVthey're doing these quite complicated calculations
p297
aVthat will give them a conditional probability measure.
p298
aVAnd the other interesting thing
p299
aVis that they're using that evidence
p300
aVto get to an idea, get to a hypothesis about the world,
p301
aVthat seems very unlikely to begin with.
p302
aVAnd in studies we've just been doing in my lab, similar studies,
p303
aVwe've show that four year-olds are actually better
p304
aVat finding out an unlikely hypothesis
p305
aVthan adults are when we give them exactly the same task.
p306
aVSo in these circumstances,
p307
aVthe children are using statistics to find out about the world,
p308
aVbut after all, scientists also do experiments,
p309
aVand we wanted to see if children are doing experiments.
p310
aVWhen children do experiments we call it "getting into everything"
p311
aVor else "playing."
p312
aa(lp313
VAnd there's been a bunch of interesting studies recently
p314
aVthat have shown this playing around
p315
aVis really a kind of experimental research program.
p316
aVHere's one from Cristine Legare's lab.
p317
aVWhat Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors.
p318
aVAnd what she did was show children
p319
aVthat yellow ones made it go and red ones didn't,
p320
aVand then she showed them an anomaly.
p321
aVAnd what you'll see
p322
aVis that this little boy will go through five hypotheses
p323
aVin the space of two minutes.
p324
aa(lp325
V(Video) Boy: How about this?
p326
aVSame as the other side.
p327
aa(lp328
VAlison Gopnik: Okay, so his first hypothesis has just been falsified.
p329
aa(lp330
V(Laughter)
p331
aa(lp332
VBoy: This one lighted up, and this one nothing.
p333
aa(lp334
VAG: Okay, he's got his experimental notebook out.
p335
aa(lp336
VBoy: What's making this light up.
p337
aV(Laughter)
p338
aVI don't know.
p339
aa(lp340
VAG: Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair.
p341
aa(lp342
V(Laughter)
p343
aa(lp344
VBoy: Oh, it's because this needs to be like this,
p345
aVand this needs to be like this.
p346
aa(lp347
VAG: Okay, hypothesis two.
p348
aa(lp349
VBoy: That's why.
p350
aVOh.
p351
aa(lp352
V(Laughter)
p353
aa(lp354
VAG: Now this is his next idea.
p355
aVHe told the experimenter to do this,
p356
aVto try putting it out onto the other location.
p357
aVNot working either.
p358
aa(lp359
VBoy: Oh, because the light goes only to here,
p360
aVnot here.
p361
aVOh, the bottom of this box
p362
aVhas electricity in here,
p363
aVbut this doesn't have electricity.
p364
aa(lp365
VAG: Okay, that's a fourth hypothesis.
p366
aa(lp367
VBoy: It's lighting up.
p368
aVSo when you put four.
p369
aVSo you put four on this one to make it light up
p370
aVand two on this one to make it light up.
p371
aa(lp372
VAG: Okay,there's his fifth hypothesis.
p373
aa(lp374
VNow that is a particularly \u2014
p375
aVthat is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy,
p376
aVbut what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical.
p377
aVIf you look at the way children play, when you ask them to explain something,
p378
aVwhat they really do is do a series of experiments.
p379
aVThis is actually pretty typical of four year-olds.
p380
aa(lp381
VWell, what's it like to be this kind of creature?
p382
aVWhat's it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies
p383
aVwho can test five hypotheses in two minutes?
p384
aVWell, if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers,
p385
aVa lot of them have said
p386
aVthat babies and young children were barely conscious
p387
aVif they were conscious at all.
p388
aVAnd I think just the opposite is true.
p389
aVI think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults.
p390
aVNow here's what we know about how adult consciousness works.
p391
aVAnd adults' attention and consciousness
p392
aVlook kind of like a spotlight.
p393
aVSo what happens for adults
p394
aVis we decide that something's relevant or important,
p395
aVwe should pay attention to it.
p396
aVOur consciousness of that thing that we're attending to
p397
aVbecomes extremely bright and vivid,
p398
aVand everything else sort of goes dark.
p399
aVAnd we even know something about the way the brain does this.
p400
aa(lp401
VSo what happens when we pay attention
p402
aVis that the prefrontal cortex, the sort of executive part of our brains,
p403
aVsends a signal
p404
aVthat makes a little part of our brain much more flexible,
p405
aVmore plastic, better at learning,
p406
aVand shuts down activity
p407
aVin all the rest of our brains.
p408
aVSo we have a very focused, purpose-driven kind of attention.
p409
aVIf we look at babies and young children,
p410
aVwe see something very different.
p411
aVI think babies and young children
p412
aVseem to have more of a lantern of consciousness
p413
aVthan a spotlight of consciousness.
p414
aVSo babies and young children are very bad
p415
aVat narrowing down to just one thing.
p416
aVBut they're very good at taking in lots of information
p417
aVfrom lots of different sources at once.
p418
aVAnd if you actually look in their brains,
p419
aVyou see that they're flooded with these neurotransmitters
p420
aVthat are really good at inducing learning and plasticity,
p421
aVand the inhibitory parts haven't come on yet.
p422
aVSo when we say that babies and young children
p423
aVare bad at paying attention,
p424
aVwhat we really mean is that they're bad at not paying attention.
p425
aVSo they're bad at getting rid
p426
aVof all the interesting things that could tell them something
p427
aVand just looking at the thing that's important.
p428
aVThat's the kind of attention, the kind of consciousness,
p429
aVthat we might expect
p430
aVfrom those butterflies who are designed to learn.
p431
aa(lp432
VWell if we want to think about a way
p433
aVof getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults,
p434
aVI think the best thing is think about cases
p435
aVwhere we're put in a new situation that we've never been in before \u2014
p436
aVwhen we fall in love with someone new,
p437
aVor when we're in a new city for the first time.
p438
aVAnd what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts,
p439
aVit expands,
p440
aVso that those three days in Paris
p441
aVseem to be more full of consciousness and experience
p442
aVthan all the months of being
p443
aVa walking, talking, faculty meeting-attending zombie back home.
p444
aVAnd by the way, that coffee,
p445
aVthat wonderful coffee you've been drinking downstairs,
p446
aVactually mimics the effect
p447
aVof those baby neurotransmitters.
p448
aVSo what's it like to be a baby?
p449
aVIt's like being in love
p450
aVin Paris for the first time
p451
aVafter you've had three double-espressos.
p452
aV(Laughter)
p453
aVThat's a fantastic way to be,
p454
aVbut it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o'clock in the morning.
p455
aa(lp456
V(Laughter)
p457
aa(lp458
VNow it's good to be a grownup.
p459
aVI don't want to say too much about how wonderful babies are.
p460
aVIt's good to be a grownup.
p461
aVWe can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves.
p462
aVAnd it makes sense that we put a lot of effort

aVinto making babies think like adults do.
p464
aVBut if what we want is to be like those butterflies,
p465
aVto have open-mindedness, open learning,
p466
aVimagination, creativity, innovation,
p467
aVmaybe at least some of the time
p468
aVwe should be getting the adults
p469
aVto start thinking more like children.

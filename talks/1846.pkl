VThroughout my career, I've been fortunate enough
p5
aVto work with many of the great
p6
aVinternational architects,
p7
aVdocumenting their work and observing
p8
aVhow their designs have the capacity
p9
aVto influence the cities in which they sit.
p10
aVI think of new cities like Dubai
p11
aVor ancient cities like Rome
p12
aVwith Zaha Hadid's incredible MAXXI museum,
p13
aVor like right here in New York with the High Line,
p14
aVa city which has been so much influenced
p15
aVby the development of this.
p16
aa(lp17
VBut what I find really fascinating
p18
aVis what happens when architects and planners leave
p19
aVand these places become appropriated by people,
p20
aVlike here in Chandigarh, India,
p21
aVthe city which has been completely designed
p22
aVby the architect Le Corbusier.
p23
aVNow 60 years later, the city has been taken over
p24
aVby people in very different ways
p25
aVfrom whatever perhaps intended for,
p26
aVlike here, where you have the people
p27
aVsitting in the windows of the assembly hall.
p28
aVBut over the course of several years,
p29
aVI've been documenting Rem Koolhaas's
p30
aVCCTV building in Beijing
p31
aVand the olympic stadium in the same city
p32
aVby the architects Herzog and de Meuron.
p33
aVAt these large-scale construction sites in China,
p34
aVyou see a sort of makeshift camp
p35
aVwhere workers live during the entire building process.
p36
aVAs the length of the construction takes years,
p37
aVworkers end up forming a rather rough-and-ready
p38
aVinformal city, making for quite a juxtaposition
p39
aVagainst the sophisticated structures that they're building.
p40
aa(lp41
VOver the past seven years, I've been following
p42
aVmy fascination with the built environment,
p43
aVand for those of you who know me, you would say
p44
aVthat this obsession has led me to live
p45
aVout of a suitcase 365 days a year.
p46
aVBeing constantly on the move
p47
aVmeans that sometimes I am able
p48
aVto catch life's most unpredictable moments,
p49
aVlike here in New York
p50
aVthe day after the Sandy storm hit the city.
p51
aa(lp52
VJust over three years ago,
p53
aVI was for the first time in Caracas, Venezuela,
p54
aVand while flying over the city, I was just amazed
p55
aVby the extent to which the slums
p56
aVreach into every corner of the city,
p57
aVa place where nearly 70 percent of the population
p58
aVlives in slums,
p59
aVdraped literally all over the mountains.
p60
aVDuring a conversation with local architects Urban-Think Tank,
p61
aVI learned about the Torre David,
p62
aVa 45-story office building which sits
p63
aVright in the center of Caracas.
p64
aVThe building was under construction
p65
aVuntil the collapse of the Venezuelan economy
p66
aVand the death of the developer in the early '90s.
p67
aVAbout eight years ago, people started moving
p68
aVinto the abandoned tower
p69
aVand began to build their homes right in between
p70
aVevery column of this unfinished tower.
p71
aVThere's only one little entrance to the entire building,
p72
aVand the 3,000 residents come in and out
p73
aVthrough that single door.
p74
aVTogether, the inhabitants created public spaces
p75
aVand designed them to feel more like a home
p76
aVand less like an unfinished tower.
p77
aVIn the lobby, they painted the walls and planted trees.
p78
aVThey also made a basketball court.
p79
aVBut when you look up closely,
p80
aVyou see massive holes where elevators
p81
aVand services would have run through.
p82
aa(lp83
VWithin the tower, people have come up
p84
aVwith all sorts of solutions
p85
aVin response to the various needs
p86
aVwhich arise from living in an unfinished tower.
p87
aVWith no elevators,
p88
aVthe tower is like a 45-story walkup.
p89
aVDesigned in very specific ways
p90
aVby this group of people
p91
aVwho haven't had any education in architecture or design.
p92
aVAnd with each inhabitant finding their own
p93
aVunique way of coming by,
p94
aVthis tower becomes like a living city,
p95
aVa place which is alive with micro-economies
p96
aVand small businesses.
p97
aVThe inventive inhabitants, for instance,
p98
aVfind opportunities in the most unexpected cases,
p99
aVlike the adjacent parking garage,
p100
aVwhich has been reclaimed as a taxi route
p101
aVto shuttle the inhabitants up through the ramps
p102
aVin order to shorten the hike
p103
aVup to the apartments.
p104
aa(lp105
VA walk through the tower
p106
aVreveals how residents have figured out
p107
aVhow to create walls, how to make an air flow,
p108
aVhow to create transparency,
p109
aVcirculation throughout the tower,
p110
aVessentially creating a home
p111
aVthat's completely adapted
p112
aVto the conditions of the site.
p113
aVWhen a new inhabitant moves into the tower,
p114
aVthey already have a roof over their head,
p115
aVso they just typically mark their space
p116
aVwith a few curtains or sheets.
p117
aVSlowly, from found materials, walls rise,
p118
aVand people create a space out of any found objects
p119
aVor materials.
p120
aa(lp121
VIt's remarkable to see the design decisions
p122
aVthat they're making,
p123
aVlike when everything is made out of red bricks,
p124
aVsome residents will cover that red brick
p125
aVwith another layer of red brick-patterned wallpaper
p126
aVjust to make it a kind of clean finish.
p127
aa(lp128
VThe inhabitants literally built up these homes
p129
aVwith their own hands, and this labor of love
p130
aVinstills a great sense of pride
p131
aVin many families living in this tower.
p132
aVThey typically make the best out of their conditions,
p133
aVand try to make their spaces look nice and homey,
p134
aVor at least up until as far as they can reach.
p135
aVThroughout the tower, you come across
p136
aVall kinds of services, like the barber,
p137
aVsmall factories, and every floor has
p138
aVa little grocery store or shop.
p139
aVAnd you even find a church.
p140
aVAnd on the 30th floor, there is a gym
p141
aVwhere all the weights and barbells
p142
aVare made out of the leftover pulleys
p143
aVfrom the elevators which were never installed.
p144
aVFrom the outside, behind this always-changing facade,
p145
aVyou see how the fixed concrete beams
p146
aVprovide a framework for the inhabitants
p147
aVto create their homes
p148
aVin an organic, intuitive way
p149
aVthat responds directly to their needs.
p150
aa(lp151
VLet's go now to Africa, to Nigeria,
p152
aVto a community called Makoko,
p153
aVa slum where 150,000 people
p154
aVlive just meters above the Lagos Lagoon.
p155
aVWhile it may appear to be a completely chaotic place,
p156
aVwhen you see it from above, there seems to be
p157
aVa whole grid of waterways and canals
p158
aVconnecting each and every home.
p159
aVFrom the main dock, people board long wooden canoes
p160
aVwhich carry them out to their various homes and shops
p161
aVlocated in the expansive area.
p162
aVWhen out on the water, it's clear
p163
aVthat life has been completely adapted
p164
aVto this very specific way of living.
p165
aVEven the canoes become variety stores
p166
aVwhere ladies paddle from house to house,
p167
aVselling anything from toothpaste to fresh fruits.
p168
aVBehind every window and door frame,
p169
aVyou'll see a small child peering back at you,
p170
aVand while Makoko seems to be packed with people,
p171
aVwhat's more shocking is actually
p172
aVthe amount of children pouring out of every building.
p173
aVThe population growth in Nigeria,
p174
aVand especially in these areas like Makoko,
p175
aVare painful reminders
p176
aVof how out of control things really are.
p177
aa(lp178
VIn Makoko, very few systems
p179
aVand infrastructures exist.
p180
aVElectricity is rigged and freshest water
p181
aVcomes from self-built wells throughout the area.
p182
aVThis entire economic model
p183
aVis designed to meet a specific way of living
p184
aVon the water, so fishing and boat-making
p185
aVare common professions.
p186
aVYou'll have a set of entrepreneurs
p187
aVwho have set up businesses throughout the area,
p188
aVlike barbershops, CD and DVD stores,
p189
aVmovie theaters, tailors, everything is there.
p190
aVThere is even a photo studio
p191
aVwhere you see the sort of aspiration
p192
aVto live in a real house or to be associated
p193
aVwith a faraway place, like that hotel in Sweden.
p194
aa(lp195
VOn this particular evening,
p196
aVI came across this live band
p197
aVdressed to the T in their coordinating outfits.
p198
aVThey were floating through the canals
p199
aVin a large canoe with a fitted-out generator
p200
aVfor all of the community to enjoy.
p201
aa(lp202
VBy nightfall, the area becomes almost pitch black,
p203
aVsave for a small lightbulb
p204
aVor a fire.
p205
aa(lp206
VWhat originally brought me to Makoko
p207
aVwas this project from a friend of mine,
p208
aVKunlé Adeyemi, who recently finished building
p209
aVthis three-story floating school
p210
aVfor the kids in Makoko.
p211
aVWith this entire village existing on the water,
p212
aVpublic space is very limited,
p213
aVso now that the school is finished,
p214
aVthe ground floor is a playground for the kids,
p215
aVbut when classes are out, the platform
p216
aVis just like a town square,
p217
aVwhere the fishermen mend their nets
p218
aVand floating shopkeepers dock their boats.
p219
aa(lp220
VAnother place I'd like to share with you
p221
aVis the Zabbaleen in Cairo.
p222
aVThey're descendants of farmers who began migrating
p223
aVfrom the upper Egypt in the '40s,
p224
aVand today they make their living
p225
aVby collecting and recycling waste from homes
p226
aVfrom all over Cairo.
p227
aVFor years, the Zabbaleen would live in makeshift villages
p228
aVwhere they would move around
p229
aVtrying to avoid the local authorities,
p230
aVbut in the early 1980s, they settled
p231
aVon the Mokattam rocks
p232
aVjust at the eastern edge of the city.
p233
aVToday, they live in this area,
p234
aVapproximately 50,000 to 70,000 people,
p235
aVwho live in this community of self-built
p236
aVmulti-story houses
p237
aVwhere up to three generations live in one structure.
p238
aVWhile these apartments that they built for themselves
p239
aVappear to lack any planning or formal grid,
p240
aVeach family specializing in a certain form of recycling
p241
aVmeans that the ground floor of each apartment
p242
aVis reserved for garbage-related activities
p243
aVand the upper floor is dedicated to living space.
p244
aVI find it incredible to see
p245
aVhow these piles and piles of garbage
p246
aVare invisible to the people who live there,
p247
aVlike this very distinguished man who is posing
p248
aVwhile all this garbage is sort of streaming out behind him,
p249
aVor like these two young men who are sitting
p250
aVand chatting amongst these tons of garbage.
p251
aVWhile to most of us, living amongst
p252
aVthese piles and piles of garbage
p253
aVmay seem totally uninhabitable,
p254
aVto those in the Zabbaleen, this is just
p255
aVa different type of normal.
p256
aVIn all these places I've talked about today,
p257
aVwhat I do find fascinating is that there's really
p258
aVno such thing as normal,
p259
aVand it proves that people are able to adapt
p260
aVto any kind of situation.
p261
aVThroughout the day, it's quite common
p262
aVto come across a small party taking place
p263
aVin the streets, just like this engagement party.
p264
aVIn this tradition, the bride-to-be
p265
aVdisplays all of their belongings,
p266
aVwhich they soon bring to their new husband.
p267
aVA gathering like this one
p268
aVoffers such a juxtaposition
p269
aVwhere all the new stuff is displayed
p270
aVand all the garbage is used
p271
aVas props to display all their new home accessories.
p272
aVLike Makoko and the Torre David,
p273
aVthroughout the Zabbaleen you'll find all
p274
aVthe same facilities as in any typical neighborhood.
p275
aVThere are the retail shops, the cafes
p276
aVand the restaurants, and the community
p277
aVis this community of Coptic Christians,
p278
aVso you'll also find a church,
p279
aValong with the scores of religious iconographies
p280
aVthroughout the area,
p281
aVand also all the everyday services
p282
aVlike the electronic repair shops,
p283
aVthe barbers, everything.
p284
aa(lp285
VVisiting the homes of the Zabbaleen
p286
aVis also full of surprises.
p287
aVWhile from the outside,
p288
aVthese homes look like any other informal structure
p289
aVin the city, when you step inside,
p290
aVyou are met with all manner of design decisions
p291
aVand interior decoration.
p292
aVDespite having limited access to space and money,
p293
aVthe homes in the area are designed
p294
aVwith care and detail.
p295
aVEvery apartment is unique,
p296
aVand this individuality tells a story
p297
aVabout each family's circumstances and values.
p298
aVMany of these people take their homes
p299
aVand interior spaces very seriously,
p300
aVputting a lot of work and care
p301
aVinto the details.
p302
aVThe shared spaces are also treated in the same manner,
p303
aVwhere walls are decorated in faux marble patterns.
p304
aa(lp305
VBut despite this elaborate decor,
p306
aVsometimes these apartments are used
p307
aVin very unexpected ways,
p308
aVlike this home which caught my attention
p309
aVwhile all the mud and the grass was literally
p310
aVseeping out under the front door.
p311
aVWhen I was let in, it appeared that this fifth-floor apartment
p312
aVwas being transformed into a complete animal farm,
p313
aVwhere six or seven cows stood grazing
p314
aVin what otherwise would be the living room.
p315
aVBut then in the apartment across the hall
p316
aVfrom this cow shed lives a newly married couple
p317
aVin what locals describe
p318
aVas one of the nicest apartments in the area.
p319
aa(lp320
VThe attention to this detail astonished me,
p321
aVand as the owner of the home so proudly
p322
aVled me around this apartment,
p323
aVfrom floor to ceiling, every part was decorated.
p324
aVBut if it weren't for the strangely familiar
p325
aVstomach-churning odor that constantly
p326
aVpasses through the apartment,
p327
aVit would be easy to forget
p328
aVthat you are standing next to a cow shed
p329
aVand on top of a landfill.
p330
aVWhat moved me the most was that despite
p331
aVthese seemingly inhospitable conditions,
p332
aVI was welcomed with open arms
p333
aVinto a home that was made with love, care,
p334
aVand unreserved passion.
p335
aa(lp336
VLet's move across the map to China,
p337
aVto an area called Shanxi, Henan and Gansu.
p338
aVIn a region famous for the soft, porous Loess Plateau soil,
p339
aVthere lived until recently an estimated
p340
aV40 million people in these houses underground.
p341
aVThese dwellings are called the yaodongs.
p342
aVThrough this architecture by subtraction,
p343
aVthese yaodongs are built literally inside of the soil.
p344
aVIn these villages, you see an entirely altered landscape,
p345
aVand hidden behind these mounds of dirt
p346
aVare these square, rectangular houses
p347
aVwhich sit seven meters below the ground.
p348
aVWhen I asked people why they were digging
p349
aVtheir houses from the ground,
p350
aVthey simply replied that they are poor wheat
p351
aVand apple farmers who didn't have the money
p352
aVto buy materials, and this digging out
p353
aVwas their most logical form of living.
p354
aa(lp355
VFrom Makoko to Zabbaleen, these communities
p356
aVhave approached the tasks of planning,
p357
aVdesign and management of their communities
p358
aVand neighborhoods in ways that respond
p359
aVspecifically to their environment and circumstances.
p360
aVCreated by these very people who live,
p361
aVwork and play in these particular spaces,
p362
aVthese neighborhoods are intuitively designed
p363
aVto make the most of their circumstances.
p364
aVIn most of these places, the government
p365
aVis completely absent, leaving inhabitants
p366
aVwith no choice but to reappropriate found materials,
p367
aVand while these communities are highly disadvantaged,
p368
aVthey do present examples
p369
aVof brilliant forms of ingenuity,
p370
aVand prove that indeed we have the ability
p371
aVto adapt to all manner of circumstances.
p372
aVWhat makes places like the Torre David
p373
aVparticularly remarkable
p374
aVis this sort of skeleton framework
p375
aVwhere people can have a foundation
p376
aVwhere they can tap into.
p377
aVNow imagine what these already ingenious communities
p378
aVcould create themselves,
p379
aVand how highly particular their solutions would be,
p380
aVif they were given the basic infrastructures
p381
aVthat they could tap into.
p382
aa(lp383
VToday, you see these large residential development projects
p384
aVwhich offer cookie-cutter housing solutions
p385
aVto massive amounts of people.
p386
aVFrom China to Brazil, these projects attempt
p387
aVto provide as many houses as possible,
p388
aVbut they're completely generic
p389
aVand simply do not work as an answer
p390
aVto the individual needs of the people.
p391
aa(lp392
VI would like to end with a quote
p393
aVfrom a friend of mine and a source of inspiration,
p394
aVZita Cobb, the founder of the wonderful
p395
aVShorefast Foundation,
p396
aVbased out of Fogo Island, Newfoundland.
p397
aVShe says that "there's this plague of sameness
p398
aVwhich is killing the human joy,"
p399
aVand I couldn't agree with her more.
p400
aa(lp401
VThank you.

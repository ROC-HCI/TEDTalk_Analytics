VIn the 17th century, a woman named Giulia Tofana
p5
aVhad a very successful perfume business.
p6
aVFor over 50 years she ran it.
p7
aVIt sort of ended abruptly when she was executed \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p8
aVfor murdering 600 men. You see, it wasn't a very good perfume.
p9
aVIn fact, it was completely odorless and tasteless and colorless,
p10
aVbut as a poison, it was the best money could buy,
p11
aVso women flocked to her in order to murder their husbands.
p12
aa(lp13
VIt turns out that poisoners were a valued and feared group,
p14
aVbecause poisoning a human being is a quite difficult thing.
p15
aVThe reason is, we have sort of a built-in poison detector.
p16
aVYou can see this as early as even in newborn infants.
p17
aVIf you are willing to do this, you can take a couple of drops
p18
aVof a bitter substance or a sour substance,
p19
aVand you'll see that face, the tongue stick out, the wrinkled nose,
p20
aVas if they're trying to get rid of what's in their mouth.
p21
aVThis reaction expands into adulthood and becomes
p22
aVsort of a full-blown disgust response, no longer just
p23
aVabout whether or not we're about to be poisoned,
p24
aVbut whenever there's a threat of physical contamination
p25
aVfrom some source. But the face remains strikingly similar.
p26
aVIt has expanded more, though, than just keeping us away
p27
aVfrom physical contaminants, and there's a growing
p28
aVbody of evidence to suggest that, in fact, this emotion
p29
aVof disgust now influences our moral beliefs
p30
aVand even our deeply held political intuitions.
p31
aa(lp32
VWhy this might be the case?
p33
aVWe can understand this process by understanding
p34
aVa little bit about emotions in general. So the basic human emotions,
p35
aVthose kinds of emotions that we share with all other human beings,
p36
aVexist because they motivate us to do good things
p37
aVand they keep us away from doing bad things.
p38
aVSo by and large, they are good for our survival.
p39
aVTake the emotion of fear, for instance. It keeps us away
p40
aVfrom doing things that are really, really risky.
p41
aVThis photo taken just before his death \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p42
aVis actually a \u2014 No, one reason this photo is interesting
p43
aVis because most people would not do this, and if they did,
p44
aVthey would not live to tell it, because fear would have
p45
aVkicked in a long time ago to a natural predator.
p46
aVJust like fear offers us protective benefits, disgust seems
p47
aVto do the same thing, except for what disgust does is
p48
aVkeeps us away from not things that might eat us,
p49
aVor heights, but rather things that might poison us,
p50
aVor give us disease and make us sick.
p51
aVSo one of the features of disgust that makes it such
p52
aVan interesting emotion is that it's very, very easy to elicit,
p53
aVin fact more so than probably any of the other basic emotions,
p54
aVand so I'm going to show you that with a couple of images
p55
aVI can probably make you feel disgust.
p56
aVSo turn away. I'll tell you when you can turn back.
p57
aV(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VI mean, you see it every day, right? I mean, come on. (Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
V(Audience: Ewww.)
p62
aa(lp63
VOkay, turn back, if you didn't look.
p64
aa(lp65
VThose probably made a lot of you in the audience
p66
aVfeel very, very disgusted, but if you didn't look,
p67
aVI can tell you about some of the other things that have been shown
p68
aVsort of across the world to make people disgusted,
p69
aVthings like feces, urine, blood, rotten flesh.
p70
aVThese are the sorts of things that it makes sense
p71
aVfor us to stay away from, because they might actually contaminate us.
p72
aVIn fact, just having a diseased appearance
p73
aVor odd sexual acts, these things are also
p74
aVthings that give us a lot of disgust.
p75
aa(lp76
VDarwin was probably one of the first scientists
p77
aVto systematically investigate the human emotions,
p78
aVand he pointed to the universal nature and the strength
p79
aVof the disgust response.
p80
aVThis is an anecdote from his travels in South America.
p81
aa(lp82
V"In Tierro del Fuego a native touched with his finger
p83
aVsome cold preserved meat while I was eating ...
p84
aVand plainly showed disgust at its softness, whilst I felt
p85
aVutter disgust at my food being touched by a naked savage \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p86
aVthough his hands did not appear dirty."
p87
aVHe later wrote, "It's okay, some of my best friends are naked savages." (Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VWell it turns out it's not only old-timey British scientists
p90
aVwho are this squeamish. I recently got a chance
p91
aVto talk to Richard Dawkins for a documentary,
p92
aVand I was able to disgust him a bunch of times. Here's my favorite.
p93
aa(lp94
VRichard Dawkins: "We've evolved around courtship and sex,
p95
aVare attached to deep-rooted emotions and reactions
p96
aVthat are hard to jettison overnight."
p97
aa(lp98
VDavid Pizarro: So my favorite part of this clip is that
p99
aVProfessor Dawkins actually gagged.
p100
aVHe jumps back, and he gags, and we had to do it three times,
p101
aVand all three times he gagged. (Laughter)
p102
aVAnd he was really gagging. I thought he might throw up on me, actually.
p103
aa(lp104
VOne of the features, though, of disgust,
p105
aVis not just its universality and its strength,
p106
aVbut the way that it works through association.
p107
aVSo when one disgusting thing touches a clean thing,
p108
aVthat clean thing becomes disgusting, not the other way around.
p109
aVThis makes it very useful as a strategy if you want to
p110
aVconvince somebody that an object or an individual
p111
aVor an entire social group is disgusting and should be avoided.
p112
aVThe philosopher Martha Nussbaum points this out
p113
aVin this quote: "Thus throughout history, certain disgust
p114
aVproperties \u2014 sliminess, bad smell, stickiness, decay, foulness \u2014
p115
aVhave been repeatedly and monotonously been associated with ...
p116
aVJews, women, homosexuals, untouchables, lower-class people \u2014
p117
aVall of those are imagined as tainted by the dirt of the body."
p118
aVLet me give you just some examples of how, some powerful
p119
aVexamples of how this has been used historically.
p120
aVThis comes from a Nazi children's book published in 1938:
p121
aV"Just look at these guys! The louse-infested beards,
p122
aVthe filthy, protruding ears, those stained, fatty clothes...
p123
aVJews often have an unpleasant sweetish odor.
p124
aVIf you have a good nose, you can smell the Jews."
p125
aVA more modern example comes from people who try to
p126
aVconvince us that homosexuality is immoral.
p127
aVThis is from an anti-gay website, where they said
p128
aVgays are "worthy of death for their vile ... sex practices."
p129
aVThey're like "dogs eating their own vomit and sows wallowing in their own feces."
p130
aVThese are disgust properties that are trying to be directly
p131
aVlinked to the social group that you should not like.
p132
aa(lp133
VWhen we were first investigating the role of disgust in
p134
aVmoral judgment, one of the things we became interested in
p135
aVwas whether or not these sorts of appeals are more likely
p136
aVto work in individuals who are more easily disgusted.
p137
aVSo while disgust, along with the other basic emotions,
p138
aVare universal phenomena, it just really is true
p139
aVthat some people are easier to disgust than others.
p140
aVYou could probably see it in the audience members
p141
aVwhen I showed you those disgusting images.
p142
aVThe way that we measured this was by a scale that was
p143
aVconstructed by some other psychologists
p144
aVthat simply asked people across a wide variety of situations
p145
aVhow likely they are to feel disgust.
p146
aVSo here are a couple of examples.
p147
aV"Even if I were hungry, I would not drink a bowl of my
p148
aVfavorite soup if it had been stirred by a used but thoroughly washed fly-swatter."
p149
aV"Do you agree or disagree?" (Laughter)
p150
aV"While you are walking through a tunnel under a railroad track,
p151
aVyou smell urine. Would you be very disgusted or not at all disgusted?"
p152
aVIf you ask enough of these, you can get a general overall
p153
aVscore of disgust sensitivity.
p154
aVIt turns out that this score is actually meaningful.
p155
aVWhen you bring people into the laboratory and you ask
p156
aVthem if they're willing to engage in safe but disgusting behaviors
p157
aVlike eating chocolate that's been baked to look like dog poop,
p158
aVor in this case eating some mealworms that are perfectly healthy but pretty gross,
p159
aVyour score on that scale actually predicts whether or not
p160
aVyou'll be willing to engage in those behaviors.
p161
aa(lp162
VThe first time that we set out to collect data on this
p163
aVand associate it with political or moral beliefs,
p164
aVwe found a general pattern \u2014
p165
aVthis is with the psychologists Yoel Inbar and Paul Bloom \u2014
p166
aVthat in fact, across three studies we kept finding
p167
aVthat people who reported that they were easily disgusted
p168
aValso reported that they were more politically conservative.
p169
aVAnother way to say this, though, is that people
p170
aVwho are very liberal are very hard to disgust. (Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
VIn a more recent follow-up study, we were able to look at
p173
aVa much greater sample, a much larger sample. In this case,
p174
aVthis is nearly 30,000 U.S. respondents,
p175
aVand we find the same pattern. As you can see,
p176
aVpeople who are on the very conservative side
p177
aVof answering the political orientation scale are
p178
aValso much more likely to report that they're easily disgusted.
p179
aVThis data set also allowed us to statistically control
p180
aVfor a number of things that we knew were both related
p181
aVto political orientation and to disgust sensitivity.
p182
aVSo we were able to control for gender, age, income,
p183
aVeducation, even basic personality variables,
p184
aVand the result stays the same.
p185
aa(lp186
VWhen we actually looked at not just self-reported political orientation,
p187
aVbut voting behavior, we were able to look geographically
p188
aVacross the nation. What we found was that in regions
p189
aVin which people reported high levels of disgust sensitivity,
p190
aVMcCain got more votes.
p191
aVSo it not only predicted self-reported political orientation,
p192
aVbut actual voting behavior. And also we were able,
p193
aVwith this sample, to look across the world,
p194
aVin 121 different countries we asked the same questions,
p195
aVand as you can see, this is 121 countries collapsed
p196
aVinto 10 different geographical regions.
p197
aVNo matter where you look, what this is plotting is the size
p198
aVof the relationship between disgust sensitivity and political orientation,
p199
aVand no matter where we looked, we saw a very similar effect.
p200
aVOther labs have actually looked at this as well
p201
aVusing different measures of disgust sensitivity,
p202
aVso rather than asking people how easily disgusted they are,
p203
aVthey hook people up to physiological measures,
p204
aVin this case skin conductance.
p205
aVAnd what they've demonstrated is that people who report
p206
aVbeing more politically conservative are also more physiologically aroused
p207
aVwhen you show them disgusting images like the ones that I showed you.
p208
aVInterestingly, what they also showed in a finding
p209
aVthat we kept getting in our previous studies as well
p210
aVwas that one of the strongest influences here is that
p211
aVindividuals who are very disgust-sensitive not only are
p212
aVmore likely to report being politically conservative, but
p213
aVthey're also very much more opposed to gay marriage
p214
aVand homosexuality and pretty much a lot of
p215
aVthe socio-moral issues in the sexual domain.
p216
aVSo physiological arousal predicted, in this study,
p217
aVattitudes toward gay marriage.
p218
aa(lp219
VBut even with all these data linking disgust sensitivity
p220
aVand political orientation, one of the questions that remains is
p221
aVwhat is the causal link here? Is it the case that
p222
aVdisgust really is shaping political and moral beliefs?
p223
aVWe have to resort to experimental methods to answer this,
p224
aVand so what we can do is actually bring people into the lab
p225
aVand disgust them and compare them to a control group
p226
aVthat hasn't been disgusted. It turns out that over
p227
aVthe past five years a number of researchers have done this,
p228
aVand by and large the results have all been the same,
p229
aVthat when people are feeling disgust, their attitudes
p230
aVshift towards the right of the political spectrum,
p231
aVtoward more moral conservatism as well.
p232
aVSo this is whether you use a foul odor, a bad taste,
p233
aVfrom film clips, from post-hypnotic suggestions of disgust,
p234
aVimages like the ones I've shown you, even just
p235
aVreminding people that disease is prevalent and they should
p236
aVbe wary of it and wash up, right, to keep clean,
p237
aVthese all have similar effects on judgment.
p238
aa(lp239
VLet me just give you an example from a recent study
p240
aVthat we conducted. We asked participants
p241
aVto just simply give us their opinion of a variety of social groups,
p242
aVand we either made the room smell gross or not.
p243
aVWhen the room smelled gross, what we saw was that
p244
aVindividuals actually reported more negative attitudes toward gay men.
p245
aVDisgust didn't influence attitudes toward all the other
p246
aVsocial groups that we asked, including African-Americans,
p247
aVthe elderly. It really came down to the attitudes they had
p248
aVtoward gay men.
p249
aVIn another set of studies we actually simply reminded people \u2014
p250
aVthis was at a time when the swine flu was going around \u2014
p251
aVwe reminded people that in order to prevent the spread
p252
aVof the flu that they ought to wash their hands.
p253
aVFor some participants, we actually had them take questionnaires
p254
aVnext to a sign that reminded them to wash their hands.
p255
aVAnd what we found was that just taking a questionnaire
p256
aVnext to this hand-sanitizing reminder made individuals
p257
aVreport being more politically conservative.
p258
aVAnd when we asked them a variety of questions about
p259
aVthe rightness or wrongness of certain acts, what we also
p260
aVfound was that simply being reminded that they ought
p261
aVto wash their hands made them more morally conservative.
p262
aVIn particular, when we asked them questions about
p263
aVsort of taboo but fairly harmless sexual practices,
p264
aVjust being reminded that they ought to wash their hands
p265
aVmade them think that they were more morally wrong.
p266
aVLet me give you an example of what I mean by harmless
p267
aVbut taboo sexual practice. We gave them scenarios.
p268
aVOne of them said a man is house-sitting for his grandmother.
p269
aVWhen his grandmother's away, he has sex with his girlfriend
p270
aVon his grandma's bed.
p271
aVIn another one, we said a woman enjoys masturbating
p272
aVwith her favorite teddy bear cuddled next to her. (Laughter)
p273
aVPeople find these to be more morally abhorrent
p274
aVif they've been reminded to wash their hands. (Laughter)
p275
aV(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
VOkay. The fact that emotions influence our judgment
p278
aVshould come as no surprise. I mean,
p279
aVthat's part of how emotions work.
p280
aVThey not only motivate you to behave in certain ways,
p281
aVbut they change the way you think.
p282
aVIn the case of disgust, what is a little bit more surprising
p283
aVis the scope of this influence. It makes perfect sense,
p284
aVand it's a very good emotion for us to have, that disgust
p285
aVwould make me change the way that I perceive
p286
aVthe physical world whenever contamination is possible.
p287
aVIt makes less sense that an emotion that was built
p288
aVto prevent me from ingesting poison should predict
p289
aVwho I'm going to vote for in the upcoming presidential election.
p290
aa(lp291
VThe question of whether disgust ought to influence
p292
aVour moral and political judgments
p293
aVcertainly has to be complex, and might depend on exactly
p294
aVwhat judgments we're talking about, and as a scientist,
p295
aVwe have to conclude sometimes that the scientific method
p296
aVis just ill-equipped to answer these sorts of questions.
p297
aVBut one thing that I am fairly certain about is,
p298
aVat the very least, what we can do with this research is
p299
aVpoint to what questions we ought to ask in the first place.
p300
aVThank you. (Applause)

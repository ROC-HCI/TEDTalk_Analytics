VDo you think it's possible to control someone's attention?
p5
aVEven more than that, what about predicting human behavior?
p6
aVI think those are interesting ideas.
p7
aVFor me, that would be the perfect superpower,
p8
aVactually kind of an evil way of approaching it.
p9
aVBut for myself, in the past, I've spent the last 20 years
p10
aVstudying human behavior from a rather unorthodox way:
p11
aVpicking pockets.
p12
aVWhen we think of misdirection,
p13
aVwe think of something as looking off to the side,
p14
aVwhen actually the things right in front of us
p15
aVare often the hardest to see,
p16
aVthe things that you look at every day that you're blinded to.
p17
aa(lp18
VFor example, how many of you still have your cell phones on you right now?
p19
aVGreat. Double-check.
p20
aVMake sure you still have them.
p21
aVI was doing some shopping before.
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VYou've looked at them a few times today,
p26
aVbut I'll ask you a question.
p27
aVWithout looking at it directly yet,
p28
aVcan you remember the icon in the bottom right corner?
p29
aVBring them out, check and see how accurate you were.
p30
aVHow'd you do?
p31
aVShow of hands. Did we get it?
p32
aa(lp33
VNow that you're done, close them down.
p34
aVEvery phone has something in common.
p35
aVNo matter how you organize the icons,
p36
aVyou still have a clock on the front.
p37
aVSo, without looking at your phone, what time was it?
p38
aVYou just looked at your clock, right?
p39
aVInteresting idea.
p40
aVLet's take that a step further with a game of trust.
p41
aVClose your eyes.
p42
aVI realize I'm asking you to do that while you just heard
p43
aVthere's a pickpocket in the room, but close your eyes.
p44
aa(lp45
VNow, you've been watching me for about 30 seconds.
p46
aVWith your eyes closed, what am I wearing?
p47
aVMake your best guess.
p48
aVWhat color is my shirt? What color is my tie?
p49
aVNow open your eyes.
p50
aVShow of hands, were you right?
p51
aVInteresting, isn't it?
p52
aa(lp53
VSome of us are a little bit more perceptive than others, it seems.
p54
aVBut I have a different theory about that model of attention.
p55
aVThey have fancy models of attention, Posner's trinity model of attention.
p56
aVFor me, I like to think of it very simple, like a surveillance system.
p57
aVIt's kind of like you have all these fancy sensors,
p58
aVand inside your brain is a little security guard.
p59
aVFor me, I like to call him Frank.
p60
aVSo Frank is sitting at a desk.
p61
aVHe's got lots of cool information in front of him,
p62
aVhigh-tech equipment, he's got cameras,
p63
aVhe's got a little phone that he can pick up, listen to the ears,
p64
aVall these senses, all these perceptions.
p65
aVBut attention is what steers your perceptions,
p66
aVit's what controls your reality.
p67
aVIt's the gateway to the mind.
p68
aVIf you don't attend to something, you can't be aware of it.
p69
aVBut ironically, you can attend to something without being aware of it.
p70
aVFor example, the cocktail effect:
p71
aVYou're in a party, having conversations with someone,
p72
aVand yet you can recognize your name
p73
aVwithout realizing you were listening to that.
p74
aa(lp75
VNow, for my job, I have to play with techniques to exploit this,
p76
aVto play with your attention as a limited resource.
p77
aVSo if I could control how you spend your attention,
p78
aVif I could maybe steal your attention through a distraction.
p79
aVNow, instead of doing it like misdirection
p80
aVand throwing it off to the side,
p81
aVinstead, what I choose to focus on is Frank,
p82
aVto be able to play with the Frank inside your head,
p83
aVyour security guard,
p84
aVand get you, instead of focusing on your external senses,
p85
aVjust to go internal for a second.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo if I ask you to access a memory, like, what is that?
p88
aVWhat just happened? Do you have a wallet?
p89
aVDo you have an American Express in your wallet?
p90
aVAnd when I do that, your Frank turns around.
p91
aVHe accesses the file. He has to rewind the tape.
p92
aVWhat's interesting is, he can't rewind the tape
p93
aVat the same time that he's trying to process new data.
p94
aa(lp95
VThis sounds like a good theory,
p96
aVbut I could talk for a long time, tell you lots of things,
p97
aVand a portion of them may be true,
p98
aVbut I think it's better if I tried to show that to you here live.
p99
aVIf I come down, I'm going to do a bit of shopping.
p100
aVJust hold still where you are.
p101
aa(lp102
VHello, how are you? It's lovely to see you.
p103
aVWonderful job onstage.
p104
aVLovely watch, it doesn't come off very well.
p105
aVDo you have a ring as well?
p106
aVGood. Just taking inventory. You're like a buffet.
p107
aVHard to tell where to start, so many great things.
p108
aa(lp109
VHi, how are you? Good to see you.
p110
aa(lp111
VHi, sir, could you stand up, please? Just right where you are.
p112
aVYou're married, you follow directions well.
p113
aVNice to meet you, sir.
p114
aVYou don't have a lot in your pockets. Anything down here?
p115
aVHopefully so. Have a seat. There you go. You're doing well.
p116
aa(lp117
VHi, sir, how are you?
p118
aVGood to see you, sir. You have a ring, a watch.
p119
aVDo you have a wallet on you? Joe: I don't.
p120
aa(lp121
VAR: Well, we'll find one for you. Come on up this way, Joe.
p122
aVGive Joe a round of applause. Come on up, Joe. Let's play a game.
p123
aa(lp124
V(Applause)
p125
aa(lp126
VAR: Pardon me.
p127
aVI don't think I need this clicker anymore.
p128
aVThank you very much. I appreciate that.
p129
aVCome on up to the stage, Joe. Let's play a little game now.
p130
aVAnything in your front pockets?
p131
aa(lp132
VJ: Money.
p133
aa(lp134
VAR: Money! All right, let's try that.
p135
aVCan you stand right over this way for me?
p136
aVTurn around and, let's see,
p137
aVif I give you something that belongs to me,
p138
aVthis is just something I have,
p139
aVa poker chip.
p140
aVHold out your hand for me.
p141
aVWatch it closely.
p142
aVThis is a task for you to focus on.
p143
aVYou have your money in your front pocket?
p144
aa(lp145
VJ: Yup. AR: Good.
p146
aa(lp147
VI won't put my hand in your pocket. I'm not ready for that kind of commitment.
p148
aVOnce a guy had a hole in his pocket,
p149
aVand that was rather traumatizing for me.
p150
aVI wanted his wallet, he gave me his number.
p151
aVBig miscommunication.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VLet's do this simply. Squeeze your hand tight.
p156
aVDo you feel the poker chip in your hand?
p157
aa(lp158
VJ: I do.
p159
aa(lp160
VAR: Would you be surprised if I took it? Say yes.
p161
aa(lp162
VJ: Very. AR: Good.
p163
aa(lp164
VOpen your hand. Thank you very much.
p165
aVI'll cheat if you give me a chance.
p166
aVMake it harder for me. Just use your hand.
p167
aVGrab my wrist, but squeeze, squeeze firm.
p168
aVDid you see it go? Joe: No.
p169
aa(lp170
VAR: No, it's not here. Open your hand.
p171
aVWhile we're focused on the hand, it's sitting on your shoulder.
p172
aVGo ahead and take it off.
p173
aVNow, let's try that again.
p174
aVHold your hand out flat. Open it up.
p175
aVPut your hand up a little bit higher, but watch it close.
p176
aVIf I did it slowly, it'd be on your shoulder.
p177
aa(lp178
V(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VJoe, we're going to keep doing this till you catch it.
p181
aVYou'll get it eventually. I have faith in you.
p182
aVSqueeze firm. You're human, you're not slow.
p183
aVIt's back on your shoulder.
p184
aVYou were focused on your hand, distracted.
p185
aVWhile you were watching, I couldn't get your watch off.
p186
aVYet you had something inside your pocket.
p187
aVDo you remember what it was?
p188
aa(lp189
VJ: Money.
p190
aa(lp191
VAR: Check your pocket. Is it still there?
p192
aa(lp193
V(Laughter)
p194
aa(lp195
VOh, there it was. Put it away.
p196
aVWe're just shopping.
p197
aVThis trick's more about the timing.
p198
aVI'm going to try to push it inside your hand.
p199
aVPut your other hand on top, would you?
p200
aVIt's amazingly obvious now, isn't it?
p201
aVLooks a lot like the watch I was wearing, doesn't it?
p202
aa(lp203
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p204
aa(lp205
VJ: That's pretty good. AR: Oh, thanks.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Applause)
p208
aa(lp209
VBut it's only a start. Let's try it a little bit differently.
p210
aVHold your hands together. Your other hand on top.
p211
aVIf you're watching this little token,
p212
aVthis obviously has become a little target, like a red herring.
p213
aVIf we watch this kind of close, it looks like it goes away.
p214
aVIt's not back on your shoulder.
p215
aVIt falls out of the air, lands right back in the hand.
p216
aVDid you see it go?
p217
aVYeah, funny. We've got a little guy. He's union, works up there all day.
p218
aVIf I do it slowly it goes straight away, it lands by your pocket.
p219
aVIs it in this pocket, sir?
p220
aVDon't reach in your pocket. That's a different show.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Squeaking)
p223
aa(lp224
VThat's rather strange. They have shots for that.
p225
aVCan I show them? Rather bizarre. Is this yours, sir?
p226
aVI have no idea how that works. We'll send that over there.
p227
aa(lp228
VI need help with this one.
p229
aVStep over this way for me.
p230
aVDon't run away. You had something down by your pants pocket.
p231
aVI was checking mine. I couldn't find everything,
p232
aVbut I noticed you had something here.
p233
aVCan I feel the outside for a moment?
p234
aVDown here I noticed this. Is this something of yours, sir?
p235
aVI have no idea. That's a shrimp.
p236
aa(lp237
VJ: Yeah. I'm saving it for later.
p238
aa(lp239
VAR: You've entertained all of these people in a wonderful way,
p240
aVbetter than you know.
p241
aVSo we'd love to give you this lovely watch as a gift.
p242
aa(lp243
V(Laughter)
p244
aa(lp245
VHopefully it matches his taste.
p246
aVWe have a couple of other things,
p247
aVa little bit of cash.
p248
aVAnd we have a few other things,
p249
aVthese all belong to you,
p250
aValong with a big round of applause from all your friends.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Applause)
p253
aa(lp254
VJoe, thank you very much.
p255
aa(lp256
V(Applause)
p257
aa(lp258
V(Applause ends)
p259
aa(lp260
VSo, same question I asked you before,
p261
aVbut this time you don't have to close your eyes.
p262
aVWhat am I wearing?
p263
aa(lp264
VAudience: Oh!
p265
aa(lp266
V(Laughter)
p267
aa(lp268
V(Hesitant applause)
p269
aa(lp270
V(Applause ends)
p271
aa(lp272
VAttention is a powerful thing.
p273
aVLike I said, it shapes your reality.
p274
aVSo, I guess I'd like to pose that question to you.
p275
aVIf you could control somebody's attention,
p276
aVwhat would you do with it?
p277
aa(lp278
VThank you.
p279
aa(lp280

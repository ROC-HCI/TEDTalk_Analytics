VI have spent my entire life
p5
aVeither at the schoolhouse, on the way to the schoolhouse,
p6
aVor talking about what happens in the schoolhouse.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VBoth my parents were educators,
p11
aVmy maternal grandparents were educators,
p12
aVand for the past 40 years, I've done the same thing.
p13
aVAnd so, needless to say, over those years
p14
aVI've had a chance to look at education reform
p15
aVfrom a lot of perspectives.
p16
aVSome of those reforms have been good.
p17
aVSome of them have been not so good.
p18
aVAnd we know why kids drop out.
p19
aVWe know why kids don't learn.
p20
aVIt's either poverty, low attendance,
p21
aVnegative peer influences...
p22
aVWe know why.
p23
aVBut one of the things that we never discuss
p24
aVor we rarely discuss
p25
aVis the value and importance of human connection.
p26
aVRelationships.
p27
aa(lp28
VJames Comer says that no significant learning
p29
aVcan occur without a significant relationship.
p30
aVGeorge Washington Carver says all learning
p31
aVis understanding relationships.
p32
aVEveryone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult.
p33
aVFor years, I have watched people teach.
p34
aVI have looked at the best and I've looked at some of the worst.
p35
aa(lp36
VA colleague said to me one time,
p37
aV"They don't pay me to like the kids.
p38
aVThey pay me to teach a lesson.
p39
aVThe kids should learn it.
p40
aVI should teach it, they should learn it,
p41
aVCase closed."
p42
aa(lp43
VWell, I said to her,
p44
aV"You know, kids don't learn from people they don't like."
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
V(Applause)
p49
aa(lp50
VShe said, "That's just a bunch of hooey."
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd I said to her,
p53
aa(lp54
V"Well, your year is going to be long and arduous, dear."
p55
aa(lp56
VNeedless to say, it was.
p57
aVSome people think that you can either have it in you to build a relationship,
p58
aVor you don't.
p59
aVI think Stephen Covey had the right idea.
p60
aVHe said you ought to just throw in a few simple things,
p61
aVlike seeking first to understand,
p62
aVas opposed to being understood.
p63
aVSimple things, like apologizing.
p64
aVYou ever thought about that?
p65
aVTell a kid you're sorry, they're in shock.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VI taught a lesson once on ratios.
p70
aVI'm not real good with math, but I was working on it.
p71
aa(lp72
V(Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd I got back and looked at that teacher edition.
p75
aVI'd taught the whole lesson wrong.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VSo I came back to class the next day and I said,
p80
aV"Look, guys, I need to apologize.
p81
aVI taught the whole lesson wrong. I'm so sorry."
p82
aa(lp83
VThey said, "That's okay, Ms. Pierson.
p84
aVYou were so excited, we just let you go."
p85
aa(lp86
VI have had classes that were so low,
p87
aVso academically deficient, that I cried.
p88
aVI wondered, "How am I going to take this group,
p89
aVin nine months,
p90
aVfrom where they are to where they need to be?
p91
aVAnd it was difficult, it was awfully hard.
p92
aVHow do I raise the self-esteem of a child
p93
aVand his academic achievement at the same time?
p94
aa(lp95
VOne year I came up with a bright idea.
p96
aVI told all my students,
p97
aV"You were chosen to be in my class
p98
aVbecause I am the best teacher
p99
aVand you are the best students,
p100
aVthey put us all together
p101
aVso we could show everybody else how to do it."
p102
aa(lp103
VOne of the students said, "Really?"
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VI said, "Really. We have to show the other classes
p108
aVhow to do it, so when we walk down the hall,
p109
aVpeople will notice us, so you can't make noise.
p110
aVYou just have to strut."
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd I gave them a saying to say:
p115
aV"I am somebody.
p116
aVI was somebody when I came.
p117
aVI'll be a better somebody when I leave.
p118
aVI am powerful, and I am strong.
p119
aVI deserve the education that I get here.
p120
aVI have things to do, people to impress,
p121
aVand places to go."
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd they said, "Yeah!"
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VYou say it long enough,
p128
aVit starts to be a part of you.
p129
aa(lp130
V(Applause)
p131
aa(lp132
VI gave a quiz, 20 questions.
p133
aVA student missed 18.
p134
aVI put a "+2" on his paper and a big smiley face.
p135
aa(lp136
V(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
VHe said, "Ms. Pierson, is this an F?"
p139
aa(lp140
VI said, "Yes."
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VHe said, "Then why'd you put a smiley face?"
p145
aa(lp146
VI said, "Because you're on a roll.
p147
aVYou got two right. You didn't miss them all."
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VI said, "And when we review this, won't you do better?"
p152
aa(lp153
VHe said, "Yes, ma'am, I can do better."
p154
aa(lp155
VYou see, "-18" sucks all the life out of you.
p156
aV"+2" said, "I ain't all bad."
p157
aa(lp158
VFor years, I watched my mother take the time at recess to review,
p159
aVgo on home visits in the afternoon,
p160
aVbuy combs and brushes and peanut butter and crackers
p161
aVto put in her desk drawer for kids that needed to eat,
p162
aVand a washcloth and some soap for the kids who didn't smell so good.
p163
aVSee, it's hard to teach kids who stink.
p164
aa(lp165
V(Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd kids can be cruel.
p168
aVAnd so she kept those things in her desk,
p169
aVand years later, after she retired,
p170
aVI watched some of those same kids come through
p171
aVand say to her, "You know, Ms. Walker,
p172
aVyou made a difference in my life.
p173
aVYou made it work for me.
p174
aVYou made me feel like I was somebody,
p175
aVwhen I knew, at the bottom, I wasn't.
p176
aVAnd I want you to just see what I've become."
p177
aa(lp178
VAnd when my mama died two years ago at 92,
p179
aVthere were so many former students at her funeral,
p180
aVit brought tears to my eyes, not because she was gone,
p181
aVbut because she left a legacy of relationships
p182
aVthat could never disappear.
p183
aa(lp184
VCan we stand to have more relationships?
p185
aVAbsolutely.
p186
aVWill you like all your children? Of course not.
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
VAnd you know your toughest kids are never absent.
p191
aa(lp192
V(Laughter)
p193
aa(lp194
VNever.
p195
aVYou won't like them all,
p196
aVand the tough ones show up for a reason.
p197
aVIt's the connection. It's the relationships.
p198
aVSo teachers become great actors and great actresses,
p199
aVand we come to work when we don't feel like it,
p200
aVand we're listening to policy that doesn't make sense,
p201
aVand we teach anyway.
p202
aVWe teach anyway, because that's what we do.
p203
aa(lp204
VTeaching and learning should bring joy.
p205
aVHow powerful would our world be
p206
aVif we had kids who were not afraid to take risks,
p207
aVwho were not afraid to think,
p208
aVand who had a champion?
p209
aVEvery child deserves a champion,
p210
aVan adult who will never give up on them,
p211
aVwho understands the power of connection,
p212
aVand insists that they become the best that they can possibly be.
p213
aa(lp214
VIs this job tough? You betcha.
p215
aVOh God, you betcha.
p216
aVBut it is not impossible.
p217
aVWe can do this. We're educators.
p218
aVWe're born to make a difference.
p219
aa(lp220
VThank you so much.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Applause)

Focusing on the students who are too often under-served, she lectured on topics like &ldquo;Helping Under-Resourced Learners,&rdquo;&ldquo;Meeting the Educational Needs of African American Boys&quot; and &quot;Engage and Graduate your Secondary Students: Preventing Dropouts.&quot;</p><p>Pierson passed away in June 2013.</p>", "slug": "rita_f_pierson", "whotheyare": "Rita F.

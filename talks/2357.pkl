VInterpreter: Piano, "p," is my favorite musical symbol.
p5
aVIt means to play softly.
p6
aVIf you're playing a musical instrument and you notice a "p" in the score,
p7
aVyou need to play softer.
p8
aVTwo p's \u2014 even softer.
p9
aVFour p's \u2014 extremely soft.
p10
aVThis is my drawing of a p-tree,
p11
aVwhich demonstrates
p12
aVno matter how many thousands upon thousands of p's there may be,
p13
aVyou'll never reach complete silence.
p14
aVThat's my current definition of silence:
p15
aVa very obscure sound.
p16
aa(lp17
VI'd like to share a little bit
p18
aVabout the history of American Sign Language, ASL,
p19
aVplus a bit of my own background.
p20
aVFrench sign language was brought to America during the early 1800s,
p21
aVand as time went by, mixed with local signs,
p22
aVit evolved into the language we know today as ASL.
p23
aVSo it has a history of about 200 years.
p24
aa(lp25
VI was born deaf,
p26
aVand I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
p27
aVAnd I believed it to be true.
p28
aVYet, I realize now that that wasn't the case at all.
p29
aVSound was very much a part of my life,
p30
aVreally, on my mind every day.
p31
aVAs a Deaf person living in a world of sound,
p32
aVit's as if I was living in a foreign country,
p33
aVblindly following its rules, customs, behaviors and norms
p34
aVwithout ever questioning them.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo how is it that I understand sound?
p37
aVWell, I watch how people behave and respond to sound.
p38
aVYou people are like my loudspeakers, and amplify sound.
p39
aVI learn and mirror that behavior.
p40
aVAt the same time, I've learned that I create sound,
p41
aVand I've seen how people respond to me.
p42
aVThus I've learned, for example ...
p43
aV"Don't slam the door!"
p44
aV"Don't make too much noise when you're eating from the potato-chip bag!"
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
V"Don't burp,
p49
aVand when you're eating,
p50
aVmake sure you don't scrape your utensils on the plate."
p51
aVAll of these things I term "sound etiquette."
p52
aVMaybe I think about sound etiquette
p53
aVmore than the average hearing person does.
p54
aVI'm hyper-vigilant around sound.
p55
aVAnd I'm always waiting in eager nervous anticipation
p56
aVaround sound, about what's to come next.
p57
aa(lp58
VHence, this drawing.
p59
aVTBD, to be decided.
p60
aVTBC, to be continued.
p61
aVTBA, to be announced.
p62
aVAnd you notice the staff \u2014
p63
aVthere are no notes contained in the lines.
p64
aVThat's because the lines already contain sound
p65
aVthrough the subtle smudges and smears.
p66
aa(lp67
VIn Deaf culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
p68
aVThis is a sign for "staff" in ASL.
p69
aVA typical staff contains five lines.
p70
aVYet for me, signing it with my thumb sticking up like that
p71
aVdoesn't feel natural.
p72
aVThat's why you'll notice in my drawings, I stick to four lines on paper.
p73
aa(lp74
VIn the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany,
p75
aVfor an artist residency there.
p76
aVPrior to this time, I had been working as a painter.
p77
aVDuring this summer, I visited different museums and gallery spaces,
p78
aVand as I went from one place to the next,
p79
aVI noticed there was no visual art there.
p80
aVAt that time, sound was trending, and this struck me ...
p81
aVthere was no visual art,
p82
aVeverything was auditory.
p83
aa(lp84
VNow sound has come into my art territory.
p85
aVIs it going to further distance me from art?
p86
aVI realized that doesn't have to be the case at all.
p87
aVI actually know sound.
p88
aVI know it so well
p89
aVthat it doesn't have to be something just experienced through the ears.
p90
aVIt could be felt tactually,
p91
aVor experienced as a visual,
p92
aVor even as an idea.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo I decided to reclaim ownership of sound
p95
aVand to put it into my art practice.
p96
aVAnd everything that I had been taught regarding sound,
p97
aVI decided to do away with and unlearn.
p98
aVI started creating a new body of work.
p99
aVAnd when I presented this to the art community,
p100
aVI was blown away with the amount of support and attention I received.
p101
aVI realized:
p102
aVsound is like money,
p103
aVpower, control \u2014
p104
aVsocial currency.
p105
aVIn the back of my mind, I've always felt that sound was your thing,
p106
aVa hearing person's thing.
p107
aVAnd sound is so powerful
p108
aVthat it could either disempower me and my artwork,
p109
aVor it could empower me.
p110
aVI chose to be empowered.
p111
aa(lp112
VThere's a massive culture around spoken language.
p113
aVAnd just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate,
p114
aVin society's eyes it's as if I don't have a voice at all.
p115
aVSo I need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal
p116
aVand become my voice.
p117
aVAnd that way, I'm able to maintain relevancy in society today.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo at school, at work and institutions,
p120
aVI work with many different ASL interpreters.
p121
aVAnd their voice becomes my voice and identity.
p122
aVThey help me to be heard.
p123
aVAnd their voices hold value and currency.
p124
aVIronically, by borrowing out their voices,
p125
aVI'm able to maintain a temporary form of currency,
p126
aVkind of like taking out a loan with a very high interest rate.
p127
aVIf I didn't continue this practice,
p128
aVI feel that I could just fade off into oblivion
p129
aVand not maintain any form of social currency.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo with sound as my new art medium,
p132
aVI delved into the world of music.
p133
aVAnd I was surprised to see the similarities between music and ASL.
p134
aVFor example,
p135
aVa musical note
p136
aVcannot be fully captured and expressed on paper.
p137
aVAnd the same holds true for a concept in ASL.
p138
aVThey're both highly spatial and highly inflected \u2014
p139
aVmeaning that subtle changes
p140
aVcan affect the entire meaning
p141
aVof both signs and sounds.
p142
aa(lp143
VI'd like to share with you a piano metaphor,
p144
aVto have you have a better understanding of how ASL works.
p145
aVSo, envision a piano.
p146
aVASL is broken down into many different grammatical parameters.
p147
aVIf you assign a different parameter to each finger as you play the piano \u2014
p148
aVsuch as facial expression, body movement,
p149
aVspeed, hand shape and so on,
p150
aVas you play the piano \u2014
p151
aVEnglish is a linear language,
p152
aVas if one key is being pressed at a time.
p153
aVHowever, ASL is more like a chord \u2014
p154
aVall 10 fingers need to come down simultaneously
p155
aVto express a clear concept or idea in ASL.
p156
aVIf just one of those keys were to change the chord,
p157
aVit would create a completely different meaning.
p158
aVThe same applies to music in regards to pitch, tone and volume.
p159
aVIn ASL, by playing around with these different grammatical parameters,
p160
aVyou can express different ideas.
p161
aa(lp162
VFor example, take the sign TO-LOOK-AT.
p163
aVThis is the sign TO-LOOK-AT.
p164
aVI'm looking at you.
p165
aVStaring at you.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
V(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VOh \u2014 busted.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
VUh-oh.
p176
aVWhat are you looking at?
p177
aVAw, stop.
p178
aa(lp179
V(Laughter)
p180
aa(lp181
VI then started thinking,
p182
aV"What if I was to look at ASL through a musical lens?"
p183
aVIf I was to create a sign and repeat it over and over,
p184
aVit could become like a piece of visual music.
p185
aVFor example, this is the sign for "day,"
p186
aVas the sun rises and sets.
p187
aVThis is "all day."
p188
aVIf I was to repeat it and slow it down,
p189
aVvisually it looks like a piece of music.
p190
aVAll ... day.
p191
aVI feel the same holds true for "all night."
p192
aV"All night."
p193
aVThis is ALL-NIGHT, represented in this drawing.
p194
aVAnd this led me to thinking about three different kinds of nights:
p195
aV"last night,"
p196
aV"overnight,"
p197
aV(Sings) "all night long."
p198
aa(lp199
V(Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
VI feel like the third one has a lot more musicality than the other two.
p202
aa(lp203
V(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
VThis represents how time is expressed in ASL
p206
aVand how the distance from your body can express the changes in time.
p207
aVFor example,
p208
aV1H is one hand, 2H is two hand,
p209
aVpresent tense happens closest and in front of the body,
p210
aVfuture is in front of the body and the past is to your back.
p211
aVSo, the first example is "a long time ago."
p212
aVThen "past,"
p213
aV"used to"
p214
aVand the last one, which is my favorite,
p215
aVwith the very romantic and dramatic notion to it,
p216
aV"once upon a time."
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
V"Common time"
p221
aVis a musical term
p222
aVwith a specific time signature of four beats per measure.
p223
aVYet when I see the word "common time,"
p224
aVwhat automatically comes to mind for me is "at the same time."
p225
aVSo notice RH: right hand, LH: left hand.
p226
aVWe have the staff across the head and the chest.
p227
aa(lp228
V[Head: RH, Flash claw]
p229
aa(lp230
V[Common time]
p231
aa(lp232
V[Chest: LH, Flash claw]
p233
aa(lp234
VI'm now going to demonstrate a hand shape called the "flash claw."
p235
aVCan you please follow along with me?
p236
aVEverybody, hands up.
p237
aVNow we're going to do it in both the head and the chest,
p238
aVkind of like "common time" or at the same time.
p239
aVYes, got it.
p240
aVThat means "to fall in love" in International [Sign].
p241
aa(lp242
V(Laughter)
p243
aa(lp244
VInternational [Sign], as a note,
p245
aVis a visual tool to help communicate
p246
aVacross cultures and sign languages around the world.
p247
aa(lp248
VThe second one I'd like to demonstrate is this \u2014
p249
aVplease follow along with me again.
p250
aVAnd now this.
p251
aVThis is "colonization" in ASL.
p252
aa(lp253
V(Laughter)
p254
aa(lp255
VNow the third \u2014
p256
aVplease follow along again.
p257
aVAnd again.
p258
aVThis is "enlightenment" in ASL.
p259
aVSo let's do all three together.
p260
aV"Fall in love,"
p261
aV"colonization"
p262
aVand "enlightenment."
p263
aVGood job, everyone.
p264
aa(lp265
V(Laughter)
p266
aa(lp267
VNotice how all three signs are very similar,
p268
aVthey all happen at the head and the chest,
p269
aVbut they convey quite different meanings.
p270
aa(lp271
VSo it's amazing to see how ASL is alive and thriving,
p272
aVjust like music is.
p273
aVHowever, in this day and age,
p274
aVwe live in a very audio-centric world.
p275
aVAnd just because ASL has no sound to it,
p276
aVit automatically holds no social currency.
p277
aVWe need to start thinking harder about what defines social currency
p278
aVand allow ASL to develop its own form of currency \u2014
p279
aVwithout sound.
p280
aVAnd this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society.
p281
aVAnd maybe people will understand
p282
aVthat you don't need to be deaf to learn ASL,
p283
aVnor do you have to be hearing to learn music.
p284
aa(lp285
VASL is such a rich treasure
p286
aVthat I'd like you to have the same experience.
p287
aVAnd I'd like to invite you to open your ears,
p288
aVto open your eyes,
p289
aVtake part in our culture
p290
aVand experience our visual language.
p291
aVAnd you never know,
p292
aVyou might just fall in love with us.
p293
aa(lp294
V(Applause)
p295
aa(lp296
VThank you.
p297
aa(lp298
VDenise Kahler-Braaten: Hey, that's me.

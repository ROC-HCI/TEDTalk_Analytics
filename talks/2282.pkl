VThis summer I was back in Ohio for a family wedding,
p5
aVand when I was there,
p6
aVthere was a meet and greet with Anna and Elsa from "Frozen."
p7
aVNot the Anna and Elsa from "Frozen,"
p8
aVas this was not a Disney-sanctioned event.
p9
aVThese two entrepreneurs had a business of running princess parties.
p10
aVYour kid is turning five?
p11
aVThey'll come sing some songs, sprinkle some fairy dust, it's great.
p12
aVAnd they were not about to miss out on the opportunity
p13
aVthat was the phenomenon and that was "Frozen."
p14
aa(lp15
VSo they get hired by a local toy store,
p16
aVkids come in on a Saturday morning,
p17
aVbuy some Disney swag, get their picture taken with the princesses,
p18
aVcall it a day.
p19
aVIt's like Santa Claus without the seasonal restrictions.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd my three-and-a-half-year-old niece Samantha was in the thick of it.
p23
aVShe could care less that these two women were signing posters and coloring books
p24
aVas Snow Queen and Princess Ana with one N to avoid copyright lawsuits.
p25
aV(Laughter)
p26
aVAccording to my niece and the 200-plus kids in the parking lot that day,
p27
aVthis was the Anna and Elsa from "Frozen."
p28
aa(lp29
VIt is a blazing hot Saturday morning in August in Ohio.
p30
aVWe get there at 10 o'clock, the scheduled start time,
p31
aVand we are handed number 59.
p32
aVBy 11 o'clock they had called numbers 21 through 25;
p33
aVthis was going to be a while,
p34
aVand there is no amount of free face painting or temporary tattoos
p35
aVthat could prevent the meltdowns that were occurring outside of the store.
p36
aV(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VSo, by 12:30 we get called:
p39
aV"56 to 63, please."
p40
aVAnd as we walk in, it is a scene I can only describe you
p41
aVas saying it looked like Norway threw up.
p42
aV(Laughter)
p43
aVThere were cardboard cut-out snowflakes covering the floor,
p44
aVglitter on every flat surface, and icicles all over the walls.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd as we stood in line
p47
aVin an attempt to give my niece a better vantage point
p48
aVthan the backside of the mother of number 58,
p49
aVI put her up on my shoulders,
p50
aVand she was instantly riveted by the sight of the princesses.
p51
aVAnd as we moved forward, her excitement only grew,
p52
aVand as we finally got to the front of the line,
p53
aVand number 58 unfurled her poster to be signed by the princesses,
p54
aVI could literally feel the excitement running through her body.
p55
aVAnd let's be honest, at that point, I was pretty excited too.
p56
aV(Laughter)
p57
aVI mean, the Scandinavian decadence was mesmerizing.
p58
aV(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VSo we get to the front of the line,
p61
aVand the haggard clerk turns to my niece and says,
p62
aV"Hi, honey. You're next!
p63
aVDo you want to get down, or you're going to stay
p64
aVon your dad's shoulders for the picture?'
p65
aV(Laughter)
p66
aVAnd I was, for a lack of a better word, frozen.
p67
aV(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VIt's amazing that in an unexpected instant we are faced with the question,
p70
aVwho am I?
p71
aVAm I an aunt? Or am I an advocate?
p72
aVMillions of people have seen my video about how to have a hard conversation,
p73
aVand there one was, right in front of me.
p74
aVAt the same time,
p75
aVthere's nothing more important to me than the kids in my life,
p76
aVso I found myself in a situation that we so often find ourselves in,
p77
aVtorn between two things, two impossible choices.
p78
aVWould I be an advocate?
p79
aVWould I take my niece off my shoulders and turn to the clerk and explain to her
p80
aVthat I was in fact her aunt, not her father,
p81
aVand that she should be more careful
p82
aVand not to jump to gender conclusions based on haircuts and shoulder rides \u2014
p83
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p84
aVand while doing that,
p85
aVmiss out on what was, to this point, the greatest moment of my niece's life.
p86
aVOr would I be an aunt?
p87
aVWould I brush off that comment, take a million pictures,
p88
aVand not be distracted for an instant from the pure joy of that moment,
p89
aVand by doing that,
p90
aVwalk out with the shame that comes up for not standing up for myself,
p91
aVespecially in front of my niece.
p92
aa(lp93
VWho was I?
p94
aVWhich one was more important? Which role was more worth it?
p95
aVWas I an aunt? Or was I an advocate?
p96
aVAnd I had a split second to decide.
p97
aa(lp98
VWe are taught right now
p99
aVthat we are living in a world of constant and increasing polarity.
p100
aVIt's so black and white, so us and them, so right and wrong.
p101
aVThere is no middle, there is no gray, just polarity.
p102
aVPolarity is a state in which two ideas or opinions
p103
aVare completely opposite from each other;
p104
aVa diametrical opposition.
p105
aVWhich side are you on?
p106
aVAre you unequivocally and without question antiwar, pro-choice, anti-death penalty,
p107
aVpro-gun regulation, proponent of open borders and pro-union?
p108
aVOr, are you absolutely  and uncompromisingly
p109
aVpro-war, pro-life, pro-death penalty,
p110
aVa believer that the Second Amendment is absolute,
p111
aVanti-immigrant and pro-business?
p112
aVIt's all or none, you're with us or against us.
p113
aVThat is polarity.
p114
aa(lp115
VThe problem with polarity  and absolutes is that
p116
aVit eliminates the individuality of our human experience
p117
aVand that makes it contradictory to our human nature.
p118
aVBut if we are pulled in these two directions,
p119
aVbut it's not really where we exist \u2014
p120
aVpolarity is not our actual reality \u2014
p121
aVwhere do we go from there?
p122
aVWhat's at the other end of that spectrum?
p123
aa(lp124
VI don't think it's an unattainable, harmonious utopia,
p125
aVI think the opposite of polarity is duality.
p126
aVDuality is a state of having two parts,
p127
aVbut not in diametrical opposition,
p128
aVin simultaneous existence.
p129
aVDon't think it's possible?
p130
aVHere are the people I know:
p131
aVI know Catholics who are pro-choice, and feminists who wear hijabs,
p132
aVand veterans who are antiwar,
p133
aVand NRA members who think I should be able to get married.
p134
aVThose are the people I know, those are my friends and family,
p135
aVthat is the majority of our society, that is you, that is me.
p136
aV(Applause)
p137
aVDuality is the ability to hold both things.
p138
aVBut the question is: Can we own our duality?
p139
aVCan we have the courage to hold both things?
p140
aa(lp141
VI work at a restaurant in town,
p142
aVI became really good friends with the busser.
p143
aVI was a server and we had  a great relationship,
p144
aVwe had a really great time together.
p145
aVHer Spanish was great
p146
aVbecause she was from Mexico.
p147
aV(Laughter)
p148
aVThat line actually went the other way.
p149
aVHer English was limited, but significantly better than my Spanish.
p150
aVBut we were united by our similarities,
p151
aVnot separated by our differences.
p152
aVAnd we were close, even though we came from very different worlds.
p153
aVShe was from Mexico,
p154
aVshe left her family behind so she could come here
p155
aVand afford them a better life back home.
p156
aVShe was a devout conservative Catholic,
p157
aVa believer in traditional family values,
p158
aVstereotypical roles of men and women,
p159
aVand I was, well, me.
p160
aV(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VBut the things that bonded us were when she asked about my girlfriend,
p163
aVor she shared pictures that she had from her family back home.
p164
aVThose were the things that brought us together.
p165
aVSo one day, we were in the back,
p166
aVscarfing down food as quickly as we could, gathered around a small table,
p167
aVduring a very rare lull,
p168
aVand a new guy from the kitchen came over \u2014
p169
aVwho happened to be her cousin \u2014
p170
aVand sat down with all the bravado and machismo
p171
aVthat his 20-year-old body could hold.
p172
aV(Laughter)
p173
aVAnd he said to her, [in Spanish] "Does Ash have a boyfriend?"
p174
aVAnd she said, [in Spanish] "No, she has a girlfriend."
p175
aVAnd he said, [in Spanish] "A girlfriend?!?"
p176
aVAnd she set down her fork, and locked eyes with him,
p177
aVand said, [in Spanish] "Yes, a girlfriend. That is all."
p178
aVAnd his smug smile quickly dropped to one of maternal respect,
p179
aVgrabbed his plate, walked off, went back to work.
p180
aVShe never made eye contact with me.
p181
aVShe left, did the same thing \u2014
p182
aVit was a 10-second conversation, such a short interaction.
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd on paper, she had so much more in common with him:
p185
aVlanguage, culture, history, family, her community was her lifeline here,
p186
aVbut her moral compass trumped all of that.
p187
aVAnd a little bit later, they were joking around in the kitchen in Spanish,
p188
aVthat had nothing to do with me,
p189
aVand that is duality.
p190
aVShe didn't have to choose some P.C. stance on gayness over her heritage.
p191
aVShe didn't have to choose her family over our friendship.
p192
aVIt wasn't Jesus or Ash.
p193
aV(Laughter)
p194
aV(Applause)
p195
aa(lp196
VHer individual morality was so strongly rooted
p197
aVthat she had the courage to hold both things.
p198
aVOur moral integrity is our responsibility
p199
aVand we must be prepared to defend it even when it's not convenient.
p200
aVThat's what it means to be an ally, and if you're going to be an ally,
p201
aVyou have to be an active ally:
p202
aVAsk questions, act when you hear something inappropriate,
p203
aVactually engage.
p204
aa(lp205
VI had a family friend who for years used to call my girlfriend my lover.
p206
aVReally? Lover?
p207
aVSo overly sexual,
p208
aVso '70s gay porn.
p209
aV(Laughter)
p210
aVBut she was trying, and she asked.
p211
aVShe could have called her my friend,
p212
aVor my "friend," or my "special friend" \u2014
p213
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p214
aVor even worse, just not asked at all.
p215
aVBelieve me, we would rather have you ask.
p216
aVI would rather have her say lover, than say nothing at all.
p217
aa(lp218
VPeople often say to me, "Well, Ash, I don't care.
p219
aVI don't see race or religion or sexuality.
p220
aVIt doesn't matter to me. I don't see it."
p221
aVBut I think the opposite of homophobia and racism and xenophobia is not love,
p222
aVit's apathy.
p223
aVIf you don't see my gayness, then you don't see me.
p224
aVIf it doesn't matter to you who I sleep with,
p225
aVthen you cannot imagine what it feels like
p226
aVwhen I walk down the street late at night holding her hand,
p227
aVand approach a group of people and have to make the decision
p228
aVif I should hang on to it or if I should I drop it
p229
aVwhen all I want to do is squeeze it tighter.
p230
aVAnd the small victory I feel
p231
aVwhen I make it by and don't have to let go.
p232
aVAnd the incredible cowardice and disappointment I feel when I drop it.
p233
aVIf you do not see that struggle
p234
aVthat is unique to my human experience because I am gay, then you don't see me.
p235
aVIf you are going to be an ally, I need you to see me.
p236
aa(lp237
VAs individuals, as allies, as humans,
p238
aVwe need to be able to hold both things:
p239
aVboth the good and the bad,
p240
aVthe easy and the hard.
p241
aVYou don't learn how to hold two things just from the fluff,
p242
aVyou learn it from the grit.
p243
aVAnd what if duality is just the first step?
p244
aVWhat if through compassion and empathy and human interaction
p245
aVwe are able to learn to hold two things?
p246
aVAnd if we can hold two things, we can hold four,
p247
aVand if we can hold four, we can hold eight,
p248
aVand if we can hold eight, we can hold hundreds.
p249
aa(lp250
VWe are complex individuals,
p251
aVswirls of contradiction.
p252
aVYou are all holding so many things right now.
p253
aVWhat can you do to hold just a few more?
p254
aa(lp255
VSo, back to Toledo, Ohio.
p256
aVI'm at the front of the line,
p257
aVniece on my shoulders, the frazzled clerk calls me Dad.
p258
aVHave you ever been mistaken for the wrong gender?
p259
aVNot even that.
p260
aVHave you ever been called something you are not?
p261
aVHere's what it feels like for me:
p262
aVI am instantly an internal storm of contrasting emotions.
p263
aVI break out into a sweat that is a combination of rage and humiliation,
p264
aVI feel like the entire store is staring at me,
p265
aVand I simultaneously feel invisible.
p266
aVI want to explode in a tirade of fury,
p267
aVand I want to crawl under a rock.
p268
aVAnd top all of that off with the frustration that I'm wearing
p269
aVan out-of-character tight-fitting purple t-shirt,
p270
aVso this whole store can see my boobs,
p271
aVto make sure this exact same thing doesn't happen.
p272
aV(Laughter)
p273
aVBut, despite my best efforts to be seen as the gender I am,
p274
aVit still happens.
p275
aVAnd I hope with every ounce of my body that no one heard \u2014
p276
aVnot my sister, not my girlfriend, and certainly not my niece.
p277
aVI am accustomed to this familiar hurt,
p278
aVbut I will do whatever I need to do to protect the people I love from it.
p279
aa(lp280
VBut then I take my niece off my shoulders,
p281
aVand she runs to Elsa and Anna \u2014
p282
aVthe thing she's been waiting so long for \u2014
p283
aVand all that stuff goes away.
p284
aVAll that matters is the smile on her face.
p285
aVAnd as the 30 seconds we waited two and a half hours for comes to a close
p286
aVwe gather up our things, and I lock eyes with the clerk again;
p287
aVand she gives me an apologetic smile and mouths,
p288
aV"I am so sorry!"
p289
aV(Laughter)
p290
aVAnd her humanity, her willingness to admit her mistake disarms me immediately,
p291
aVthen I give her a: "It's okay, it happens. But thanks."
p292
aa(lp293
VAnd I realize in that moment
p294
aVthat I don't have to be
p295
aVeither an aunt or an advocate, I can be both.
p296
aVI can live in duality, and I can hold two things.
p297
aVAnd if I can hold two things in that environment,
p298
aVI can hold so many more things.
p299
aVAs my girlfriend and my niece hold hands and skip out the front of the door,
p300
aVI turn to my sister and say, "Was it worth it?"
p301
aVAnd she said, "Are you kidding me?
p302
aVDid you see the look on her face? This was the greatest day of her life!"
p303
aV(Laughter)
p304
aV"It was worth the two and a half hours in the heat,
p305
aVit was worth the overpriced coloring book that we already had a copy of."
p306
aV(Laughter)
p307
aV"It was even worth you  getting called Dad."
p308
aV(Laughter)
p309
aVAnd for the first time ever in my life, it actually was.
p310
aa(lp311
VThank you, Boulder. Have a good night.

VContagious is a good word.
p5
aVEven in the times of H1N1, I like the word.
p6
aVLaughter is contagious. Passion is contagious.
p7
aVInspiration is contagious.
p8
aVWe've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers.
p9
aVBut for me, what was contagious about all of them
p10
aVwas that they were infected by something I call the
p11
aV"I Can" bug.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo, the question is, why only them?
p14
aVIn a country of a billion people and some,
p15
aVwhy so few?
p16
aVIs it luck? Is it chance?
p17
aVCan we all not systematically and consciously
p18
aVget infected?
p19
aVSo, in the next eight minutes I would like to share with you my story.
p20
aVI got infected when I was 17,
p21
aVwhen, as a student of the design college,
p22
aVI encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas,
p23
aVchallenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me.
p24
aVAnd I was struck by just how wonderful it felt,
p25
aVand how contagious that feeling was.
p26
aVI also realized I should have got infected when I was seven.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo, when I started Riverside school 10 years ago it became a lab,
p29
aVa lab to prototype and refine a design process
p30
aVthat could consciously infect the mind with the "I Can" bug.
p31
aVAnd I uncovered
p32
aVthat if learning is embedded in real-world context,
p33
aVthat if you blur the boundaries between school and life,
p34
aVthen children go through a journey of "aware,"
p35
aVwhere they can see the change,
p36
aV"enable," be changed,
p37
aVand then "empower," lead the change.
p38
aVAnd that directly increased student wellbeing.
p39
aVChildren became more competent,
p40
aVand less helpless.
p41
aVBut this was all common sense.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo, I'd like to show you a little glimpse of what
p44
aVcommon practice looks like at Riverside.
p45
aVA little background: when my grade five was learning about child rights,
p46
aVthey were made to roll incense sticks,
p47
aVagarbattis, for eight hours
p48
aVto experience what it means to be a child laborer.
p49
aVIt transformed them. What you will see is their journey,
p50
aVand then their utter conviction
p51
aVthat they could go out and change the world.
p52
aV(Music)
p53
aa(lp54
VThat's them rolling.
p55
aVAnd in two hours, after their backs were broke,
p56
aVthey were changed.
p57
aVAnd once that happened,
p58
aVthey were out in the city convincing everybody
p59
aVthat child labor just had to be abolished.
p60
aVAnd look at Ragav, that moment when his face changes
p61
aVbecause he's been able to understand that he
p62
aVhas shifted that man's mindset.
p63
aVAnd that can't happen in a classroom.
p64
aVSo, when Ragav experienced that
p65
aVhe went from "teacher told me,"
p66
aVto "I am doing it." And that's the "I Can" mindshift.
p67
aVAnd it is a process that can be energized and nurtured.
p68
aa(lp69
VBut we had parents who said,
p70
aV"Okay, making our children good human beings is all very well,
p71
aVbut what about math and science and English?
p72
aVShow us the grades."
p73
aVAnd we did. The data was conclusive.
p74
aVWhen children are empowered,
p75
aVnot only do they do good,
p76
aVthey do well, in fact very well,
p77
aVas you can see in this national benchmarking assessment
p78
aVtaken by over 2,000 schools in India,
p79
aVRiverside children were outperforming the top 10 schools in India
p80
aVin math, English and science.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo, it worked. It was now time to take it outside Riverside.
p83
aVSo, on August 15th, Independence Day, 2007,
p84
aVthe children of Riverside set out to infect Ahmedabad.
p85
aVNow it was not about Riverside school.
p86
aVIt was about all children. So, we were shameless.
p87
aVWe walked into the offices of the municipal corporation, the police,
p88
aVthe press, businesses,
p89
aVand basically said, "When are you going to wake up
p90
aVand recognize the potential that resides in every child?
p91
aVWhen will you include the child in the city?
p92
aVBasically, open your hearts and your minds to the child."
p93
aa(lp94
VSo, how did the city respond?
p95
aVSince 2007 every other month
p96
aVthe city closes down the busiest streets for traffic
p97
aVand converts it into a playground for children and childhood.
p98
aVHere was a city telling its child, "You can."
p99
aVA glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad.
p100
aVVideo: [Unclear]
p101
aVSo, the busiest streets closed down.
p102
aVWe have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us.
p103
aVIt gets taken over by children.
p104
aVThey are skating. They are doing street plays.
p105
aVThey are playing, all free, for all children.
p106
aV(Music)
p107
aa(lp108
VAtul Karwal: aProCh is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier.
p109
aVAnd we plan to extend this to other parts of the city.
p110
aV(Music)
p111
aa(lp112
VKiran Bir Sethi: And the city will give free time.
p113
aVAnd Ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world.
p114
aa(lp115
VGeet Sethi: When a city gives to the children,
p116
aVin the future the children will give back to the city.
p117
aV(Music)
p118
aa(lp119
VKBS: And because of that,
p120
aVAhmedabad is known as India's first child-friendly city.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo, you're getting the pattern. First 200 children at Riverside.
p123
aVThen 30,000 children in Ahmedabad, and growing.
p124
aVIt was time now to infect India.
p125
aVSo, on August 15th,
p126
aVagain, Independence Day, 2009,
p127
aVempowered with the same process,
p128
aVwe empowered 100,000 children to say, "I can."
p129
aVHow? We designed a simple toolkit,
p130
aVconverted it into eight languages,
p131
aVand reached 32,000 schools.
p132
aVWe basically gave children a very simple challenge.
p133
aVWe said, take one idea,
p134
aVanything that bothers you,
p135
aVchoose one week,
p136
aVand change a billion lives.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd they did. Stories of change
p139
aVpoured in from all over India,
p140
aVfrom Nagaland in the east,
p141
aVto Jhunjhunu in the west,
p142
aVfrom Sikkim in the north, to Krishnagiri in the south.
p143
aVChildren were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems.
p144
aVRight from loneliness to filling potholes in the street
p145
aVto alcoholism,
p146
aVand 32 children who stopped 16 child marriages
p147
aVin Rajasthan.
p148
aVI mean, it was incredible.
p149
aVBasically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children
p150
aVand say, "You can," then they will.
p151
aVInfection in India.
p152
aVThis is in Rajasthan, a rural village.
p153
aa(lp154
VChild: Our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write.
p155
aVKBS: First time, a rally and a street play in a rural school \u2014
p156
aVunheard of \u2014 to tell their parents why literacy is important.
p157
aVLook at what their parents says.
p158
aa(lp159
VMan: This program is wonderful.
p160
aVWe feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write.
p161
aa(lp162
VWoman: I am so happy that my students did this campaign.
p163
aVIn the future, I will never doubt my students' abilities.
p164
aVSee? They have done it.
p165
aa(lp166
VKBS: An inner city school in Hyderabad.
p167
aVGirl: 581. This house is 581 ...
p168
aa(lp169
VWe have to start collecting from 555.
p170
aa(lp171
VKBS: Girls and boys in Hyderabad, going out,
p172
aVpretty difficult, but they did it.
p173
aa(lp174
VWoman: Even though they are so young, they have done such good work.
p175
aVFirst they have cleaned the society, then it will be Hyderabad, and soon India.
p176
aa(lp177
VWoman: It was a revelation for me. It doesn't strike me
p178
aVthat they had so much inside them.
p179
aa(lp180
VGirl: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
p181
aVFor our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you,
p182
aVfor a very good cause,
p183
aVthe money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids.
p184
aVAre you ready, ladies and gentlemen? Audience: Yes!
p185
aVGirl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes!
p186
aVGirl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes!
p187
aa(lp188
VKBS: So, the charter of compassion starts right here.
p189
aVStreet plays, auctions, petitions.
p190
aVI mean, they were changing lives.
p191
aVIt was incredible.
p192
aVSo, how can we still stay immune?
p193
aVHow can we stay immune to that passion, that energy, that excitement?
p194
aVI know it's obvious,
p195
aVbut I have to end with the most powerful symbol of change, Gandhiji.
p196
aV70 years ago, it took one man
p197
aVto infect an entire nation
p198
aVwith the power of "We can."
p199
aa(lp200
VSo, today who is it going to take
p201
aVto spread the infection from 100,000 children
p202
aVto the 200 million children in India?
p203
aVLast I heard, the preamble still said, "We, the people of India," right?
p204
aVSo, if not us, then who?
p205
aVIf not now, then when?
p206
aVLike I said, contagious is a good word.
p207
aVThank you.
p208
aV(Applause)

VIn the year 1919,
p5
aVa virtually unknown German mathematician, named Theodor Kaluza
p6
aVsuggested a very bold and, in some ways, a very bizarre idea.
p7
aVHe proposed that our universe
p8
aVmight actually have more than the three dimensions
p9
aVthat we are all aware of.
p10
aVThat is in addition to left, right, back, forth and up, down,
p11
aVKaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space
p12
aVthat for some reason we don't yet see.
p13
aVNow, when someone makes a bold and bizarre idea,
p14
aVsometimes that's all it is \u2014 bold and bizarre,
p15
aVbut it has nothing to do with the world around us.
p16
aVThis particular idea, however \u2014
p17
aValthough we don't yet know whether it's right or wrong,
p18
aVand at the end I'll discuss experiments which, in the next few years,
p19
aVmay tell us whether it's right or wrong \u2014
p20
aVthis idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century
p21
aVand continues to inform a lot of cutting-edge research.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo, I'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions.
p24
aVSo where do we go?
p25
aVTo begin we need a little bit of back story. Go to 1907.
p26
aVThis is a year when Einstein is basking in the glow
p27
aVof having discovered the special theory of relativity
p28
aVand decides to take on a new project,
p29
aVto try to understand fully the grand, pervasive force of gravity.
p30
aVAnd in that moment, there are many people around
p31
aVwho thought that that project had already been resolved.
p32
aVNewton had given the world a theory of gravity in the late 1600s
p33
aVthat works well, describes the motion of planets,
p34
aVthe motion of the moon and so forth,
p35
aVthe motion of apocryphal of apples falling from trees,
p36
aVhitting people on the head.
p37
aVAll of that could be described using Newton's work.
p38
aa(lp39
VBut Einstein realized that Newton had left something out of the story,
p40
aVbecause even Newton had written
p41
aVthat although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity,
p42
aVhe'd been unable to figure out how it really works.
p43
aVHow is it that the Sun, 93 million miles away,
p44
aV[that] somehow it affects the motion of the Earth?
p45
aVHow does the Sun reach out across empty inert space and exert influence?
p46
aVAnd that is a task to which Einstein set himself \u2014
p47
aVto figure out how gravity works.
p48
aVAnd let me show you what it is that he found.
p49
aVSo Einstein found
p50
aVthat the medium that transmits gravity is space itself.
p51
aVThe idea goes like this:
p52
aVimagine space is a substrate of all there is.
p53
aa(lp54
VEinstein said space is nice and flat, if there's no matter present.
p55
aVBut if there is matter in the environment, such as the Sun,
p56
aVit causes the fabric of space to warp, to curve.
p57
aVAnd that communicates the force of gravity.
p58
aVEven the Earth warps space around it.
p59
aVNow look at the Moon.
p60
aVThe Moon is kept in orbit, according to these ideas,
p61
aVbecause it rolls along a valley in the curved environment
p62
aVthat the Sun and the Moon and the Earth can all create by virtue of their presence.
p63
aVWe go to a full-frame view of this.
p64
aVThe Earth itself is kept in orbit
p65
aVbecause it rolls along a valley in the environment that's curved
p66
aVbecause of the Sun's presence.
p67
aVThat is this new idea about how gravity actually works.
p68
aa(lp69
VNow, this idea was tested in 1919 through astronomical observations.
p70
aVIt really works. It describes the data.
p71
aVAnd this gained Einstein prominence around the world.
p72
aVAnd that is what got Kaluza thinking.
p73
aVHe, like Einstein, was in search of what we call a unified theory.
p74
aVThat's one theory
p75
aVthat might be able to describe all of nature's forces from one set of ideas,
p76
aVone set of principles, one master equation, if you will.
p77
aVSo Kaluza said to himself,
p78
aVEinstein has been able to describe gravity
p79
aVin terms of warps and curves in space \u2014
p80
aVin fact, space and time, to be more precise.
p81
aVMaybe I can play the same game with the other known force,
p82
aVwhich was, at that time, known as the electromagnetic force \u2014
p83
aVwe know of others today, but at that time
p84
aVthat was the only other one people were thinking about.
p85
aVYou know, the force responsible for electricity
p86
aVand magnetic attraction and so forth.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo Kaluza says, maybe I can play the same game
p89
aVand describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves.
p90
aVThat raised a question: warps and curves in what?
p91
aVEinstein had already used up space and time,
p92
aVwarps and curves, to describe gravity.
p93
aVThere didn't seem to be anything else to warp or curve.
p94
aVSo Kaluza said, well, maybe there are more dimensions of space.
p95
aVHe said, if I want to describe one more force,
p96
aVmaybe I need one more dimension.
p97
aVSo he imagined that the world had four dimensions of space, not three,
p98
aVand imagined that electromagnetism was warps and curves
p99
aVin that fourth dimension. Now here's the thing:
p100
aVwhen he wrote down the equations describing warps and curves
p101
aVin a universe with four space dimensions, not three,
p102
aVhe found the old equations that Einstein had already derived in three dimensions \u2014
p103
aVthose were for gravity \u2014
p104
aVbut he found one more equation because of the one more dimension.
p105
aVAnd when he looked at that equation,
p106
aVit was none other than the equation
p107
aVthat scientists had long known to describe the electromagnetic force.
p108
aVAmazing \u2014 it just popped out.
p109
aVHe was so excited by this realization
p110
aVthat he ran around his house screaming, "Victory!" \u2014
p111
aVthat he had found the unified theory.
p112
aa(lp113
VNow clearly, Kaluza was a man who took theory very seriously.
p114
aVHe, in fact \u2014
p115
aVthere is a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim,
p116
aVhe read a book, a treatise on swimming \u2014
p117
aV(Laughter)
p118
aV\u2014 then dove into the ocean.
p119
aVThis is a man who would risk his life on theory.
p120
aVNow, but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded,
p121
aVtwo questions immediately arise from his observation.
p122
aVNumber one: if there are more dimensions in space, where are they?
p123
aVWe don't seem to see them.
p124
aVAnd number two: does this theory really work in detail,
p125
aVwhen you try to apply it to the world around us?
p126
aVNow, the first question was answered in 1926
p127
aVby a fellow named Oskar Klein.
p128
aVHe suggested that dimensions might come in two varieties \u2014
p129
aVthere might be big, easy-to-see dimensions,
p130
aVbut there might also be tiny, curled-up dimensions,
p131
aVcurled up so small, even though they're all around us,
p132
aVthat we don't see them.
p133
aa(lp134
VLet me show you that one visually.
p135
aVSo, imagine you're looking at something
p136
aVlike a cable supporting a traffic light.
p137
aVIt's in Manhattan. You're in Central Park \u2014 it's kind of irrelevant \u2014
p138
aVbut the cable looks one-dimensional from a distant viewpoint,
p139
aVbut you and I all know that it does have some thickness.
p140
aVIt's very hard to see it, though, from far away.
p141
aVBut if we zoom in and take the perspective of, say,
p142
aVa little ant walking around \u2014
p143
aVlittle ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions \u2014
p144
aVthe long dimension,
p145
aVbut also this clockwise, counter-clockwise direction.
p146
aVAnd I hope you appreciate this.
p147
aVIt took so long to get these ants to do this.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VBut this illustrates the fact that dimensions can be of two sorts:
p152
aVbig and small. And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us
p153
aVare the ones that we can easily see,
p154
aVbut there might be additional dimensions curled up,
p155
aVsort of like the circular part of that cable,
p156
aVso small that they have so far remained invisible.
p157
aVLet me show you what that would look like.
p158
aVSo, if we take a look, say, at space itself \u2014
p159
aVI can only show, of course, two dimensions on a screen.
p160
aVSome of you guys will fix that one day,
p161
aVbut anything that's not flat on a screen is a new dimension,
p162
aVgoes smaller, smaller, smaller,
p163
aVand way down in the microscopic depths of space itself,
p164
aVthis is the idea,
p165
aVyou could have additional curled up dimensions \u2014
p166
aa(lp167
Vhere is a little shape of a circle \u2014 so small that we don't see them.
p168
aVBut if you were a little ultra microscopic ant walking around,
p169
aVyou could walk in the big dimensions that we all know about \u2014
p170
aVthat's like the grid part \u2014
p171
aVbut you could also access the tiny curled-up dimension
p172
aVthat's so small that we can't see it with the naked eye
p173
aVor even with any of our most refined equipment.
p174
aVBut deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself,
p175
aVthe idea is there could be more dimensions, as we see there.
p176
aVNow that's an explanation
p177
aVabout how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see.
p178
aVBut what about the second question that I asked:
p179
aVdoes the theory actually work
p180
aVwhen you try to apply it to the real world?
p181
aa(lp182
VWell, it turns out that Einstein and Kaluza and many others
p183
aVworked on trying to refine this framework
p184
aVand apply it to the physics of the universe
p185
aVas was understood at the time, and, in detail, it didn't work.
p186
aVIn detail, for instance,
p187
aVthey couldn't get the mass of the electron
p188
aVto work out correctly in this theory.
p189
aVSo many people worked on it, but by the '40s, certainly by the '50s,
p190
aVthis strange but very compelling idea
p191
aVof how to unify the laws of physics had gone away.
p192
aVUntil something wonderful happened in our age.
p193
aVIn our era, a new approach to unify the laws of physics
p194
aVis being pursued by physicists such as myself,
p195
aVmany others around the world,
p196
aVit's called superstring theory, as you were indicating.
p197
aVAnd the wonderful thing is that superstring theory
p198
aVhas nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions,
p199
aVbut when we study superstring theory,
p200
aVwe find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling, new form.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo, let me just tell you how that goes.
p203
aVSuperstring theory \u2014 what is it?
p204
aVWell, it's a theory that tries to answer the question:
p205
aVwhat are the basic, fundamental, indivisible, uncuttable constituents
p206
aVmaking up everything in the world around us?
p207
aVThe idea is like this.
p208
aVSo, imagine we look at a familiar object, just a candle in a holder,
p209
aVand imagine that we want to figure out what it is made of.
p210
aVSo we go on a journey deep inside the object and examine the constituents.
p211
aVSo deep inside \u2014 we all know, you go sufficiently far down, you have atoms.
p212
aVWe also all know that atoms are not the end of the story.
p213
aVThey have little electrons that swarm around a central nucleus
p214
aVwith neutrons and protons.
p215
aVEven the neutrons and protons have smaller particles inside of them known as quarks.
p216
aVThat is where conventional ideas stop.
p217
aa(lp218
VHere is the new idea of string theory.
p219
aVDeep inside any of these particles, there is something else.
p220
aVThis something else is this dancing filament of energy.
p221
aVIt looks like a vibrating string \u2014
p222
aVthat's where the idea, string theory comes from.
p223
aVAnd just like the vibrating strings that you just saw in a cello
p224
aVcan vibrate in different patterns,
p225
aVthese can also vibrate in different patterns.
p226
aVThey don't produce different musical notes.
p227
aVRather, they produce the different particles making up the world around us.
p228
aVSo if these ideas are correct,
p229
aVthis is what the ultra-microscopic landscape of the universe looks like.
p230
aVIt's built up of a huge number
p231
aVof these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy,
p232
aVvibrating in different frequencies.
p233
aVThe different frequencies produce the different particles.
p234
aVThe different particles are responsible
p235
aVfor all the richness in the world around us.
p236
aa(lp237
VAnd there you see unification,
p238
aVbecause matter particles, electrons and quarks,
p239
aVradiation particles, photons, gravitons, are all built up from one entity.
p240
aVSo matter and the forces of nature all are put together
p241
aVunder the rubric of vibrating strings.
p242
aVAnd that's what we mean by a unified theory.
p243
aVNow here is the catch.
p244
aVWhen you study the mathematics of string theory,
p245
aVyou find that it doesn't work
p246
aVin a universe that just has three dimensions of space.
p247
aVIt doesn't work in a universe with four dimensions of space, nor five, nor six.
p248
aVFinally, you can study the equations, and show that it works
p249
aVonly in a universe that has 10 dimensions of space
p250
aVand one dimension of time.
p251
aVIt leads us right back to this idea of Kaluza and Klein \u2014
p252
aVthat our world, when appropriately described,
p253
aVhas more dimensions than the ones that we see.
p254
aa(lp255
VNow you might think about that and say, well,
p256
aVOK, you know, if you have extra dimensions, and they're really tightly curled up,
p257
aVyeah, perhaps we won't see them, if they're small enough.
p258
aVBut if there's a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there,
p259
aVand you make them small enough, and we won't see them either. That is true.
p260
aVOne of the other predictions of string theory \u2014
p261
aVno, that's not one of the other predictions of string theory.
p262
aa(lp263
V(Laughter)
p264
aa(lp265
VBut it raises the question:
p266
aVare we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions,
p267
aVor do they tell us something about the world?
p268
aVIn the remaining time, I'd like to tell you two features of them.
p269
aVFirst is, many of us believe that these extra dimensions
p270
aVhold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question
p271
aVin theoretical physics, theoretical science.
p272
aVAnd that question is this: when we look around the world,
p273
aVas scientists have done for the last hundred years,
p274
aVthere appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe.
p275
aVThese are numbers like the mass of the particles,
p276
aVlike electrons and quarks, the strength of gravity,
p277
aVthe strength of the electromagnetic force \u2014
p278
aVa list of about 20 numbers
p279
aVthat have been measured with incredible precision,
p280
aVbut nobody has an explanation
p281
aVfor why the numbers have the particular values that they do.
p282
aa(lp283
VNow, does string theory offer an answer?
p284
aVNot yet.
p285
aVBut we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do
p286
aVmay rely on the form of the extra dimensions.
p287
aVAnd the wonderful thing is, if those numbers
p288
aVhad any other values than the known ones,
p289
aVthe universe, as we know it, wouldn't exist.
p290
aVThis is a deep question.
p291
aVWhy are those numbers so finely tuned
p292
aVto allow stars to shine and planets to form,
p293
aVwhen we recognize that if you fiddle with those numbers \u2014
p294
aVif I had 20 dials up here
p295
aVand I let you come up and fiddle with those numbers,
p296
aValmost any fiddling makes the universe disappear.
p297
aVSo can we explain those 20 numbers?
p298
aVAnd string theory suggests that those 20 numbers
p299
aVhave to do with the extra dimensions.
p300
aVLet me show you how.
p301
aVSo when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory,
p302
aVit's not one extra dimension,
p303
aVas in the older ideas of Kaluza and Klein.
p304
aVThis is what string theory says about the extra dimensions.
p305
aVThey have a very rich, intertwined geometry.
p306
aa(lp307
VThis is an example of something known as a Calabi-Yau shape \u2014
p308
aVname isn't all that important.
p309
aVBut, as you can see,
p310
aVthe extra dimensions fold in on themselves
p311
aVand intertwine in a very interesting shape, interesting structure.
p312
aVAnd the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like,
p313
aVthen the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us
p314
aVwould look like this on the tiniest of scales.
p315
aVWhen you swing your hand,
p316
aVyou'd be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again,
p317
aVbut they're so small that we wouldn't know it.
p318
aVSo what is the physical implication, though, relevant to those 20 numbers?
p319
aa(lp320
VConsider this. If you look at the instrument, a French horn,
p321
aVnotice that the vibrations of the airstreams
p322
aVare affected by the shape of the instrument.
p323
aVNow in string theory,
p324
aVall the numbers are reflections of the way strings can vibrate.
p325
aVSo just as those airstreams
p326
aVare affected by the twists and turns in the instrument,
p327
aVstrings themselves will be affected
p328
aVby the vibrational patterns in the geometry within which they are moving.
p329
aVSo let me bring some strings into the story.
p330
aVAnd if you watch these little fellows vibrating around \u2014
p331
aVthey'll be there in a second \u2014 right there,
p332
aVnotice that they way they vibrate is affected
p333
aVby the geometry of the extra dimensions.
p334
aa(lp335
VSo, if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like \u2014
p336
aVwe don't yet, but if we did \u2014
p337
aVwe should be able to calculate the allowed notes,
p338
aVthe allowed vibrational patterns.
p339
aVAnd if we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns,
p340
aVwe should be able to calculate those 20 numbers.
p341
aVAnd if the answer that we get from our calculations
p342
aVagrees with the values of those numbers
p343
aVthat have been determined
p344
aVthrough detailed and precise experimentation,
p345
aVthis in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation
p346
aVfor why the structure of the universe is the way it is.
p347
aVNow, the second issue that I want to finish up with is:
p348
aVhow might we test for these extra dimensions more directly?
p349
aVIs this just an interesting mathematical structure
p350
aVthat might be able to explain
p351
aVsome previously unexplained features of the world,
p352
aVor can we actually test for these extra dimensions?
p353
aVAnd we think \u2014 and this is, I think, very exciting \u2014
p354
aVthat in the next five years or so we may be able to test
p355
aVfor the existence of these extra dimensions.
p356
aa(lp357
VHere's how it goes. In CERN, Geneva, Switzerland,
p358
aVa machine is being built called the Large Hadron Collider.
p359
aVIt's a machine that will send particles around a tunnel,
p360
aVopposite directions, near the speed of light.
p361
aVEvery so often those particles will be aimed at each other,
p362
aVso there's a head-on collision.
p363
aVThe hope is that if the collision has enough energy,
p364
aVit may eject some of the debris from the collision
p365
aVfrom our dimensions, forcing it to enter into the other dimensions.
p366
aVHow would we know it?
p367
aVWell, we'll measure the amount of energy after the collision,
p368
aVcompare it to the amount of energy before,
p369
aVand if there's less energy after the collision than before,
p370
aVthis will be evidence that the energy has drifted away.
p371
aVAnd if it drifts away in the right pattern that we can calculate,
p372
aVthis will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there.
p373
aa(lp374
VLet me show you that idea visually.
p375
aVSo, imagine we have a certain kind of particle called a graviton \u2014
p376
aVthat's the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out,
p377
aVif the extra dimensions are real.
p378
aVBut here's how the experiment will go.
p379
aVYou take these particles. You slam them together.
p380
aVYou slam them together, and if we are right,
p381
aVsome of the energy of that collision
p382
aVwill go into debris that flies off into these extra dimensions.
p383
aVSo this is the kind of experiment
p384
aVthat we'll be looking at in the next five, seven to 10 years or so.
p385
aVAnd if this experiment bears fruit,
p386
aVif we see that kind of particle ejected
p387
aVby noticing that there's less energy in our dimensions
p388
aVthan when we began,
p389
aVthis will show that the extra dimensions are real.
p390
aa(lp391
VAnd to me this is a really remarkable story,
p392
aVand a remarkable opportunity. Going back to Newton with absolute space \u2014
p393
aVdidn't provide anything but an arena, a stage
p394
aVin which the events of the universe take place.
p395
aVEinstein comes along and says,
p396
aVwell, space and time can warp and curve \u2014 that's what gravity is.
p397
aVAnd now string theory comes along and says,
p398
aVyes, gravity, quantum mechanics, electromagnetism,
p399
aVall together in one package,
p400
aVbut only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see.
p401
aVAnd this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime.
p402
aVAmazing possibility.
p403
aVThank you very much.

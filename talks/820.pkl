VSo the first robot to talk about is called STriDER.
p5
aVIt stands for Self-excited Tripedal Dynamic Experimental Robot.
p6
aVIt's a robot that has three legs, which is inspired by nature.
p7
aVBut have you seen anything in nature, an animal that has three legs?
p8
aVProbably not. So why do I call this a biologically inspired robot?
p9
aVHow would it work?
p10
aVBut before that, let's look at pop culture.
p11
aVSo, you know H.G. Wells's "War of the Worlds," novel and movie.
p12
aVAnd what you see over here is a very popular video game,
p13
aVand in this fiction, they describe these alien creatures and robots
p14
aVthat have three legs that terrorize Earth.
p15
aVBut my robot, STriDER, does not move like this.
p16
aa(lp17
VThis is an actual dynamic simulation animation.
p18
aVI'm going to show you how the robot works.
p19
aVIt flips its body 180 degrees
p20
aVand it swings its leg between the two legs
p21
aVand catches the fall.
p22
aVSo that's how it walks.
p23
aVBut when you look at us human beings, bipedal walking,
p24
aVwhat you're doing is,
p25
aVyou're not really using muscle to lift your leg and walk like a robot.
p26
aVWhat you're doing is, you swing your leg and catch the fall,
p27
aVstand up again, swing your leg and catch the fall.
p28
aVYou're using your built-in dynamics, the physics of your body,
p29
aVjust like a pendulum.
p30
aVWe call that the concept of passive dynamic locomotion.
p31
aVWhat you're doing is, when you stand up,
p32
aVpotential energy to kinetic energy,
p33
aVpotential energy to kinetic energy.
p34
aVIt's a constantly falling process.
p35
aVSo even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this,
p36
aVreally, we're inspired by biology and applying the principles of walking
p37
aVto this robot.
p38
aVThus, it's a biologically inspired robot.
p39
aa(lp40
VWhat you see here, this is what we want to do next.
p41
aVWe want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long-range motion.
p42
aVAnd it deploys legs \u2014 it looks almost like "Star Wars" \u2014
p43
aVso when it lands, it absorbs the shock and starts walking.
p44
aVWhat you see over here, this yellow thing, this is not a death ray.
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VThis is just to show you
p49
aVthat if you have cameras or different types of sensors,
p50
aVbecause it's 1.8 meters tall,
p51
aVyou can see over obstacles like bushes and those kinds of things.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo we have two prototypes.
p54
aVThe first version, in the back, that's STriDER I.
p55
aVThe one in front, the smaller, is STriDER II.
p56
aVThe problem we had with STriDER I is, it was just too heavy in the body.
p57
aVWe had so many motors aligning the joints
p58
aVand those kinds of things.
p59
aVSo we decided to synthesize a mechanical mechanism
p60
aVso we could get rid of all the motors, and with a single motor,
p61
aVwe can coordinate all the motions.
p62
aVIt's a mechanical solution to a problem, instead of using mechatronics.
p63
aVSo with this, now the top body is lighted up; it's walking in our lab.
p64
aVThis was the very first successful step.
p65
aVIt's still not perfected, its coffee falls down,
p66
aVso we still have a lot of work to do.
p67
aa(lp68
VThe second robot I want to talk about is called IMPASS.
p69
aVIt stands for Intelligent Mobility Platform with Actuated Spoke System.
p70
aVIt's a wheel-leg hybrid robot.
p71
aVSo think of a rimless wheel or a spoke wheel,
p72
aVbut the spokes individually move in and out of the hub;
p73
aVso, it's a wheel-leg hybrid.
p74
aVWe're literally reinventing the wheel here.
p75
aVLet me demonstrate how it works.
p76
aVSo in this video we're using an approach called the reactive approach.
p77
aVJust simply using the tactile sensors on the feet,
p78
aVit's trying to walk over a changing terrain,
p79
aVa soft terrain where it pushes down and changes.
p80
aVAnd just by the tactile information,
p81
aVit successfully crosses over these types of terrains.
p82
aa(lp83
VBut, when it encounters a very extreme terrain \u2014
p84
aVin this case, this obstacle is more than three times the height
p85
aVof the robot \u2014
p86
aVthen it switches to a deliberate mode,
p87
aVwhere it uses a laser range finder and camera systems
p88
aVto identify the obstacle and the size.
p89
aVAnd it carefully plans the motion of the spokes
p90
aVand coordinates it so it can show this very impressive mobility.
p91
aVYou probably haven't seen anything like this out there.
p92
aVThis is a very high-mobility robot that we developed called IMPASS.
p93
aVAh, isn't that cool?
p94
aa(lp95
VWhen you drive your car,
p96
aVwhen you steer your car, you use a method called Ackermann steering.
p97
aVThe front wheels rotate like this.
p98
aVFor most small-wheeled robots,
p99
aVthey use a method called differential steering
p100
aVwhere the left and right wheel turn the opposite direction.
p101
aVFor IMPASS, we can do many, many different types of motion.
p102
aVFor example, in this case,
p103
aVeven though the left and right wheels are connected
p104
aVwith a single axle rotating at the same angle of velocity,
p105
aVwe simply change the length of the spoke, it affects the diameter,
p106
aVthen can turn to the left and to the right.
p107
aVThese are just some examples of the neat things we can do with IMPASS.
p108
aa(lp109
VThis robot is called CLIMBeR:
p110
aVCable-suspended Limbed Intelligent Matching Behavior Robot.
p111
aVI've been talking to a lot of NASA JPL scientists \u2014
p112
aVat JPL, they are famous for the Mars rovers \u2014
p113
aVand the scientists, geologists always tell me
p114
aVthat the real interesting science, the science-rich sites,
p115
aVare always at the cliffs.
p116
aVBut the current rovers cannot get there.
p117
aVSo, inspired by that, we wanted to build a robot
p118
aVthat can climb a structured cliff environment.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo this is CLIMBeR.
p121
aVIt has three legs.
p122
aVIt's probably difficult to see, but it has a winch and a cable at the top.
p123
aVIt tries to figure out the best place to put its foot.
p124
aVAnd then once it figures that out,
p125
aVin real time, it calculates the force distribution:
p126
aVhow much force it needs to exert to the surface
p127
aVso it doesn't tip and doesn't slip.
p128
aVOnce it stabilizes that, it lifts a foot,
p129
aVand then with the winch, it can climb up these kinds of cliffs.
p130
aVAlso for search and rescue applications as well.
p131
aa(lp132
VFive years ago, I actually worked at NASA JPL
p133
aVduring the summer as a faculty fellow.
p134
aVAnd they already had a six-legged robot called LEMUR.
p135
aVSo this is actually based on that.
p136
aVThis robot is called MARS:
p137
aVMulti-Appendage Robotic System.
p138
aVIt's a hexapod robot.
p139
aVWe developed our adaptive gait planner.
p140
aVWe actually have a very interesting payload on there.
p141
aVThe students like to have fun.
p142
aVAnd here you can see that it's walking over unstructured terrain.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Motor sound)
p145
aa(lp146
VIt's trying to walk on the coastal terrain, a sandy area,
p147
aVbut depending on the moisture content or the grain size of the sand,
p148
aVthe foot's soil sinkage model changes, so it tries to adapt its gait
p149
aVto successfully cross over these kind of things.
p150
aVIt also does some fun stuff.
p151
aVAs you can imagine, we get so many visitors visiting our lab.
p152
aVSo when the visitors come, MARS walks up to the computer,
p153
aVstarts typing, "Hello, my name is MARS.
p154
aVWelcome to RoMeLa,
p155
aVthe Robotics Mechanisms Laboratory at Virginia Tech."
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VThis robot is an amoeba robot.
p160
aVNow, we don't have enough time to go into technical details,
p161
aVI'll just show you some of the experiments.
p162
aVThese are some of the early feasibility experiments.
p163
aVWe store potential energy to the elastic skin to make it move,
p164
aVor use active tension cords to make it move forward and backward.
p165
aVIt's called ChIMERA.
p166
aVWe also have been working with some scientists and engineers
p167
aVfrom UPenn
p168
aVto come up with a chemically actuated version of this amoeba robot.
p169
aVWe do something to something,
p170
aVand just like magic, it moves.
p171
aV"The Blob."
p172
aa(lp173
VThis robot is a very recent project.
p174
aVIt's called RAPHaEL:
p175
aVRobotic Air-Powered Hand with Elastic Ligaments.
p176
aVThere are a lot of really neat, very good robotic hands
p177
aVout there on the market.
p178
aVThe problem is, they're just too expensive \u2014
p179
aVtens of thousands of dollars.
p180
aVSo for prosthesis applications it's probably not too practical,
p181
aVbecause it's not affordable.
p182
aVWe wanted to tackle this problem in a very different direction.
p183
aVInstead of using electrical motors, electromechanical actuators,
p184
aVwe're using compressed air.
p185
aVWe developed these novel actuators for the joints, so it's compliant.
p186
aVYou can actually change the force,
p187
aVsimply just changing the air pressure.
p188
aVAnd it can actually crush an empty soda can.
p189
aVIt can pick up very delicate objects like a raw egg,
p190
aVor in this case, a lightbulb.
p191
aVThe best part: it took only 200 dollars to make the first prototype.
p192
aa(lp193
VThis robot is actually a family of snake robots
p194
aVthat we call HyDRAS,
p195
aVHyper Degrees-of-freedom Robotic Articulated Serpentine.
p196
aVThis is a robot that can climb structures.
p197
aVThis is a HyDRAS's arm.
p198
aVIt's a 12-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm.
p199
aVBut the cool part is the user interface.
p200
aVThe cable over there, that's an optical fiber.
p201
aVThis student, it's probably her first time using it,
p202
aVbut she can articulate it in many different ways.
p203
aVSo, for example, in Iraq, the war zone, there are roadside bombs.
p204
aVCurrently, you send these remotely controlled vehicles that are armed.
p205
aVIt takes really a lot of time and it's expensive to train the operator
p206
aVto operate this complex arm.
p207
aVIn this case, it's very intuitive;
p208
aVthis student, probably his first time using it,
p209
aVis doing very complex manipulation tasks,
p210
aVpicking up objects and doing manipulation, just like that.
p211
aVVery intuitive.
p212
aa(lp213
VNow, this robot is currently our star robot.
p214
aVWe actually have a fan club for the robot, DARwIn:
p215
aVDynamic Anthropomorphic Robot with Intelligence.
p216
aVAs you know, we're very interested in human walking,
p217
aVso we decided to build a small humanoid robot.
p218
aVThis was in 2004; at that time,
p219
aVthis was something really, really revolutionary.
p220
aVThis was more of a feasibility study:
p221
aVWhat kind of motors should we use? Is it even possible?
p222
aVWhat kinds of controls should we do?
p223
aVThis does not have any sensors, so it's an open-loop control.
p224
aVFor those who probably know, if you don't have any sensors
p225
aVand there's any disturbances, you know what happens.
p226
aa(lp227
V(Laughter)
p228
aa(lp229
VBased on that success, the following year we did the proper mechanical design,
p230
aVstarting from kinematics.
p231
aVAnd thus, DARwIn I was born in 2005.
p232
aVIt stands up, it walks \u2014 very impressive.
p233
aVHowever, still, as you can see, it has a cord, an umbilical cord.
p234
aVSo we're still using an external power source
p235
aVand external computation.
p236
aa(lp237
VSo in 2006, now it's really time to have fun.
p238
aVLet's give it intelligence.
p239
aVWe give it all the computing power it needs:
p240
aVa 1.5 gigahertz Pentium M chip, two FireWire cameras,
p241
aVrate gyros, accelerometers, four forced sensors on the foot,
p242
aVlithium polymer batteries \u2014
p243
aVand now DARwIn II is completely autonomous.
p244
aVIt is not remote controlled. There's no tethers.
p245
aVIt looks around, searches for the ball ... looks around, searches for the ball,
p246
aVand it tries to play a game of soccer autonomously \u2014 artificial intelligence.
p247
aVLet's see how it does.
p248
aVThis was our very first trial, and ...
p249
aa(lp250
V(Video) Spectators: Goal!
p251
aa(lp252
VDennis Hong: There is actually a competition called RoboCup.
p253
aVI don't know how many of you have heard about RoboCup.
p254
aVIt's an international autonomous robot soccer competition.
p255
aVAnd the actual goal of RoboCup is,
p256
aVby the year 2050,
p257
aVwe want to have full-size, autonomous humanoid robots
p258
aVplay soccer against the human World Cup champions
p259
aVand win.
p260
aa(lp261
V(Laughter)
p262
aa(lp263
VIt's a true, actual goal.
p264
aVIt's a very ambitious goal, but we truly believe we can do it.
p265
aa(lp266
VThis is last year in China.
p267
aVWe were the very first team in the United States that qualified
p268
aVin the humanoid RoboCup competition.
p269
aVThis is this year in Austria.
p270
aVYou're going to see the action is three against three,
p271
aVcompletely autonomous.
p272
aa(lp273
V(Video) (Crowd groans)
p274
aa(lp275
VDH: There you go. Yes!
p276
aVThe robots track and they team-play amongst themselves.
p277
aVIt's very impressive.
p278
aVIt's really a research event,
p279
aVpackaged in a more exciting competition event.
p280
aVWhat you see here is the beautiful Louis Vuitton Cup trophy.
p281
aVThis is for the best humanoid.
p282
aVWe'd like to bring this, for the first time, to the United States next year,
p283
aVso wish us luck.
p284
aa(lp285
V(Applause)
p286
aa(lp287
VThank you.
p288
aa(lp289
V(Applause)
p290
aa(lp291
VDARwIn also has a lot of other talents.
p292
aVLast year, it actually conducted the Roanoke Symphony Orchestra
p293
aVfor the holiday concert.
p294
aVThis is the next generation robot, DARwIn IV,
p295
aVmuch smarter, faster, stronger.
p296
aVAnd it's trying to show off its ability:
p297
aV"I'm macho, I'm strong."
p298
aa(lp299
V(Laughter)
p300
aa(lp301
V"I can also do some Jackie Chan-motion, martial art movements."
p302
aa(lp303
V(Laughter)
p304
aa(lp305
VAnd it walks away. So this is DARwIn IV.
p306
aVAgain, you'll be able to see it in the lobby.
p307
aVWe truly believe this will be the very first running humanoid robot
p308
aVin the United States.
p309
aVSo stay tuned.
p310
aa(lp311
VAll right. So I showed you some of our exciting robots at work.
p312
aVSo, what is the secret of our success?
p313
aVWhere do we come up with these ideas?
p314
aVHow do we develop these kinds of ideas?
p315
aVWe have a fully autonomous vehicle
p316
aVthat can drive into urban environments.
p317
aVWe won a half a million dollars in the DARPA Urban Challenge.
p318
aVWe also have the world's very first vehicle that can be driven by the blind.
p319
aVWe call it the Blind Driver Challenge, very exciting.
p320
aVAnd many, many other robotics projects I want to talk about.
p321
aVThese are just the awards that we won in 2007 fall
p322
aVfrom robotics competitions and those kinds of things.
p323
aa(lp324
VSo really, we have five secrets.
p325
aVFirst is: Where do we get inspiration?
p326
aVWhere do we get this spark of imagination?
p327
aVThis is a true story, my personal story.
p328
aVAt night, when I go to bed, at three, four in the morning,
p329
aVI lie down, close my eyes, and I see these lines and circles
p330
aVand different shapes floating around.
p331
aVAnd they assemble, and they form these kinds of mechanisms.
p332
aVAnd I think, "Ah, this is cool."
p333
aVSo right next to my bed I keep a notebook, a journal,
p334
aVwith a special pen that has an LED light on it,
p335
aVbecause I don't want to turn on the light and wake up my wife.
p336
aa(lp337
VSo I see this, scribble everything down, draw things, and go to bed.
p338
aVEvery day in the morning, the first thing I do,
p339
aVbefore my first cup of coffee, before I brush my teeth,
p340
aVI open my notebook.
p341
aVMany times it's empty; sometimes I have something there.
p342
aVIf something's there, sometimes it's junk.
p343
aVBut most of the time, I can't read my handwriting.
p344
aVFour in the morning \u2014 what do you expect, right?
p345
aVSo I need to decipher what I wrote.
p346
aVBut sometimes I see this ingenious idea in there,
p347
aVand I have this eureka moment.
p348
aVI directly run to my home office, sit at my computer,
p349
aVI type in the ideas, I sketch things out
p350
aVand I keep a database of ideas.
p351
aVSo when we have these calls for proposals,
p352
aVI try to find a match between my potential ideas
p353
aVand the problem.
p354
aVIf there's a match, we write a research proposal,
p355
aVget the research funding in,
p356
aVand that's how we start our research programs.
p357
aa(lp358
VBut just a spark of imagination is not good enough.
p359
aVHow do we develop these kinds of ideas?
p360
aVAt our lab RoMeLa, the Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory,
p361
aVwe have these fantastic brainstorming sessions.
p362
aVSo we gather around, we discuss problems and solutions and talk about it.
p363
aVBut before we start, we set this golden rule.
p364
aVThe rule is:
p365
aVnobody criticizes anybody's ideas.
p366
aVNobody criticizes any opinion.
p367
aVThis is important, because many times, students fear or feel uncomfortable
p368
aVabout how others might think about their opinions and thoughts.
p369
aa(lp370
VSo once you do this, it is amazing how the students open up.
p371
aVThey have these wacky, cool, crazy, brilliant ideas,
p372
aVand the whole room is just electrified with creative energy.
p373
aVAnd this is how we develop our ideas.
p374
aa(lp375
VWell, we're running out of time.
p376
aVOne more thing I want to talk about is,
p377
aVyou know, just a spark of idea and development is not good enough.
p378
aVThere was a great TED moment \u2014 I think it was Sir Ken Robinson, was it?
p379
aVHe gave a talk about how education and school kill creativity.
p380
aVWell, actually, there's two sides to the story.
p381
aVSo there is only so much one can do with just ingenious ideas
p382
aVand creativity and good engineering intuition.
p383
aVIf you want to go beyond a tinkering,
p384
aVif you want to go beyond a hobby of robotics
p385
aVand really tackle the grand challenges of robotics
p386
aVthrough rigorous research,
p387
aVwe need more than that.
p388
aVThis is where school comes in.
p389
aa(lp390
VBatman, fighting against the bad guys,
p391
aVhe has his utility belt, he has his grappling hook,
p392
aVhe has all different kinds of gadgets.
p393
aVFor us roboticists, engineers and scientists,
p394
aVthese tools are the courses and classes you take in class.
p395
aVMath, differential equations.
p396
aVI have linear algebra, science, physics \u2014
p397
aVeven, nowadays, chemistry and biology, as you've seen.
p398
aVThese are all the tools we need.
p399
aVSo the more tools you have, for Batman,
p400
aVmore effective at fighting the bad guys,
p401
aVfor us, more tools to attack these kinds of big problems.
p402
aVSo education is very important.
p403
aa(lp404
VAlso \u2014 it's not only about that.
p405
aVYou also have to work really, really hard.
p406
aVSo I always tell my students,
p407
aV"Work smart, then work hard."
p408
aVThis picture in the back \u2014 this is three in the morning.
p409
aVI guarantee if you come to our lab at 3, 4am,
p410
aVwe have students working there,
p411
aVnot because I tell them to, but because we are having too much fun.
p412
aVWhich leads to the last topic:
p413
aVdo not forget to have fun.
p414
aVThat's really the secret of our success, we're having too much fun.
p415
aVI truly believe that highest productivity comes when you're having fun,
p416
aVand that's what we're doing.
p417
aVAnd there you go.
p418
aa(lp419
VThank you so much.
p420

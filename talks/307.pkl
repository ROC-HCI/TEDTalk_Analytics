VI and my colleagues Art Aron and Lucy Brown and others,
p5
aVhave put 37 people who are madly in love into a functional MRI brain scanner.
p6
aV17 who were happily in love, 15 who had just been dumped,
p7
aVand we're just starting our third experiment:
p8
aVstudying people who report that they're still in love
p9
aVafter 10 to 25 years of marriage.
p10
aVSo, this is the short story of that research.
p11
aa(lp12
VIn the jungles of Guatemala, in Tikal, stands a temple.
p13
aVIt was built by the grandest Sun King, of the grandest city-state,
p14
aVof the grandest civilization of the Americas, the Mayas.
p15
aVHis name was Jasaw Chan K'awiil.
p16
aVHe stood over six feet tall.
p17
aVHe lived into his 80s,
p18
aVand he was buried beneath this monument in 720 AD.
p19
aVAnd Mayan inscriptions proclaim that he was deeply in love with his wife.
p20
aVSo, he built a temple in her honor, facing his.
p21
aVAnd every spring and autumn, exactly at the equinox,
p22
aVthe sun rises behind his temple,
p23
aVand perfectly bathes her temple with his shadow.
p24
aVAnd as the sun sets behind her temple in the afternoon,
p25
aVit perfectly bathes his temple with her shadow.
p26
aVAfter 1,300 years, these two lovers still touch and kiss from their tomb.
p27
aa(lp28
VAround the world, people love.
p29
aVThey sing for love, they dance for love,
p30
aVthey compose poems and stories about love.
p31
aVThey tell myths and legends about love.
p32
aVThey pine for love, they live for love, they kill for love, and they die for love.
p33
aVAs Walt Whitman once said, "O I would stake all for you."
p34
aVAnthropologists have found evidence of romantic love in 170 societies.
p35
aVThey've never found a society that did not have it.
p36
aa(lp37
VBut love isn't always a happy experience.
p38
aVIn one study of college students, they asked a lot of questions about love,
p39
aVbut the two that stood out to me the most were:
p40
aV"Have you ever been rejected by somebody who you really loved?"
p41
aVAnd the second question was:
p42
aV"Have you ever dumped somebody who really loved you?"
p43
aVAnd almost 95 percent of both men and women said yes to both.
p44
aVAlmost nobody gets out of love alive.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo, before I start telling you about the brain,
p47
aVI want to read for you
p48
aVwhat I think is the most powerful love poem on Earth.
p49
aVThere's other love poems that are, of course, just as good,
p50
aVbut I don't think this one can be surpassed.
p51
aVIt was told by an anonymous Kwakiutl Indian of southern Alaska
p52
aVto a missionary in 1896.
p53
aVAnd here it is.
p54
aVI've never had the opportunity to say it before.
p55
aV"Fire runs through my body with the pain of loving you.
p56
aVPain runs through my body with the fires of my love for you.
p57
aVPain like a boil about to burst with my love for you,
p58
aVconsumed by fire with my love for you.
p59
aVI remember what you said to me.
p60
aVI am thinking of your love for me.
p61
aVI am torn by your love for me.
p62
aVPain and more pain \u2014
p63
aVwhere are you going with my love?
p64
aVI am told you will go from here.
p65
aVI am told you will leave me here.
p66
aVMy body is numb with grief.
p67
aVRemember what I said, my love.
p68
aVGoodbye, my love, goodbye."
p69
aVEmily Dickinson once wrote, "Parting is all we need to know of hell."
p70
aVHow many people have suffered
p71
aVin all the millions of years of human evolution?
p72
aVHow many people around the world
p73
aVare dancing with elation at this very minute?
p74
aVRomantic love is one of the most powerful sensations on Earth.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo, several years ago, I decided to look into the brain
p77
aVand study this madness.
p78
aVOur first study of people who were happily in love
p79
aVhas been widely publicized,
p80
aVso I'm only going to say very little about it.
p81
aVWe found activity in a tiny, little factory near the base of the brain
p82
aVcalled the ventral tegmental area.
p83
aVWe found activity in some cells called the A10 cells,
p84
aVcells that actually make dopamine, a natural stimulant,
p85
aVand spray it to many brain regions.
p86
aVIndeed, this part, the VTA, is part of the brain's reward system.
p87
aVIt's way below your cognitive thinking process.
p88
aVIt's below your emotions.
p89
aVIt's part of what we call the reptilian core of the brain,
p90
aVassociated with wanting, with motivation, with focus and with craving.
p91
aVIn fact, the same brain region where we found activity
p92
aVbecomes active also when you feel the rush of cocaine.
p93
aa(lp94
VBut romantic love is much more than a cocaine high \u2014
p95
aVat least you come down from cocaine.
p96
aVRomantic love is an obsession, it possesses you.
p97
aVYou lose your sense of self.
p98
aVYou can't stop thinking about another human being.
p99
aVSomebody is camping in your head.
p100
aVAs an eighth-century Japanese poet said, "My longing had no time when it ceases."
p101
aVWild is love.
p102
aVAnd the obsession can get worse when you've been rejected.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo, right now, Lucy Brown and I, the neuroscientists on our project,
p105
aVare looking at the data of the people
p106
aVwho were put into the machine after they had just been dumped.
p107
aVIt was very difficult actually, putting these people in the machine,
p108
aVbecause they were in such bad shape.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VSo anyway, we found activity in three brain regions.
p113
aVWe found activity in the brain region,
p114
aVin exactly the same brain region associated with intense romantic love.
p115
aVWhat a bad deal.
p116
aVYou know, when you've been dumped,
p117
aVthe one thing you love to do is just forget about this human being,
p118
aVand then go on with your life \u2014 but no, you just love them harder.
p119
aVAs the poet Terence, the Roman poet once said,
p120
aVhe said, "The less my hope, the hotter my love."
p121
aVAnd indeed, we now know why.
p122
aVTwo thousand years later, we can explain this in the brain.
p123
aVThat brain system \u2014 the reward system
p124
aVfor wanting, for motivation, for craving, for focus \u2014
p125
aVbecomes more active when you can't get what you want.
p126
aVIn this case, life's greatest prize: an appropriate mating partner.
p127
aa(lp128
VWe found activity in other brain regions also \u2014
p129
aVin a brain region associated with calculating gains and losses.
p130
aVYou're lying there, you're looking at the picture,
p131
aVand you're in this machine,
p132
aVand you're calculating what went wrong.
p133
aVWhat have I lost?
p134
aVAs a matter of fact, Lucy and I have a little joke about this.
p135
aVIt comes from a David Mamet play,
p136
aVand there's two con artists in the play,
p137
aVand the woman is conning the man,
p138
aVand the man looks at the woman and says,
p139
aV"Oh, you're a bad pony, I'm not going to bet on you."
p140
aVAnd indeed, it's this part of the brain,
p141
aVthe core of the nucleus accumbens,
p142
aVthat is becoming active as you're measuring your gains and losses.
p143
aVIt's also the brain region that becomes active
p144
aVwhen you're willing to take enormous risks for huge gains and huge losses.
p145
aa(lp146
VLast but not least, we found activity in a brain region
p147
aVassociated with deep attachment to another individual.
p148
aVNo wonder people suffer around the world, and we have so many crimes of passion.
p149
aVWhen you've been rejected in love,
p150
aVnot only are you engulfed with feelings of romantic love,
p151
aVbut you're feeling deep attachment to this individual.
p152
aVMoreover, this brain circuit for reward is working,
p153
aVand you're feeling intense energy, intense focus, intense motivation
p154
aVand the willingness to risk it all, to win life's greatest prize.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo, what have I learned from this experiment
p157
aVthat I would like to tell the world?
p158
aVForemost, I have come to think
p159
aVthat romantic love is a drive, a basic mating drive.
p160
aVNot the sex drive \u2014
p161
aVthe sex drive gets you looking for a whole range of partners.
p162
aVRomantic love enables you to focus your mating energy
p163
aVon just one at a time, conserve your mating energy,
p164
aVand start the mating process with this single individual.
p165
aVI think of all the poetry that I've read about romantic love,
p166
aVwhat sums it up best is something that is said by Plato
p167
aVover 2,000 years ago.
p168
aVHe said, "The god of love lives in a state of need.
p169
aVIt is a need, it is an urge, it is a homeostatic imbalance.
p170
aVLike hunger and thirst, it's almost impossible to stamp out."
p171
aVI've also come to believe that romantic love is an addiction:
p172
aVa perfectly wonderful addiction when it's going well,
p173
aVand a perfectly horrible addiction when it's going poorly.
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd indeed, it has all of the characteristics of addiction.
p176
aVYou focus on the person, you obsessively think about them,
p177
aVyou crave them, you distort reality,
p178
aVyour willingness to take enormous risks to win this person.
p179
aVAnd it's got the three main characteristics of addiction:
p180
aVtolerance, you need to see them more, and more, and more;
p181
aVwithdrawals;
p182
aVand last: relapse.
p183
aVI've got a girlfriend who's just getting over a terrible love affair.
p184
aVIt's been about eight months, she's beginning to feel better.
p185
aVAnd she was driving along in her car the other day,
p186
aVand suddenly she heard a song on the car radio
p187
aVthat reminded her of this man.
p188
aVNot only did the instant craving come back,
p189
aVbut she had to pull over from the side of the road and cry.
p190
aVSo, one thing I would like the medical community,
p191
aVand the legal community, and even the college community,
p192
aVto see if they can understand, that indeed, romantic love
p193
aVis one of the most addictive substances on Earth.
p194
aa(lp195
VI would also like to tell the world that animals love.
p196
aVThere's not an animal on this planet
p197
aVthat will copulate with anything that comes along.
p198
aVToo old, too young, too scruffy, too stupid, and they won't do it.
p199
aVUnless you're stuck in a laboratory cage \u2014
p200
aVand you know, if you spend your entire life in a little box,
p201
aVyou're not going to be as picky about who you have sex with,
p202
aVbut I've looked in a hundred species,
p203
aVand everywhere in the wild, animals have favorites.
p204
aVAs a matter of fact, ethologists know this.
p205
aVThere are over eight words for what they call "animal favoritism:"
p206
aVselective proceptivity, mate choice, female choice, sexual choice.
p207
aVAnd indeed, there are now three academic articles
p208
aVin which they've looked at this attraction,
p209
aVwhich may only last for a second,
p210
aVbut it's a definite attraction,
p211
aVand either this same brain region, this reward system,
p212
aVor the chemicals of that reward system are involved.
p213
aVIn fact, I think animal attraction can be instant \u2014
p214
aVyou can see an elephant instantly go for another elephant.
p215
aVAnd I think that this is really the origin
p216
aVof what you and I call "love at first sight."
p217
aa(lp218
VPeople have often asked me
p219
aVwhether what I know about love has spoiled it for me.
p220
aVAnd I just simply say, "Hardly."
p221
aVYou can know every single ingredient in a piece of chocolate cake,
p222
aVand then when you sit down and eat that cake,
p223
aVyou can still feel that joy.
p224
aVAnd certainly, I make all the same mistakes that everybody else does too,
p225
aVbut it's really deepened my understanding
p226
aVand compassion, really, for all human life.
p227
aVAs a matter of fact, in New York, I often catch myself
p228
aVlooking in baby carriages and feeling a little sorry for the tot.
p229
aVAnd in fact, sometimes I feel a little sorry
p230
aVfor the chicken on my dinner plate,
p231
aVwhen I think of how intense this brain system is.
p232
aVOur newest experiment has been hatched
p233
aVby my colleague, Art Aron \u2014
p234
aVputting people who are reporting that they are still in love,
p235
aVin a long-term relationship, into the functional MRI.
p236
aVWe've put five people in so far,
p237
aVand indeed, we found exactly the same thing.
p238
aVThey're not lying.
p239
aVThe brain areas associated with intense romantic love
p240
aVstill become active, 25 years later.
p241
aa(lp242
VThere are still many questions to be answered
p243
aVand asked about romantic love.
p244
aVThe question that I'm working on right this minute \u2014
p245
aVand I'm only going to say it for a second, and then end \u2014
p246
aVis, why do you fall in love with one person, rather than another?
p247
aVI never would have even thought to think of this,
p248
aVbut Match.com, the Internet dating site,
p249
aVcame to me three years ago and asked me that question.
p250
aVAnd I said, I don't know.
p251
aVI know what happens in the brain, when you do become in love,
p252
aVbut I don't know why you fall in love with one person rather than another.
p253
aVAnd so, I've spent the last three years on this.
p254
aVAnd there are many reasons that you fall in love with one person
p255
aVrather than another, that psychologists can tell you.
p256
aVAnd we tend to fall in love with somebody from the same socioeconomic background,
p257
aVthe same general level of intelligence, of good looks, the same religious values.
p258
aVYour childhood certainly plays a role, but nobody knows how.
p259
aVAnd that's about it, that's all they know.
p260
aVNo, they've never found
p261
aVthe way two personalities fit together to make a good relationship.
p262
aa(lp263
VSo, it began to occur to me
p264
aVthat maybe your biology pulls you towards some people rather than another.
p265
aVAnd I have concocted a questionnaire to see to what degree
p266
aVyou express dopamine, serotonin, estrogen and testosterone.
p267
aVI think we've evolved four very broad personality types
p268
aVassociated with the ratios of these four chemicals in the brain.
p269
aVAnd on this dating site that I have created, called Chemistry.com,
p270
aVI ask you first a series of questions
p271
aVto see to what degree you express these chemicals,
p272
aVand I'm watching who chooses who to love.
p273
aVAnd 3.7 million people have taken the questionnaire in America.
p274
aVAbout 600,000 people have taken it in 33 other countries.
p275
aVI'm putting the data together now,
p276
aVand at some point \u2014 there will always be magic to love,
p277
aVbut I think I will come closer to understanding
p278
aVwhy it is you can walk into a room and everybody is from your background,
p279
aVyour same general level of intelligence, good looks,
p280
aVand you don't feel pulled towards all of them.
p281
aVI think there's biology to that.
p282
aVI think we're going to end up, in the next few years,
p283
aVto understand all kinds of brain mechanisms
p284
aVthat pull us to one person rather than another.
p285
aa(lp286
VSo, I will close with this.
p287
aVThese are my older people.
p288
aVFaulkner said, "The past is not dead, it's not even past."
p289
aVIndeed, we carry a lot of luggage from our yesteryear in the human brain.
p290
aVAnd so, there's one thing that makes me pursue my understanding of human nature,
p291
aVand this reminds me of it.
p292
aVThese are two women.
p293
aVWomen tend to get intimacy differently than men do.
p294
aVWomen get intimacy from face-to-face talking.
p295
aVWe swivel towards each other,
p296
aVwe do what we call the "anchoring gaze" and we talk.
p297
aVThis is intimacy to women.
p298
aVI think it comes from millions of years
p299
aVof holding that baby in front of your face,
p300
aVcajoling it, reprimanding it, educating it with words.
p301
aVMen tend to get intimacy from side-by-side doing.
p302
aVAs soon as one guy looks up, the other guy will look away.
p303
aa(lp304
V(Laughter)
p305
aa(lp306
VI think it comes from millions of years sitting behind the bush,
p307
aVlooking straight ahead, trying to hit that buffalo on the head with a rock.
p308
aVI think, for millions of years, men faced their enemies,
p309
aVthey sat side-by-side with friends.
p310
aVSo my final statement is: love is in us.
p311
aVIt's deeply embedded in the brain.
p312
aVOur challenge is to understand each other.
p313
aa(lp314
VThank you.
p315
aa(lp316
V(Applause)

VMy topic
p5
aVis economic growth in China and India.
p6
aVAnd the question I want to explore with you
p7
aVis whether or not
p8
aVdemocracy has helped or has hindered
p9
aVeconomic growth.
p10
aVYou may say this is not fair,
p11
aVbecause I'm selecting two countries
p12
aVto make a case against democracy.
p13
aVActually, exactly the opposite
p14
aVis what I'm going to do.
p15
aVI'm going to use these two countries
p16
aVto make an economic argument for democracy,
p17
aVrather than against democracy.
p18
aa(lp19
VThe first question there
p20
aVis why China has grown so much faster
p21
aVthan India.
p22
aVOver the last 30 years,
p23
aVin terms of the GDP growth rates,
p24
aVChina has grown at twice the rate of India.
p25
aVIn the last five years,
p26
aVthe two countries have begun to converge somewhat
p27
aVin economic growth.
p28
aVBut over the last 30 years,
p29
aVChina undoubtedly
p30
aVhas done much better than India.
p31
aVOne simple answer
p32
aVis China has Shanghai and India has Mumbai.
p33
aVLook at the skyline of Shanghai.
p34
aVThis is the Pudong area.
p35
aVThe picture on India
p36
aVis the Dharavi slum of Mumbai
p37
aVin India.
p38
aVThe idea there
p39
aVbehind these two pictures
p40
aVis that the Chinese government
p41
aVcan act above rule of law.
p42
aVIt can plan
p43
aVfor the long-term benefits of the country
p44
aVand in the process,
p45
aVevict millions of people \u2014
p46
aVthat's just a small technical issue.
p47
aVWhereas in India, you cannot do that,
p48
aVbecause you have to listen to the public.
p49
aVYou're being constrained by the public's opinion.
p50
aVEven Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
p51
aVagrees with that view.
p52
aVIn an interview
p53
aVprinted in the financial press of India,
p54
aVHe said that he wants to make Mumbai
p55
aVanother Shanghai.
p56
aVThis is an Oxford-trained economist
p57
aVsteeped in humanistic values,
p58
aVand yet he agrees
p59
aVwith the high-pressure tactics of Shanghai.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo let me call it the Shanghai model of economic growth,
p62
aVthat emphasizes the following features
p63
aVfor promoting economic development:
p64
aVinfrastructures, airports,
p65
aVhighways, bridges, things like that.
p66
aVAnd you need a strong government to do that,
p67
aVbecause you cannot respect private property rights.
p68
aVYou cannot be constrained by the public's opinion.
p69
aVYou need also state ownership,
p70
aVespecially of land assets,
p71
aVin order to build and roll out infrastructures
p72
aVvery quickly.
p73
aVThe implication of that model
p74
aVis that democracy
p75
aVis a hindrance for economic growth,
p76
aVrather than a facilitator of economic growth.
p77
aVHere's the key question.
p78
aVJust how important are infrastructures
p79
aVfor economic growth?
p80
aVThis is a key issue.
p81
aVIf you believe that infrastructures are very important for economic growth,
p82
aVthen you would argue a strong government is necessary
p83
aVto promote growth.
p84
aVIf you believe
p85
aVthat infrastructures are not as important as many people believe,
p86
aVthen you will put less emphasis
p87
aVon strong government.
p88
aa(lp89
VSo to illustrate that question,
p90
aVlet me give you two countries.
p91
aVAnd for the sake of brevity,
p92
aVI'll call one country Country 1
p93
aVand the other country Country 2.
p94
aVCountry 1
p95
aVhas a systematic advantage over Country 2
p96
aVin infrastructures.
p97
aVCountry 1 has more telephones,
p98
aVand Country 1 has a longer system of railways.
p99
aVSo if I were to ask you,
p100
aV"Which is China
p101
aVand which is India,
p102
aVand which country has grown faster?"
p103
aVif you believe in the infrastructure view,
p104
aVthen you will say, "Country 1 must be China.
p105
aVThey must have done better, in terms of economic growth.
p106
aVAnd Country 2 is possibly India."
p107
aa(lp108
VActually the country with more telephones
p109
aVis the Soviet Union,
p110
aVand the data referred to 1989.
p111
aVAfter the country reported very impressive statistics on telephones,
p112
aVthe country collapsed.
p113
aVThat's not too good.
p114
aVThe picture there is Khrushchev.
p115
aVI know that in 1989
p116
aVhe no longer ruled the Soviet Union,
p117
aVbut that's the best picture that I can find.
p118
aV(Laughter)
p119
aVTelephones, infrastructures
p120
aVdo not guarantee you economic growth.
p121
aVCountry 2, that has fewer telephones,
p122
aVis China.
p123
aVSince 1989,
p124
aVthe country has performed at a double-digit rate
p125
aVevery year for the last 20 years.
p126
aVIf you know nothing about China and the Soviet Union
p127
aVother than the fact about their telephones,
p128
aVyou would have made a poor prediction
p129
aVabout their economic growth
p130
aVin the next two decades.
p131
aa(lp132
VCountry 1, that has a longer system of railways,
p133
aVis actually India.
p134
aVAnd Country 2 is China.
p135
aVThis is a very little known fact
p136
aVabout the two countries.
p137
aVYes, today China has a huge infrastructure advantage
p138
aVover India.
p139
aVBut for many years,
p140
aVuntil the late 1990s,
p141
aVChina had an infrastructure disadvantage
p142
aVvis-a-vis India.
p143
aVIn developing countries,
p144
aVthe most common mode of transportation
p145
aVis the railways,
p146
aVand the British built a lot of railways in India.
p147
aVIndia is the smaller of the two countries,
p148
aVand yet it had a longer system of railways
p149
aVuntil the late 1990s.
p150
aVSo clearly,
p151
aVinfrastructure doesn't explain
p152
aVwhy China did better before the late 1990s,
p153
aVas compared with India.
p154
aa(lp155
VIn fact, if you look at the evidence worldwide,
p156
aVthe evidence is more supportive of the view
p157
aVthat the infrastructure are actually the result of economic growth.
p158
aVThe economy grows,
p159
aVgovernment accumulates more resources,
p160
aVand the government can invest in infrastructure \u2014
p161
aVrather than infrastructure being a cause
p162
aVfor economic growth.
p163
aVAnd this is clearly the story
p164
aVof the Chinese economic growth.
p165
aVLet me look at this question more directly.
p166
aVIs democracy bad for economic growth?
p167
aVNow let's turn to two countries,
p168
aVCountry A and Country B.
p169
aVCountry A, in 1990,
p170
aVhad about $300 per capita GDP
p171
aVas compared with Country B,
p172
aVwhich had $460 in per capita GDP.
p173
aVBy 2008,
p174
aVCountry A has surpassed Country B
p175
aVwith $700 per capita GDP
p176
aVas compared with $650 per capita GDP.
p177
aVBoth countries are in Asia.
p178
aa(lp179
VIf I were to ask you,
p180
aV"Which are the two Asian countries?
p181
aVAnd which one is a democracy?"
p182
aVyou may argue,
p183
aV"Well, maybe Country A is China
p184
aVand Country B is India."
p185
aVIn fact, Country A
p186
aVis democratic India,
p187
aVand Country B is Pakistan \u2014
p188
aVthe country that has a long period
p189
aVof military rule.
p190
aVAnd it's very common
p191
aVthat we compare India with China.
p192
aVThat's because the two countries
p193
aVhave about the same population size.
p194
aVBut the more natural comparison
p195
aVis actually between India and Pakistan.
p196
aVThose two countries are geographically similar.
p197
aVThey have a complicated, but shared common history.
p198
aVBy that comparison,
p199
aVdemocracy looks very, very good
p200
aVin terms of economic growth.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo why do economists fall in love
p203
aVwith authoritarian governments?
p204
aVOne reason is the East Asian Model.
p205
aVIn East Asia,
p206
aVwe have had successful economic growth stories
p207
aVsuch as Korea, Taiwan,
p208
aVHong Kong and Singapore.
p209
aVSome of these economies
p210
aVwere ruled by authoritarian governments
p211
aVin the 60s and 70s
p212
aVand 1980s.
p213
aVThe problem with that view
p214
aVis like asking all the winners of lotteries,
p215
aV"Have you won the lottery?"
p216
aVAnd they all tell you, "Yes, we have won the lottery."
p217
aVAnd then you draw the conclusion
p218
aVthe odds of winning the lottery
p219
aVare 100 percent.
p220
aVThe reason is you never go
p221
aVand bother to ask the losers
p222
aVwho also purchased lottery tickets
p223
aVand didn't end up winning the prize.
p224
aa(lp225
VFor each of these successful authoritarian governments
p226
aVin East Asia,
p227
aVthere's a matched failure.
p228
aVKorea succeeded, North Korea didn't.
p229
aVTaiwan succeeded, China under Mao Zedong didn't.
p230
aVBurma didn't succeed.
p231
aVThe Philippines didn't succeed.
p232
aVIf you look at the statistical evidence worldwide,
p233
aVthere's really no support for the idea
p234
aVthat authoritarian governments
p235
aVhold a systematic edge over democracies
p236
aVin terms of economic growth.
p237
aVSo the East Asian model
p238
aVhas this massive selection bias \u2014
p239
aVit is known as selecting on a dependent variable,
p240
aVsomething we always tell our students to avoid.
p241
aa(lp242
VSo exactly why did China grow so much faster?
p243
aVI will take you to the Cultural Revolution,
p244
aVwhen China went mad,
p245
aVand compare that country's performance with India
p246
aVunder Indira Gandhi.
p247
aVThe question there is: Which country did better,
p248
aVChina or India?
p249
aVChina was during the Cultural Revolution.
p250
aVIt turns out even during the Cultural Revolution,
p251
aVChina out-perfomed India
p252
aVin terms of GDP growth
p253
aVby an average of about 2.2 percent every year
p254
aVin terms of per capita GDP.
p255
aVSo that's when China was mad.
p256
aVThe whole country went mad.
p257
aVIt must mean that the country
p258
aVhad something so advantageous to itself in terms of economic growth
p259
aVto overcome the negative effects
p260
aVof the Cultural Revolution.
p261
aVThe advantage the country had
p262
aVwas human capital \u2014
p263
aVnothing else but human capital.
p264
aa(lp265
VThis is the world development index indicator data
p266
aVin the early 1990s.
p267
aVAnd this is the earliest data that I can find.
p268
aVThe adult literacy rate in China
p269
aVis 77 percent
p270
aVas compared with 48 percent in India.
p271
aVThe contrast in literacy rates
p272
aVis especially sharp
p273
aVbetween Chinese women and Indian women.
p274
aVI haven't told you about the definition of literacy.
p275
aVIn China, the definition of literacy
p276
aVis the ability to read and write
p277
aV1,500 Chinese characters.
p278
aVIn India, the definition of literacy,
p279
aVoperating definition of literacy,
p280
aVis the ability, the grand ability,
p281
aVto write your own name
p282
aVin whatever language you happen to speak.
p283
aVThe gap between the two countries in terms of literacy
p284
aVis much more substantial
p285
aVthan the data here indicated.
p286
aVIf you go to other sources of data
p287
aVsuch as Human Development Index,
p288
aVthat data series,
p289
aVgo back to the early 1970s,
p290
aVyou see exactly the same contrast.
p291
aVChina held a huge advantage
p292
aVin terms of human capital
p293
aVvis-a-vis India.
p294
aa(lp295
VLife expectancies:
p296
aVas early as 1965,
p297
aVChina had a huge advantage in life expectancy.
p298
aVOn average, as a Chinese in 1965,
p299
aVyou lived 10 years more
p300
aVthan an average Indian.
p301
aVSo if you have a choice
p302
aVbetween being a Chinese and being an Indian,
p303
aVyou would want to become a Chinese
p304
aVin order to live 10 years longer.
p305
aVIf you made that decision in 1965,
p306
aVthe down side of that
p307
aVis the next year we have the Cultural Revolution.
p308
aVSo you have to always think carefully
p309
aVabout these decisions.
p310
aa(lp311
VIf you cannot chose your nationality,
p312
aVthen you will want to become an Indian man.
p313
aVBecause, as an Indian man,
p314
aVyou have about two years of life expectancy advantage
p315
aVvis-a-vis Indian women.
p316
aVThis is an extremely strange fact.
p317
aVIt's very rare among countries
p318
aVto have this kind of pattern.
p319
aVIt shows the systematic discrimination and biases
p320
aVin the Indian society
p321
aVagainst women.
p322
aVThe good news is, by 2006,
p323
aVIndia has closed the gap
p324
aVbetween men and women
p325
aVin terms of life expectancy.
p326
aVToday, Indian women have a sizable life expectancy edge
p327
aVover Indian men.
p328
aVSo India is reverting to the normal.
p329
aVBut India still has a lot of work to do
p330
aVin terms of gender equality.
p331
aa(lp332
VThese are the two pictures
p333
aVtaken of garment factories in Guangdong Province
p334
aVand garment factories in India.
p335
aVIn China, it's all women.
p336
aV60 to 80 percent of the workforce in China is women
p337
aVin the coastal part of the country,
p338
aVwhereas in India, it's all men.
p339
aVFinancial Times printed this picture
p340
aVof an Indian textile factory
p341
aVwith the title, "India Poised to Overtake China in Textile."
p342
aVBy looking at these two pictures,
p343
aVI say no, it won't overtake China for a while.
p344
aVIf you look at other East Asian countries,
p345
aVwomen there play a hugely important role
p346
aVin terms of economic take-off \u2014
p347
aVin terms of creating the manufacturing miracle
p348
aVassociated with East Asia.
p349
aVIndia still has a long way to go
p350
aVto catch up with China.
p351
aa(lp352
VThen the issue is,
p353
aVwhat about the Chinese political system?
p354
aVYou talk about human capital,
p355
aVyou talk about education and public health.
p356
aVWhat about the political system?
p357
aVIsn't it true that the one-party political system
p358
aVhas facilitated economic growth in China?
p359
aVActually, the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that.
p360
aVIt depends on a distinction that you draw
p361
aVbetween statics of the political system
p362
aVand the dynamics of the political system.
p363
aVStatically, China is a one-party system,
p364
aVauthoritarian \u2014 there's no question about it.
p365
aVDynamically, it has changed over time
p366
aVto become less authoritarian and more democratic.
p367
aVWhen you explain change \u2014
p368
aVfor example, economic growth;
p369
aVeconomic growth is about change \u2014
p370
aVwhen you explain change,
p371
aVyou use other things that have changed to explain change,
p372
aVrather than using the constant to explain change.
p373
aVSometimes a fixed effect can explain change,
p374
aVbut a fixed effect only explains changes
p375
aVin interaction with the things that change.
p376
aa(lp377
VIn terms of the political changes,
p378
aVthey have introduced village elections.
p379
aVThey have increased the security of proprietors.
p380
aVAnd they have increased the security
p381
aVwith long-term land leases.
p382
aVThere are also financial reforms in rural China.
p383
aVThere is also a rural entrepreneurial revolution in China.
p384
aVTo me, the pace of political changes
p385
aVis too slow, too gradual.
p386
aVAnd my own view is the country
p387
aVis going to face some substantial challenges,
p388
aVbecause they have not moved further and faster on political reforms.
p389
aVBut nevertheless,
p390
aVthe system has moved in a more liberal direction,
p391
aVmoved in a more democratic direction.
p392
aa(lp393
VYou can apply exactly the same dynamic perspective on India.
p394
aVIn fact, when India was growing
p395
aVat a Hindu rate of growth \u2014
p396
aVabout one percent, two percent a year \u2014
p397
aVthat was when India was least democratic.
p398
aVIndira Gandhi declared emergency rule in 1975.
p399
aVThe Indian government owned and operated
p400
aVall the TV stations.
p401
aVA little-known fact about India in the 1990s
p402
aVis that the country
p403
aVnot only has undertaken economic reforms,
p404
aVthe country has also undertaken political reforms
p405
aVby introducing village self-rule,
p406
aVprivatization of media
p407
aVand introducing freedom of information acts.
p408
aVSo the dynamic perspective
p409
aVfits both with China and in India
p410
aVin terms of the direction.
p411
aa(lp412
VWhy do many people believe
p413
aVthat India is still a growth disaster?
p414
aVOne reason
p415
aVis they are always comparing India with China.
p416
aVBut China is a superstar
p417
aVin terms of economic growth.
p418
aVIf you are a NBA player
p419
aVand you are always being compared to Michael Jordan,
p420
aVyou're going to look not so impressive.
p421
aVBut that doesn't mean
p422
aVthat you're a bad basketball player.
p423
aVComparing with a superstar
p424
aVis the wrong benchmark.
p425
aVIn fact, if you compare India
p426
aVwith the average developing country,
p427
aVeven before the more recent period
p428
aVof acceleration of Indian growth \u2014
p429
aVnow India is growing between eight and nine percent \u2014
p430
aVeven before this period,
p431
aVIndia was ranked fourth in terms of economic growth
p432
aVamong emerging economies.
p433
aVThis is a very impressive record indeed.
p434
aa(lp435
VLet's think about the future:
p436
aVthe dragon vis-a-vis the elephant.
p437
aVWhich country has the growth momentum?
p438
aVChina, I believe, still has
p439
aVsome of the excellent raw fundamentals \u2014
p440
aVmostly the social capital,
p441
aVthe public health,
p442
aVthe sense of egalitarianism
p443
aVthat you don't find in India.
p444
aVBut I believe that India has the momentum.
p445
aVIt has the improving fundamentals.
p446
aVThe government has invested in basic education,
p447
aVhas invested in basic health.
p448
aVI believe the government should do more,
p449
aVbut nevertheless, the direction it is moving in
p450
aVis the right direction.
p451
aVIndia has the right institutional conditions
p452
aVfor economic growth,
p453
aVwhereas China is still struggling
p454
aVwith political reforms.
p455
aa(lp456
VI believe that the political reforms are a must for China
p457
aVto maintain its growth.
p458
aVAnd it's very important to have political reforms,
p459
aVto have widely shared benefits of economic growth.
p460
aVI don't know whether that's going to happen or not,
p461
aVbut I'm an optimist.
p462
aVHopefully, five years from now, I'm going to report to TEDGlobal
p463
aVthat political reforms will happen in China.
p464
aa(lp465
VThank you very much.

He is a vocal critic of US foreign policy in China, calling on American leaders to rethink their messages, which often do not resonate with the Chinese public, and to use technology to broaden their reach, overcome stereotypes and quash conspiracy theories.

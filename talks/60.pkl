(lp4
VSo my grandfather told me when I was a little girl,
p5
aV"If you say a word often enough, it becomes you."
p6
aVAnd having grown up in a segregated city, Baltimore, Maryland,
p7
aVI sort of use that idea to go around America with a tape recorder \u2014
p8
aVthank God for technology \u2014
p9
aVto interview people, thinking that if I walked in their words \u2014
p10
aVwhich is also why I don't wear shoes when I perform \u2014
p11
aVif I walked in their words, that I could sort of absorb America.
p12
aVI was also inspired by Walt Whitman,
p13
aVwho wanted to absorb America and have it absorb him.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo these four characters are going to be from that work
p16
aVthat I've been doing for many years now,
p17
aVand well over, I don't know, a couple of thousand people
p18
aVI've interviewed.
p19
aVAnybody out here old enough to know Studs Terkel, that old radio man?
p20
aVSo I thought he would be the perfect person
p21
aVto go to to ask about a defining moment in American history.
p22
aVYou know, he was "born in 1912, the year the Titanic sank,
p23
aVgreatest ship every built. Hits the tip of an iceberg,
p24
aVand bam, it went down. It went down and I came up. Wow, some century."
p25
aV(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VSo this is his answer about a defining moment in American history.
p28
aV"Defining moment in American history, I don't think there's one;
p29
aVyou can't say Hiroshima, that's a big one \u2014
p30
aVI can't think of any one moment I would say is a defining moment.
p31
aVThe gradual slippage \u2014 'slippage' is the word
p32
aVused by the people in Watergate, moral slippage \u2014
p33
aVit's a gradual kind of thing, combination of things.
p34
aVYou see, we also have the technology.
p35
aVI say, less and less the human touch.
p36
aa(lp37
V"Oh, let me kind of tell you a funny little play bit.
p38
aVThe Atlanta airport is a modern airport,
p39
aVand they should leave the gate there.
p40
aVThese trains that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination.
p41
aVAnd these trains are smooth,
p42
aVand they're quiet and they're efficient.
p43
aVAnd there's a voice on the train, you know the voice was a human voice.
p44
aVYou see in the old days we had robots, robots imitated humans.
p45
aVNow we have humans imitating robots.
p46
aVSo we got this voice on this train: Concourse One: Omaha, Lincoln.
p47
aVConcourse Two: Dallas, Fort Worth. Same voice.
p48
aVJust as a train is about to go, a young couple rush in
p49
aVand they're just about to close the pneumatic doors.
p50
aVAnd that voice, without losing a beat, says,
p51
aV'Because of late entry, we're delayed 30 seconds.'
p52
aVJust then, everybody's looking at this couple with hateful eyes
p53
aVand the couple's going like this, you know, shrinking.
p54
aVWell, I'd happened to have had a couple of drinks before boarding \u2014
p55
aVI do that to steel my nerves \u2014 and so
p56
aVI imitate a train call, holding my hand on my \u2014
p57
aV'George Orwell, your time has come,' you see.
p58
aVWell, some of you are laughing. Everybody laughs
p59
aVwhen I say that, but not on this train. Silence.
p60
aVAnd so suddenly they're looking at me.
p61
aVSo here I am with the couple, the three of us
p62
aVshrinking at the foot of Calvary about to be up, you know.
p63
aa(lp64
V"Just then I see a baby, a little baby in the lap of a mother.
p65
aVI know it's Hispanic because she's speaking Spanish to her companion.
p66
aVSo I'm going to talk to the baby. So I say to the baby,
p67
aVholding my hand over my mouth because my breath must be 100 proof,
p68
aVI say to the baby, 'Sir or Madam,
p69
aVwhat is your considered opinion of the human species?'
p70
aVAnd the baby looks, you know, the way babies look at you clearly,
p71
aVstarts laughing,
p72
aVstarts busting out with this crazy little laugh.
p73
aVI say, 'Thank God for a human reaction, we haven't lost yet.'
p74
aa(lp75
V"But you see, the human touch, you see, it's disappearing.
p76
aVYou know, you see, you've got to question the official truth.
p77
aVYou know the thing that was so great about Mark Twain \u2014
p78
aVyou know we honor Mark Twain, but we don't read him.
p79
aVWe read 'Huck Finn,' of course, we read 'Huck Finn' of course.
p80
aVI mean, Huck, of course, was tremendous.
p81
aVRemember that great scene on the raft, remember what Huck did?
p82
aVYou see, here's Huck; he's an illiterate kid; he's had no schooling,
p83
aVbut there's something in him.
p84
aVAnd the official truth, the truth was, the law was,
p85
aVthat a black man was a property, was a thing, you see.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd Huck gets on the raft with a property named Jim, a slave, see.
p88
aVAnd he hears that Jim is going to go and take his wife and kids
p89
aVand steal them from the woman who owns them,
p90
aVand Huck says, 'Ooh, oh my God, ooh, ooh \u2014
p91
aVthat woman, that woman never did anybody any harm.
p92
aVOoh, he's going to steal; he's going to steal;
p93
aVhe's going to do a terrible thing.'
p94
aVJust then, two slavers caught up, guys chasing slaves, looking for Jim.
p95
aV'Anybody up on that raft with you?' Huck says, 'Yeah.'
p96
aV'Is he black or white?' 'White.' And they go off.
p97
aVAnd Huck said, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I lied, I lied, ooh,
p98
aVI did a terrible thing, did a terrible thing \u2014 why do I feel so good?'
p99
aa(lp100
V"But it's the goodness of Huck, that stuff that Huck's been made of,
p101
aVyou see, all been buried; it's all been buried.
p102
aVSo the human touch, you see, it's disappearing.
p103
aVSo you ask about a defining moment \u2014
p104
aVain't no defining moment in American history for me.
p105
aVIt's an accretion of moments that add up to where we are now,
p106
aVwhere trivia becomes news.
p107
aVAnd more and more, less and less awareness of the pain of the other.
p108
aVHuh. You know, I don't know if you could use this or not,
p109
aVbut I was quoting Wright Morris, a writer from Nebraska, who says,
p110
aV'We're more and more into communications
p111
aVand less and less into communication.'
p112
aVOkay, kids, I got to scram, got to go see my cardiologist."
p113
aVAnd that's Studs Terkel.
p114
aV(Applause)
p115
aa(lp116
VSo, talk about risk taking. I'm going to do somebody that nobody likes.
p117
aVYou know, most actors want to do characters that are likeable \u2014
p118
aVwell, not always, but the notion, especially at a conference like this,
p119
aVI like to inspire people.
p120
aVBut since this was called "risk taking,"
p121
aVI'm doing somebody who I never do, because she's so unlikeable
p122
aVthat one person actually came backstage
p123
aVand told me to take her out of the show she was in.
p124
aVAnd I'm doing her because I think we think of risk,
p125
aVat a conference like this, as a good thing.
p126
aa(lp127
VBut there are certain other connotations to the word "risk,"
p128
aVand the same thing about the word "nature." What is nature?
p129
aVMaxine Greene, who's a wonderful philosopher
p130
aVwho's as old as Studs, and was the head of a philosophy \u2014
p131
aVgreat, big philosophy kind of an organization \u2014
p132
aVI went to her and asked her what are the two things
p133
aVthat she doesn't know, that she still wants to know.
p134
aVAnd she said, "Well, personally, I still feel like I have to curtsey
p135
aVwhen I see the president of my university.
p136
aVAnd I still feel as though I've got to get coffee
p137
aVfor my male colleagues, even though I've outlived most of them."
p138
aVAnd she said, "And then intellectually,
p139
aVI don't know enough about the negative imagination.
p140
aVAnd September 11th certainly taught us
p141
aVthat that's a whole area we don't investigate."
p142
aa(lp143
VSo this piece is about a negative imagination.
p144
aVIt raises questions about what nature is, what Mother Nature is,
p145
aVand about what a risk can be.
p146
aVAnd I got this in the Maryland Correctional Institute for Women.
p147
aVEverything I do is word for word off a tape.
p148
aVAnd I title things because I think people speak in organic poems,
p149
aVand this is called "A Mirror to Her Mouth."
p150
aVAnd this is an inmate named Paulette Jenkins.
p151
aa(lp152
V"I began to learn how to cover it up,
p153
aVbecause I didn't want nobody to know that this was happening in my home.
p154
aVI want everybody to think we were a normal family.
p155
aVI mean we had all the materialistic things,
p156
aVbut that didn't make my children pain any less;
p157
aVthat didn't make their fears subside.
p158
aVI ran out of excuses about how we got black eyes
p159
aVand busted lips and bruises. I didn't had no more excuses.
p160
aVAnd he beat me too. But that didn't change the fact
p161
aVthat it was a nightmare for my family; it was a nightmare.
p162
aVAnd I failed them dramatically,
p163
aVbecause I allowed it to go on and on and on.
p164
aa(lp165
V"But the night that Myesha got killed \u2014
p166
aVand the intensity just grew and grew and grew,
p167
aVuntil one night we came home from getting drugs,
p168
aVand he got angry with Myesha, and he started beating her,
p169
aVand he put her in a bathtub. Oh, he would use a belt.
p170
aVHe had a belt because he had this warped perverted thing
p171
aVthat Myesha was having sex with her little brother
p172
aVand they was fondling each other \u2014 that would be his reason.
p173
aVI'm just talking about the particular night that she died.
p174
aVAnd so he put her in the bathtub,
p175
aVand I was in the bedroom with the baby.
p176
aa(lp177
V"And four months before this happened, four months before Myesha died,
p178
aVI thought I could really fix this man. So I had a baby by him \u2014 insane \u2014
p179
aVthinking that if I gave him his own kid, he would leave mine alone.
p180
aVAnd it didn't work, didn't work.
p181
aVAnd I ended up with three children, Houston, Myesha and Dominic,
p182
aVwho was four months old when I came to jail.
p183
aa(lp184
V"And I was in the bedroom. Like I said, he had her in the bathroom
p185
aVand he \u2014 he \u2014 every time he hit her, she would fall.
p186
aVAnd she would hit her head on the tub. It happened continuously, repeatedly.
p187
aVI could hear it, but I dared not to move. I didn't move.
p188
aVI didn't even go and see what was happening.
p189
aVI just sat there and listened.
p190
aVAnd then he put her in the hallway.
p191
aVHe told her, just set there. And so she set there for about four or five hours.
p192
aVAnd then he told her, get up.
p193
aVAnd when she got up, she says she couldn't see.
p194
aVHer face was bruised. She had a black eye.
p195
aVAll around her head was just swollen;
p196
aVher head was about two sizes of its own size.
p197
aVI told him, 'Let her go to sleep.' He let her go to sleep.
p198
aa(lp199
V"The next morning she was dead.
p200
aVHe went in to check on her for school, and he got very excited.
p201
aVHe says, 'She won't breathe.'
p202
aVI knew immediately that she was dead.
p203
aVI didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead, so I went in
p204
aVand I put a mirror to her mouth \u2014
p205
aVthere was no thing, nothing, coming out of her mouth.
p206
aVHe said, he said, he said,
p207
aV'We can't, we can't let nobody find out about this.'
p208
aVHe say, 'You've got to help me.' I agree. I agree.
p209
aa(lp210
V"I mean, I've been keeping a secret for years and years and years,
p211
aVso it just seemed like second hand to me, just to keep on keeping it a secret.
p212
aVSo we went to the mall and we told a police that we had, like, lost her,
p213
aVthat she was missing.
p214
aVWe told a security guard that she was missing,
p215
aVthough she wasn't missing.
p216
aVAnd we told the security guard what we had put on her
p217
aVand we went home and we dressed her in exactly the same thing
p218
aVthat we had told the security guard that we had put on her.
p219
aa(lp220
V"And then we got the baby and my other child,
p221
aVand we drove out to, like, I-95.
p222
aVI was so petrified and so numb,
p223
aVall I could look was in the rear-view mirror.
p224
aVAnd he just laid her right on the shoulder of the highway.
p225
aVMy own child, I let that happen to."
p226
aVSo that's an investigation of the negative imagination.
p227
aV(Applause)
p228
aa(lp229
VWhen I started this project
p230
aVcalled "On the Road: A Search For an American Character"
p231
aVwith my tape recorder, I thought that I was going to go around America
p232
aVand find it in all its aspects \u2014 bull riders, cowboys, pig farmers,
p233
aVdrum majorettes \u2014 but I sort of got tripped on race relations,
p234
aVbecause my first big show was a show about a race riot.
p235
aVAnd so I went to both \u2014 two race riots,
p236
aVone of which was the Los Angeles riot. And this next piece is from that.
p237
aVBecause this is what I would say
p238
aVI've learned the most about race relations, from this piece.
p239
aVIt's a kind of an aria, I would say, and in many tapes that I have.
p240
aa(lp241
VEverybody knows that the Los Angeles riots happened
p242
aVbecause four cops beat up a black man named Rodney King.
p243
aVIt was captured on videotape \u2014 technology \u2014
p244
aVand it was played all over the world.
p245
aVEverybody thought the four cops would go to jail.
p246
aVThey did not, so there were riots.
p247
aVAnd what a lot of people forget, is there was a second trial,
p248
aVordered by George Bush, Sr.
p249
aVAnd that trial came back with two cops going to jail
p250
aVand two cops declared innocent. I was at that trial.
p251
aVAnd I mean, the people just danced in the streets
p252
aVbecause they were afraid there was going to be another riot.
p253
aVExplosion of joy that this verdict had come back this way.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo there was a community that didn't \u2014 the Korean-Americans,
p256
aVwhose stores had been burned to the ground.
p257
aVAnd so this woman, Mrs. Young-Soon Han,
p258
aVI suppose will have taught me the most that I have learned about race.
p259
aVAnd she asks also a question that Studs talks about:
p260
aVthis notion of the "official truth," to question the "official truth."
p261
aVSo what she's questioning here, she's taking a chance
p262
aVand questioning what justice is in society.
p263
aVAnd this is called, "Swallowing the Bitterness."
p264
aa(lp265
V"I used to believe America was the best.
p266
aVI watched in Korea many luxurious Hollywood lifestyle movie.
p267
aVI never saw any poor man, any black.
p268
aVUntil 1992, I used to believe America was the best \u2014 I still do;
p269
aVI don't deny that because I am a victim.
p270
aVBut at the end of '92, when we were in such turmoil,
p271
aVand having all the financial problems, and all the mental problems,
p272
aVI began to really realize that Koreans
p273
aVare completely left out of this society and we are nothing.
p274
aVWhy? Why do we have to be left out?
p275
aVWe didn't qualify for medical treatment, no food stamp, no GR,
p276
aa(lp277
Vno welfare, anything. Many African-Americans who never work
p278
aVgot minimum amount of money to survive.
p279
aVWe didn't get any because we have a car and a house.
p280
aVAnd we are high taxpayer. Where do I find justice?
p281
aV"OK. OK? OK. OK.
p282
aVMany African-Americans probably think that they won by the trial.
p283
aVI was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict,
p284
aVand all the day they were having a party, they celebrated,
p285
aVall of South Central, all the churches. And they say,
p286
aV'Well, finally justice has been done in this society.'
p287
aVWell, what about victims' rights?
p288
aVThey got their rights by destroying innocent Korean merchants.
p289
aVThey have a lot of respect, as I do, for Dr. Martin King.
p290
aVHe is the only model for black community; I don't care Jesse Jackson.
p291
aVHe is the model of non-violence, non-violence \u2014
p292
aVand they would all like to be in his spirit.
p293
aa(lp294
V"But what about 1992? They destroyed innocent people.
p295
aVAnd I wonder if that is really justice
p296
aVfor them, to get their rights in that way.
p297
aVI was swallowing the bitterness, sitting here alone and watching them.
p298
aVThey became so hilarious, but I was happy for them.
p299
aVI was glad for them. At least they got something back, OK.
p300
aVLet's just forget about Korean victims and other victims
p301
aVwho were destroyed by them.
p302
aVThey fought for their rights for over two centuries,
p303
aVand maybe because they sacrifice other minorities,
p304
aVHispanic, Asian, we would suffer more in the mainstream.
p305
aVThat's why I understand;
p306
aVthat's why I have a mixed feeling about the verdict.
p307
aa(lp308
V"But I wish that, I wish that, I wish that
p309
aVI could be part of the enjoyment.
p310
aVI wish that I could live together with black people.
p311
aVBut after the riot, it's too much difference.
p312
aVThe fire is still there. How do you say it? [Unclear].
p313
aVIgniting, igniting, igniting fire. Igniting fire.
p314
aVIt's still there; it can burst out anytime."
p315
aVMrs. Young-Soon Han.
p316
aV(Applause)
p317
aa(lp318
VThe other reason that I don't wear shoes
p319
aVis just in case I really feel like I have to cuddle up
p320
aVand get into the feet of somebody,
p321
aVwalking really in somebody else's shoes.
p322
aVAnd I told you that in \u2014 you know, I didn't give you the year,
p323
aVbut in '79 I thought that I was going to go around
p324
aVand find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that,
p325
aVand I got sidetracked on race relations.
p326
aa(lp327
VFinally, I did find a bull rider, two years ago.
p328
aVAnd I've been going to the rodeos with him, and we've bonded.
p329
aVAnd he's the lead in an op-ed I did about the Republican Convention.
p330
aVHe's a Republican \u2014 I won't say anything about my party affiliation, but anyway \u2014
p331
aVso this is my dear, dear Brent Williams,
p332
aVand this is on toughness,
p333
aVin case anybody needs to know about being tough
p334
aVfor the work that you do. I think there's a real lesson in this.
p335
aVAnd this is called "Toughness."
p336
aa(lp337
V"Well, I'm an optimist. I mean basically I'm an optimist.
p338
aVI mean, you know, I mean, it's like my wife, Jolene,
p339
aVher family's always saying,
p340
aVyou know, you ever think he's just a born loser?
p341
aVIt seems like he has so much bad luck, you know.
p342
aVBut then when that bull stepped on my kidney, you know,
p343
aVI didn't lose my kidney \u2014 I could have lost my kidney,
p344
aVI kept my kidney, so I don't think I'm a born loser.
p345
aVI think that's good luck.
p346
aV(Laughter)
p347
aa(lp348
V"And, I mean, funny things like this happen.
p349
aVI was in a doctor's office last CAT scan,
p350
aVand there was a Reader's Digest, October 2002.
p351
aVIt was like, 'seven ways to get lucky.' And it says
p352
aVif you want to get lucky,
p353
aVyou know, you've got to be around positive people.
p354
aVI mean, like even when I told my wife that you want to come out here
p355
aVand talk to me, she's like, 'She's just talking;
p356
aVshe's just being nice to you. She's not going to do that.'
p357
aa(lp358
V"And then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out here
p359
aVand interview me and she went and looked you up on the Internet.
p360
aVShe said, 'Look who she is.
p361
aVYou're not even going to be able to answer her questions.'
p362
aV(Laughter)
p363
aVAnd she was saying you're going to make me look like an idiot
p364
aVbecause I've never been to college,
p365
aVand I wouldn't be talking professional or anything.
p366
aVI said, 'Well look, the woman talked to me for four hours.
p367
aVYou know, if I wasn't talking \u2014 you know,
p368
aVlike, you know, she wanted me to talk,
p369
aVI don't think she would even come out here.'
p370
aa(lp371
V"Confidence? Well, I think I ride
p372
aVmore out of determination than confidence.
p373
aVI mean, confidence is like, you know,
p374
aVyou've been on that bull before; you know you can ride him.
p375
aVI mean, confidence is kind of like being cocky, but in a good way.
p376
aVBut determination, you know, it's like just, you know, 'Fuck the form,
p377
aVget the horn.'
p378
aV(Laughter)
p379
aVThat's Tuff Hedeman, in the movie '8 Seconds.'
p380
aVI mean, like, Pat O'Mealey always said when I was a boy,
p381
aVhe say, 'You know, you got more try than any kid I ever seen.'
p382
aVAnd try and determination is the same thing.
p383
aVDetermination is, like, you're going to hang on that bull,
p384
aVeven if you're riding upside down.
p385
aVDetermination's like, you're going to ride
p386
aVtill your head hits the back of the dirt.
p387
aa(lp388
V"Freedom? It would have to be the rodeo.

V"Beauty? I don't think I know what beauty is.
p391
aVWell, you know, I guess that'd have to be the rodeo too.
p392
aVI mean, look how we are, the roughy family,
p393
aVpalling around and shaking hands and wrestling around me.
p394
aVIt's like, you know, racking up our credit cards on entry fees and gas.
p395
aVWe ride together, we, you know, we, we eat together
p396
aVand we sleep together.
p397
aVI mean, I can't even imagine what it's going to be like
p398
aVthe last day I rodeo. I mean, I'll be alright.
p399
aVI mean, I have my ranch and everything,
p400
aVbut I actually don't even want to think the day that comes.
p401
aVI mean, I guess it just be like \u2014
p402

p405
aVshoved my face right through the metal shoots in a \u2014
p406
aVyou know, busted my face all up and had to go to the hospital.
p407
aVAnd they had to sew me up and straighten my nose out.
p408
aVAnd I had to go and ride in the rodeo that night,
p409
aVso I didn't want them to put me under anesthesia,
p410
aVor whatever you call it. And so they sewed my face up.
p411
aVAnd then they had to straighten out my nose,
p412
aVand they took these rods and shoved them up my nose
p413
aVand went up through my brains
p414
aVand felt like it was coming out the top of my head,
p415
aVand everybody said that it should have killed me,
p416
aVbut it didn't, because I guess I have a high tolerance for pain.
p417
aV(Laughter)
p418
aVBut the good thing was, once they shoved those rods up there
p419
aVand straightened my nose out, I could breathe,
p420
aVand I hadn't been able to breathe
p421
aVsince I broke my nose in the high school rodeo."

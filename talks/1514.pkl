VI'm going to start on a slightly somber note.
p5
aVTwo thousand and seven, five years ago,
p6
aVmy wife gets diagnosed with breast cancer.
p7
aVStage IIB.
p8
aVNow, looking back, the most harrowing part of that experience
p9
aVwas not just the hospital visits \u2014
p10
aVthese were very painful for my wife, understandably so.
p11
aVIt was not even the initial shock of knowing that she had breast cancer
p12
aVat just 39 years old,
p13
aVabsolutely no history of cancer in her family.
p14
aa(lp15
VThe most horrifying and agonizing part of the whole experience
p16
aVwas we were making decisions after decisions after decisions
p17
aVthat were being thrust upon us.
p18
aVShould it be a mastectomy? Should it be a lumpectomy?
p19
aVShould it be a more aggressive form of treatment,
p20
aVgiven that it was stage IIB?
p21
aVWith all the side effects?
p22
aVOr should it be a less aggressive form of treatment?
p23
aVAnd these were being thrust upon us by the doctors.
p24
aa(lp25
VNow you could ask this question,
p26
aVwhy were the doctors doing this?
p27
aVA simplistic answer would be,
p28
aVthe doctors are doing this
p29
aVbecause they want to protect themselves legally.
p30
aVI think that is too simplistic.
p31
aVThese are well-meaning doctors,
p32
aVsome of them have gone on to become very good friends.
p33
aVThey probably were simply following the wisdom
p34
aVthat has come down through the ages,
p35
aVthis adage that when you're making decisions,
p36
aVespecially decisions of importance,
p37
aVit's best to be in charge, it's best to be in control,
p38
aVit's best to be in the driver's seat.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd we were certainly in the driver's seat,
p41
aVmaking all these decisions.
p42
aVAnd let me tell you \u2014 if some of you have been there,
p43
aVit was a most agonizing and harrowing experience.
p44
aVWhich got me thinking.
p45
aVI said, is there any validity to this whole adage
p46
aVthat when you're making decisions,
p47
aVit's best to take the driver's seat,
p48
aVbe in charge, be in control?
p49
aVOr are there contexts where we're far better off
p50
aVtaking the passenger's seat
p51
aVand have someone else drive?
p52
aVFor example, a trusted financial advisor,
p53
aVcould be a trusted doctor, etc.
p54
aVAnd since I study human decision making,
p55
aVI said, I'm going to run some studies
p56
aVto find some answers.
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd I'm going to share one of these studies with you today.
p59
aVSo, imagine that all of you are participants in the study.
p60
aVI want to tell you that what you're going to do in the study is,
p61
aVyou're going to drink a cup of tea.
p62
aVIf you're wondering why, I'll tell you why in a few seconds from now.
p63
aVYou are going to solve a series of puzzles,
p64
aVand I'm going to show you examples of these puzzles momentarily.
p65
aVAnd the more puzzles you solve,
p66
aVthe greater the chances that you'll win some prizes.
p67
aa(lp68
VNow, why do you have to consume the tea?
p69
aVWhy? Because it makes a lot of sense:
p70
aVIn order to solve these puzzles effectively, if you think about it,
p71
aVyour mind needs to be in two states simultaneously, right?
p72
aVIt needs to be alert,
p73
aVfor which caffeine is very good.
p74
aVSimultaneously, it needs to be calm \u2014
p75
aVnot agitated, calm \u2014
p76
aVfor which chamomile is very good.
p77
aa(lp78
VNow comes the between-subjects design,
p79
aVthe AB design, the AB testing.
p80
aVSo what I'm going to do is randomly assign you to one of two groups.
p81
aVSo imagine that there is an imaginary line out here,
p82
aVso everyone here will be group A,
p83
aVeveryone out here will be group B.
p84
aa(lp85
VNow, for you folks, what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you these two teas,
p86
aVand I'll go ahead and ask you to choose your tea.
p87
aVSo you can choose whichever tea you want.
p88
aVYou can decide, what is your mental state:
p89
aVOK, I choose the caffeinated tea,
p90
aVI choose the chamomile tea.
p91
aVSo you're going to be in charge, you're going to be in control,
p92
aVyou're going to be in the driver's seat.
p93
aa(lp94
VYou folks, I'm going to show you these two teas,
p95
aVbut you don't have a choice.
p96
aVI'm going to give you one of these two teas,
p97
aVand keep in mind, I'm going to pick one of these two teas
p98
aVat random for you.
p99
aVAnd you know that.
p100
aVSo if you think about it, this is an extreme-case scenario,
p101
aVbecause in the real world,
p102
aVwhenever you are taking passenger's seat,
p103
aVvery often the driver is going to be someone you trust,
p104
aVan expert, etc.
p105
aVSo this is an extreme-case scenario.
p106
aa(lp107
VNow, you're all going to consume the tea.
p108
aVSo imagine that you're taking the tea now,
p109
aVwe'll wait for you to finish the tea.
p110
aVWe'll give another five minutes for the ingredient to have its effects.
p111
aa(lp112
VNow you're going to have 30 minutes to solve 15 puzzles.
p113
aVHere's an example of the puzzle you're going to solve.
p114
aVAnyone in the audience want to take a stab?
p115
aa(lp116
VAudience member: Pulpit! Baba Shiv: Whoa! OK.
p117
aVThat's cool.
p118
aVYeah, so what we'd do if we had you who gave the answer
p119
aVas a participant,
p120
aVwe would have calibrated the difficulty level
p121
aVof the puzzles to your expertise.
p122
aVBecause we want these puzzles to be difficult.
p123
aVThese are tricky puzzles,
p124
aVbecause your first instinct is to say "tulip."
p125
aVAnd then you have to unstick yourself.
p126
aVRight?
p127
aVSo these have been calibrated to your level of expertise,
p128
aVbecause we want this to be difficult,
p129
aVand I'll tell you why, momentarily.
p130
aa(lp131
VNow, here's another example.
p132
aVAnyone? This is much more difficult.
p133
aa(lp134
VAudience member: Embark. BS: Yeah. Wow! OK.
p135
aVSo, yeah, so this is, again, difficult.
p136
aVYou'll say "kamber," then you'll go, "maker," and all that,
p137
aVand then you can unstick yourself.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo you have 30 minutes now to solve these 15 puzzles.
p140
aVNow, the question we're asking here is, in terms of the outcome \u2014
p141
aVand it comes in the number of puzzles solved \u2014
p142
aVwill you in the driver's seat end up solving more puzzles
p143
aVbecause you are in control,
p144
aVyou could decide which tea you would choose,
p145
aVor would you be better off,
p146
aVin terms of the number of puzzles solved?
p147
aVAnd, systemically, what we will show,
p148
aVacross a series of studies,
p149
aVis that you, the passengers,
p150
aVeven though the tea was picked for you at random,
p151
aVwill end up solving more puzzles than you, the drivers.
p152
aa(lp153
VWe also observe another thing,
p154
aVand that is, you folks not only are solving fewer puzzles,
p155
aVyou're also putting less juice into the task \u2014 less effort,
p156
aVyou're less persistent, and so on.
p157
aVHow do we know that?
p158
aVWell, we have two objective measures.
p159
aVOne is, what is the time, on average, you're taking
p160
aVin attempting to solve these puzzles?
p161
aVYou will spend less time compared to you.
p162
aVSecond, you have 30 minutes to solve these;
p163
aVare you taking the entire 30 minutes
p164
aVor are you giving up before the 30 minutes elapse?
p165
aVYou will be more likely to give up before the 30 minutes elapse,
p166
aVcompared to you.
p167
aVSo you're putting in less juice,
p168
aVand therefore, the outcome: fewer puzzles solved.
p169
aa(lp170
VThat brings us now to: why does this happen?
p171
aVAnd under what situations \u2014 when \u2014 would we see this pattern of results
p172
aVwhere the passenger is going to show better, more favorable outcomes,
p173
aVcompared to the driver?
p174
aa(lp175
VIt all has to do with when you face what I call the INCA.
p176
aVIt's an acronym that stands for the nature of the feedback you're getting
p177
aVafter you made the decision.
p178
aVSo if you think about it, in this particular puzzle task \u2014
p179
aVit could happen in investing in the stock market,
p180
aVvery volatile out there,
p181
aVit could be the medical situation \u2014
p182
aVthe feedback here is immediate.
p183
aVYou know the feedback, whether you're solving the puzzles or not.
p184
aa(lp185
VRight? Second, it is negative.
p186
aVRemember, the deck was stacked against you,
p187
aVin terms of the difficulty level of these puzzles.
p188
aVAnd this can happen in the medical domain.
p189
aVFor example, very early on in the treatment,
p190
aVthings are negative, the feedback, before things become positive.
p191
aVRight? It can happen in the stock market.
p192
aVVolatile stock market, getting negative feedback, it is also immediate.
p193
aVAnd the feedback in all these cases is concrete, it's unambiguous;
p194
aVyou know if you've solved the puzzles or not.
p195
aa(lp196
VNow, the added one,
p197
aVapart from this immediacy, negative, this concreteness \u2014
p198
aVnow you have a sense of agency.
p199
aVYou were responsible for your decision.
p200
aVSo what do you do?
p201
aVYou focus on the foregone option.
p202
aVYou say, you know what?
p203
aVI should have chosen the other tea.
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VThat casts your decision in doubt,
p208
aVreduces the confidence you have in the decision,
p209
aVthe confidence you have in the performance,
p210
aVthe performance in terms of solving the puzzles.
p211
aVAnd therefore less juice into the task,
p212
aVfewer puzzles solved
p213
aVand less favorable outcomes compared to you folks.
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd this can happen in the medical domain, if you think about it, right?
p216
aVA patient in the driver's seat, for example.
p217
aVLess juice, which means keeping herself or himself
p218
aVless physically fit, physically active to hasten the recovery process,
p219
aVwhich is what is often advocated.
p220
aVYou probably wouldn't do that.
p221
aVAnd therefore, there are times when you're facing the INCA,
p222
aVwhen the feedback is going to be immediate, negative, concrete
p223
aVand you have the sense of agency,
p224
aVwhere you're far better off taking the passenger's seat
p225
aVand have someone else drive.
p226
aa(lp227
VNow, I started off on a somber note.
p228
aVI want to finish up on a more upbeat note.
p229
aVIt has now been five years, slightly more than five years,
p230
aVand the good news, thank God, is that the cancer is still in remission.
p231
aa(lp232
VSo it all ends well.
p233
aVBut one thing I didn't mention was that very early on into her treatment,
p234
aVmy wife and I decided that we would take the passenger's seat.
p235
aVAnd that made so much of a difference
p236
aVin terms of the peace of mind that came with that;
p237
aVwe could focus on her recovery.
p238
aVWe let the doctors make all the decisions
p239
aVand take the driver's seat.
p240
aa(lp241
VThank you.
p242
aa(lp243
V(Applause)

VThis is a recent comic strip from the Los Angeles Times.
p5
aVThe punch line?
p6
aV"On the other hand, I don't have to get up at four
p7
aVevery single morning to milk my Labrador."
p8
aVThis is a recent cover of New York Magazine.
p9
aVBest hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment,
p10
aVbirths, strokes, heart disease, hip replacements, 4 a.m. emergencies.
p11
aVAnd this is a song medley I put together \u2014
p12
aa(lp13
V(Music)
p14
aa(lp15
VDid you ever notice that four in the morning has become
p16
aVsome sort of meme or shorthand?
p17
aVIt means something like you are awake at the worst possible hour.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VA time for inconveniences, mishaps, yearnings.
p22
aVA time for plotting to whack the chief of police,
p23
aVlike in this classic scene from "The Godfather."
p24
aVCoppola's script describes these guys as, "exhausted in shirt sleeves.
p25
aVIt is four in the morning."
p26
aa(lp27
V(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VA time for even grimmer stuff than that,
p30
aVlike autopsies and embalmings in Isabel Allende's
p31
aV"The House of the Spirits."
p32
aVAfter the breathtaking green-haired Rosa is murdered,
p33
aVthe doctors preserve her with unguents and morticians' paste.
p34
aVThey worked until four o'clock in the morning.
p35
aa(lp36
VA time for even grimmer stuff than that,
p37
aVlike in last April's New Yorker magazine.
p38
aVThis short fiction piece by Martin Amis
p39
aVstarts out, "On September 11, 2001, he opened his eyes
p40
aVat 4 a.m. in Portland, Maine,
p41
aVand Mohamed Atta's last day began."
p42
aVFor a time that I find to be the most placid
p43
aVand uneventful hour of the day, four in the morning sure gets
p44
aVan awful lot of bad press \u2014
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
Vacross a lot of different media from a lot of big names.
p49
aVAnd it made me suspicious.
p50
aVI figured, surely some of the most creative artistic minds in the world, really,
p51
aVaren't all defaulting back to this one easy trope
p52
aVlike they invented it, right?
p53
aVCould it be there is something more going on here?
p54
aVSomething deliberate, something secret,
p55
aVand who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway?
p56
aVI say this guy \u2014 Alberto Giacometti, shown here
p57
aVwith some of his sculptures on the Swiss 100 franc note.
p58
aVHe did it with this famous piece
p59
aVfrom the New York Museum of Modern Art.
p60
aVIts title \u2014 "The Palace at Four in the Morning \u2014
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
V1932.
p65
aVNot just the earliest cryptic reference
p66
aVto four in the morning I can find.
p67
aVI believe that this so-called first surrealist sculpture
p68
aVmay provide an incredible key to virtually
p69
aVevery artistic depiction of four in the morning to follow it.
p70
aVI call this The Giacometti Code, a TED exclusive.
p71
aVNo, feel free to follow along on your Blackberries
p72
aVor your iPhones if you've got them.
p73
aa(lp74
VIt works a little something like \u2014 this is a recent Google search
p75
aVfor four in the morning.
p76
aVResults vary, of course. This is pretty typical.
p77
aVThe top 10 results yield you
p78
aVfour hits for Faron Young's song, "It's Four in the Morning,"
p79
aVthree hits for Judi Dench's film, "Four in the Morning,"
p80
aVone hit for Wislawa Szymborska's poem, "Four in the Morning."
p81
aVBut what, you may ask, do a Polish poet, a British Dame,
p82
aVa country music hall of famer all have in common
p83
aVbesides this totally excellent Google ranking?
p84
aa(lp85
VWell, let's start with Faron Young \u2014 who was born incidentally
p86
aVin 1932.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VIn 1996, he shot himself in the head on December ninth \u2014
p91
aVwhich incidentally is Judi Dench's birthday.
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VBut he didn't die on Dench's birthday.
p96
aVHe languished until the following afternoon when he finally succumbed
p97
aVto a supposedly self-inflicted gunshot wound at the age of 64 \u2014
p98
aVwhich incidentally is how old Alberto Giacometti was when he died.
p99
aa(lp100
VWhere was Wislawa Szymborska during all this?
p101
aVShe has the world's most absolutely watertight alibi.
p102
aVOn that very day, December 10, 1996 while Mr. Four in the Morning,
p103
aVFaron Young, was giving up the ghost in Nashville, Tennessee,
p104
aVMs. Four in the Morning \u2014 or one of them anyway \u2014 Wislawa Szymborska
p105
aVwas in Stockholm, Sweden, accepting the Nobel Prize for Literature.
p106
aV100 years to the day after the death of Alfred Nobel himself.
p107
aVCoincidence? No, it's creepy.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VCoincidence to me has a much simpler metric.
p112
aVThat's like me telling you,
p113
aV"Hey, you know the Nobel Prize was established in 1901,
p114
aVwhich coincidentally is the same year Alberto Giacometti was born?"
p115
aVNo, not everything fits so tidily into the paradigm,
p116
aVbut that does not mean there's not something going on
p117
aVat the highest possible levels.
p118
aVIn fact there are people in this room
p119
aVwho may not want me to show you this clip we're about to see.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VVideo: Homer Simpson: We have a tennis court, a swimming pool, a screening room \u2014
p124
aVYou mean if I want pork chops, even in the middle of the night,
p125
aVyour guy will fry them up?
p126
aa(lp127
VHerbert Powell: Sure, that's what he's paid for.
p128
aVNow do you need towels, laundry, maids?
p129
aa(lp130
VHS: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait \u2014 let me see if I got this straight.
p131
aVIt is Christmas Day, 4 a.m.
p132
aVThere's a rumble in my stomach.
p133
aa(lp134
VMarge Simpson: Homer, please.
p135
aa(lp136
VRives: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
p137
aVLet me see if I got this straight, Matt.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VWhen Homer Simpson needs to imagine
p142
aVthe most remote possible moment of not just the clock,
p143
aVbut the whole freaking calendar, he comes up with 0400
p144
aVon the birthday of the Baby Jesus.
p145
aVAnd no, I don't know how it works
p146
aVinto the whole puzzling scheme of things, but obviously
p147
aVI know a coded message when I see one.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VI said, I know a coded message when I see one.
p152
aVAnd folks, you can buy a copy of Bill Clinton's "My Life"
p153
aVfrom the bookstore here at TED.
p154
aVParse it cover to cover for whatever hidden references you want.
p155
aVOr you can go to the Random House website where there is this excerpt.
p156
aVAnd how far down into it you figure we'll have to scroll
p157
aVto get to the golden ticket?
p158
aVWould you believe about a dozen paragraphs?
p159
aVThis is page 474 on your paperbacks if you're following along:
p160
aV"Though it was getting better, I still wasn't satisfied
p161
aVwith the inaugural address.
p162
aVMy speechwriters must have been tearing their hair out
p163
aVbecause as we worked between one and four in the morning
p164
aVon Inauguration Day, I was still changing it."
p165
aa(lp166
VSure you were, because you've prepared your entire life
p167
aVfor this historic quadrennial event that just sort of sneaks up on you.
p168
aVAnd then \u2014
p169
aa(lp170
V(Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
Vthree paragraphs later we get this little beauty:
p173
aV"We went back to Blair House to look at the speech for the last time.
p174
aVIt had gotten a lot better since 4 a.m."
p175
aVWell, how could it have?
p176
aVBy his own writing, this man was either asleep,
p177
aVat a prayer meeting with Al and Tipper or learning how to launch
p178
aVa nuclear missile out of a suitcase.
p179
aVWhat happens to American presidents at 0400 on inauguration day?
p180
aVWhat happened to William Jefferson Clinton?
p181
aVWe might not ever know.
p182
aVAnd I noticed, he's not exactly around here today
p183
aVto face any tough questions.
p184
aa(lp185
V(Laughter)
p186
aa(lp187
VIt could get awkward, right?
p188
aVI mean after all, this whole business happened on his watch.
p189
aVBut if he were here \u2014
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
Vhe might remind us, as he does in the wrap-up to his fine autobiography,
p194
aVthat on this day Bill Clinton began a journey \u2014
p195
aVa journey that saw him go on to become
p196
aVthe first Democrat president elected
p197
aVto two consecutive terms in decades.
p198
aVIn generations.
p199
aVThe first since this man, Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
p200
aVwho began his own unprecedented journey
p201
aVway back at his own first election,
p202
aVway back in a simpler time, way back in 1932 \u2014
p203
aV(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
Vthe year Alberto Giacometti
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
Vmade "The Palace at Four in the Morning."
p210
aVThe year, let's remember, that this voice, now departed,
p211
aVfirst came a-cryin' into this big old crazy world of ours.

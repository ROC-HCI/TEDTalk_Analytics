VI'm a filmmaker.
p5
aVFor the last 8 years,
p6
aVI have dedicated my life
p7
aVto documenting the work
p8
aVof Israelis and Palestinians
p9
aVwho are trying to end the conflict
p10
aVusing peaceful means.
p11
aVWhen I travel with my work
p12
aVacross Europe and the United States,
p13
aVone question always comes up:
p14
aVWhere is the Palestinian Gandhi?
p15
aVWhy aren't Palestinians
p16
aVusing nonviolent resistance?
p17
aa(lp18
VThe challenge I face when I hear this question
p19
aVis that often I have just returned from the Middle East
p20
aVwhere I spent my time
p21
aVfilming dozens of Palestinians
p22
aVwho are using nonviolence
p23
aVto defend their lands
p24
aVand water resources
p25
aVfrom Israeli soldiers and settlers.
p26
aVThese leaders are trying to forge
p27
aVa massive national nonviolent movement
p28
aVto end the occupation
p29
aVand build peace in the region.
p30
aVYet, most of you
p31
aVhave probably never heard about them.
p32
aVThis divide between what's happening on the ground
p33
aVand perceptions abroad
p34
aVis one of the key reasons
p35
aVwhy we don't have yet
p36
aVa Palestinian peaceful resistance movement
p37
aVthat has been successful.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo I'm here today
p40
aVto talk about the power of attention,
p41
aVthe power of your attention,
p42
aVand the emergence and development
p43
aVof nonviolent movements
p44
aVin the West Bank, Gaza and elsewhere \u2014
p45
aVbut today, my case study is going to be Palestine.
p46
aVI believe that what's mostly missing
p47
aVfor nonviolence to grow
p48
aVis not for Palestinians
p49
aVto start adopting nonviolence,
p50
aVbut for us to start paying attention
p51
aVto those who already are.
p52
aVAllow me to illustrate this point
p53
aVby taking you to this village
p54
aVcalled Budrus.
p55
aa(lp56
VAbout seven years ago,
p57
aVthey faced extinction,
p58
aVbecause Israel announced it would build a separation barrier,
p59
aVand part of this barrier
p60
aVwould be built on top of the village.
p61
aVThey would lose 40 percent of their land
p62
aVand be surrounded,
p63
aVso they would lose free access
p64
aVto the rest of the West Bank.
p65
aVThrough inspired local leadership,
p66
aVthey launched a peaceful resistance campaign
p67
aVto stop that from happening.
p68
aa(lp69
VLet me show you some brief clips,
p70
aVso you have a sense
p71
aVfor what that actually looked like on the ground.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Music)
p74
aa(lp75
VPalestinian Woman: We were told the wall
p76
aVwould separate Palestine from Israel.
p77
aVHere in Budrus,
p78
aVwe realized the wall would steal our land.
p79
aa(lp80
VIsraeli Man: The fence has, in fact,
p81
aVcreated a solution to terror.
p82
aa(lp83
VMan: Today you're invited
p84
aVto a peaceful march.
p85
aVYou are joined
p86
aVby dozens of your Israeli brothers and sisters.
p87
aa(lp88
VIsraeli Activist: Nothing scares the army
p89
aVmore than nonviolent opposition.
p90
aa(lp91
VWoman: We saw the men
p92
aVtrying to push the soldiers,
p93
aVbut none of them could do that.
p94
aVBut I think the girls could do it.
p95
aa(lp96
VFatah Party Member: We must empty our minds
p97
aVof traditional thinking.
p98
aa(lp99
VHamas Party Member: We were in complete harmony,
p100
aVand we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine.
p101
aa(lp102
VChanting: One united nation.
p103
aVFatah, Hamas and the Popular Front!
p104
aVNews Anchor: The clashes over the fence continue.
p105
aa(lp106
VReporter: Israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd.
p107
aVThey were allowed to use any force necessary.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Gunshots)
p110
aa(lp111
VMan: These are live bullets.
p112
aVIt's like Fallujah. Shooting everywhere.
p113
aa(lp114
VIsraeli Activist: I was sure we were all going to die.
p115
aVBut there were others around me who weren't even cowering.
p116
aa(lp117
VIsraeli Soldier: A nonviolent protest
p118
aVis not going to stop the [unclear].
p119
aa(lp120
VProtester: This is a peaceful march.
p121
aVThere is no need to use violence.
p122
aa(lp123
VChanting: We can do it! We can do it!
p124
aVWe can do it!
p125
aa(lp126
VJulia Bacha: When I first heard
p127
aVabout the story of Budrus,
p128
aVI was surprised
p129
aVthat the international media had failed to cover
p130
aVthe extraordinary set of events
p131
aVthat happened seven years ago,
p132
aVin 2003.
p133
aVWhat was even more surprising
p134
aVwas the fact that Budrus was successful.
p135
aVThe residents, after 10 months of peaceful resistance,
p136
aVconvinced the Israeli government
p137
aVto move the route of the barrier off their lands
p138
aVand to the green line,
p139
aVwhich is the internationally recognized boundary
p140
aVbetween Israel and the Palestinian Territories.
p141
aVThe resistance in Budrus
p142
aVhas since spread
p143
aVto villages across the West Bank
p144
aVand to Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem.
p145
aVYet the media remains mostly silent
p146
aVon these stories.
p147
aVThis silence carries profound consequences
p148
aVfor the likelihood
p149
aVthat nonviolence can grow,
p150
aVor even survive,
p151
aVin Palestine.
p152
aa(lp153
VViolent resistance
p154
aVand nonviolent resistance
p155
aVshare one very important thing in common;
p156
aVthey are both a form of theater
p157
aVseeking an audience to their cause.
p158
aVIf violent actors
p159
aVare the only ones constantly getting front-page covers
p160
aVand attracting international attention
p161
aVto the Palestinian issue,
p162
aVit becomes very hard
p163
aVfor nonviolent leaders
p164
aVto make the case to their communities
p165
aVthat civil disobedience
p166
aVis a viable option
p167
aVin addressing their plight.
p168
aa(lp169
VThe power of attention
p170
aVis probably going to come as no surprise
p171
aVto the parents in the room.
p172
aVThe surest way
p173
aVto make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums
p174
aVis by giving him attention
p175
aVthe first time he throws a fit.
p176
aVThe tantrum will become
p177
aVwhat childhood psychologists call
p178
aVa functional behavior,
p179
aVsince the child has learned
p180
aVthat he can get parental attention out of it.
p181
aVParents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior
p182
aVsimply by giving or withdrawing
p183
aVattention to their children.
p184
aVBut that's true for adults too.
p185
aVIn fact, the behavior
p186
aVof entire communities and countries
p187
aVcan be influenced,
p188
aVdepending on where
p189
aVthe international community chooses
p190
aVto focus its attention.
p191
aa(lp192
VI believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the Middle East
p193
aVand bringing peace
p194
aVis for us
p195
aVto transform nonviolence
p196
aVinto a functional behavior
p197
aVby giving a lot more attention
p198
aVto the nonviolent leaders on the ground today.
p199
aVIn the course of taking my film to villages
p200
aVin the West Bank, in Gaza and in East Jerusalem,
p201
aVI have seen the impact
p202
aVthat even one documentary film can have
p203
aVin influencing the transformation.
p204
aa(lp205
VIn a village called Wallajeh,
p206
aVwhich sits very close to Jerusalem,
p207
aVthe community was facing
p208
aVa very similar plight to Budrus.
p209
aVThey were going to be surrounded, lose a lot of their lands
p210
aVand not have freedom of access,
p211
aVeither to the West Bank or Jerusalem.
p212
aVThey had been using nonviolence for about two years
p213
aVbut had grown disenchanted
p214
aVsince nobody was paying attention.
p215
aVSo we organized a screening.
p216
aVA week later,
p217
aVthey held the most well-attended
p218
aVand disciplined
p219
aVdemonstration to date.
p220
aVThe organizers say
p221
aVthat the villagers, upon seeing the story of Budrus
p222
aVdocumented in a film,
p223
aVfelt that there were indeed people
p224
aVfollowing what they were doing,
p225
aVthat people cared.
p226
aVSo they kept on going.
p227
aa(lp228
VOn the Israeli side,
p229
aVthere is a new peace movement called Solidariot,
p230
aVwhich means solidarity in Hebrew.
p231
aVThe leaders of this movement have been using Budrus
p232
aVas one of their primary recruiting tools.
p233
aVThey report
p234
aVthat Israelis who had never been active before,
p235
aVupon seeing the film,
p236
aVunderstand the power of nonviolence
p237
aVand start joining their activities.
p238
aVThe examples of Wallajeh
p239
aVand the Solidariot movement
p240
aVshow that even a small-budget independent film
p241
aVcan play a role
p242
aVin transforming nonviolence
p243
aVinto a functional behavior.
p244
aVNow imagine the power
p245
aVthat big media players could have
p246
aVif they started covering
p247
aVthe weekly nonviolent demonstrations
p248
aVhappening in villages
p249
aVlike Bil'in, Ni'lin,
p250
aVWallajeh,
p251
aVin Jerusalem neighborhoods
p252
aVlike Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan \u2014
p253
aVthe nonviolent leaders
p254
aVwould become more visible,
p255
aVvalued and effective
p256
aVin their work.
p257
aa(lp258
VI believe
p259
aVthat the most important thing
p260
aVis to understand
p261
aVthat if we don't pay attention to these efforts,
p262
aVthey are invisible,
p263
aVand it's as if they never happened.
p264
aVBut I have seen first hand
p265
aVthat if we do,
p266
aVthey will multiply.
p267
aVIf they multiply,
p268
aVtheir influence will grow
p269
aVin the overall Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
p270
aVAnd theirs is the kind of influence
p271
aVthat can finally
p272
aVunblock the situation.
p273
aVThese leaders have proven that nonviolence works
p274
aVin places like Budrus.
p275
aVLet's give them attention
p276
aVso they can prove it works everywhere.
p277
aa(lp278
VThank you.

VI'm the luckiest guy in the world.
p5
aVI got to see the last case of killer smallpox in the world.
p6
aVI was in India this past year,
p7
aVand I may have seen the last cases of polio in the world.
p8
aVThere's nothing that makes you feel more \u2014
p9
aVthe blessing and the honor of working in a program like that \u2014
p10
aVthan to know that something that horrible no longer exists.
p11
aVSo I'm going to tell you \u2014
p12
aV(Applause)
p13
aVso I'm going to show you some dirty pictures.
p14
aVThey are difficult to watch, but you should look at them with optimism,
p15
aVbecause the horror of these pictures will be matched
p16
aVby the uplifting quality of knowing that they no longer exist.
p17
aa(lp18
VBut first, I'm going to tell you a little bit about my own journey.
p19
aVMy background is not exactly the conventional medical education
p20
aVthat you might expect.
p21
aVWhen I was an intern in San Francisco,
p22
aVI heard about a group of Native Americans who had taken over Alcatraz Island,
p23
aVand a Native American who wanted to give birth on that island,
p24
aVand no other doctor wanted to go and help her give birth.
p25
aVI went out to Alcatraz, and I lived on the island for several weeks.
p26
aVShe gave birth; I caught the baby; I got off the island;
p27
aVI landed in San Francisco;
p28
aVand all the press wanted to talk to me,
p29
aVbecause my three weeks on the island made me an expert in Indian affairs.
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VI wound up on every television show.
p33
aVSomeone saw me on television; they called me up; and they asked me
p34
aVif I'd like to be in a movie and to play a young doctor
p35
aVfor a bunch of rock and roll stars who were traveling in a bus ride
p36
aVfrom San Francisco to England.
p37
aVAnd I said, yes, I would do that,
p38
aVso I became the doctor in an absolutely awful movie
p39
aVcalled "Medicine Ball Caravan."
p40
aV(Laughter)
p41
aVNow, you know from the '60s,
p42
aVyou're either on the bus or you're off the bus; I was on the bus.
p43
aVMy wife of 37 years and I joined the bus.
p44
aVOur bus ride took us from San Francisco to London,
p45
aVthen we switched buses at the big pond.
p46
aVWe then got on two more buses
p47
aVand we drove through Turkey and Iran, Afghanistan,
p48
aVover the Khyber Pass into Pakistan, like every other young doctor.
p49
aVThis is us at the Khyber Pass, and that's our bus.
p50
aVWe had some difficulty getting over the Khyber Pass.
p51
aVBut we wound up in India.
p52
aVAnd then, like everyone else in our generation,
p53
aVwe went to live in a Himalayan monastery.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VThis is just like a residency program,
p58
aVfor those of you that are in medical school.
p59
aV(Laughter)
p60
aVAnd we studied with a wise man, a guru named Karoli Baba,
p61
aVwho then told me to get rid of the dress,
p62
aVput on a three-piece suit,
p63
aVgo join the United Nations as a diplomat
p64
aVand work for the World Health Organization.
p65
aVAnd he made an outrageous prediction that smallpox would be eradicated,
p66
aVand that this was God's gift to humanity,
p67
aVbecause of the hard work of dedicated scientists.
p68
aVAnd that prediction came true.
p69
aVThis little girl is Rahima Banu,
p70
aVand she was the last case of killer smallpox in the world.
p71
aVAnd this document is the certificate that the global commission signed,
p72
aVcertifying the world to have eradicated the first disease in history.
p73
aa(lp74
VThe key to eradicating smallpox was early detection, early response.
p75
aVI'm going to ask you to repeat that: early detection, early response.
p76
aVCan you say that?
p77
aa(lp78
VAudience: Early detection, early response.
p79
aa(lp80
VLarry Brilliant: Smallpox was the worst disease in history.
p81
aVIt killed more people than all the wars in history.
p82
aVIn the last century, it killed 500 million people.
p83
aVYou're reading about Larry Page already.
p84
aVSomebody reads very fast.
p85
aV(Laughter)
p86
aVIn the year that Larry Page and Sergey Brin \u2014
p87
aVwith whom I have a certain affection and a new affiliation \u2014
p88
aVin the year in which they were born,
p89
aVtwo million people died of smallpox.
p90
aVWe declared smallpox eradicated in 1980.
p91
aVThis is the most important slide that I've ever seen in public health,
p92
aV[Sovereigns killed by smallpox] because it shows you
p93
aVto be the richest and the strongest,
p94
aVand to be kings and queens of the world,
p95
aVdid not protect you from dying of smallpox.
p96
aVNever can you doubt that we are all in this together.
p97
aa(lp98
VBut to see smallpox from the perspective of a sovereign
p99
aVis the wrong perspective.
p100
aVYou should see it from the perspective of a mother,
p101
aVwatching her child develop this disease and standing by helplessly.
p102
aVDay one, day two, day three,
p103
aVday four, day five, day six.
p104
aVYou're a mother and you're watching your child,
p105
aVand on day six, you see pustules that become hard.
p106
aVDay seven, they show the classic scars of smallpox umbilication.
p107
aVDay eight.
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd Al Gore said earlier
p110
aVthat the most photographed image in the world,
p111
aVthe most printed image in the world,
p112
aVwas that of the Earth.
p113
aVBut this was in 1974, and as of that moment,
p114
aVthis photograph was the photograph that was the most widely printed,
p115
aVbecause we printed two billion copies of this photograph,
p116
aVand we took them hand to hand, door to door,
p117
aVto show people and ask them if there was smallpox in their house,
p118
aVbecause that was our surveillance system.
p119
aVWe didn't have Google, we didn't have web crawlers,
p120
aVwe didn't have computers.
p121
aa(lp122
VBy day nine \u2014 you look at this picture and you're horrified;
p123
aVI look at this picture and I say, "Thank God,"
p124
aVbecause it's clear that this is only an ordinary case of smallpox,
p125
aVand I know this child will live.
p126
aVAnd by day 13, the lesions are scabbing, his eyelids are swollen,
p127
aVbut you know this child has no other secondary infection.
p128
aVAnd by day 20, while he will be scarred for life, he will live.
p129
aa(lp130
VThere are other kinds of smallpox that are not like that.
p131
aVThis is confluent smallpox,
p132
aVin which there isn't a single place on the body where you could put a finger
p133
aVand not be covered by lesions.
p134
aVFlat smallpox, which killed 100 percent of people who got it.
p135
aVAnd hemorrhagic smallpox, the most cruel of all,
p136
aVwhich had a predilection for pregnant women.
p137
aVI've probably had 50 women die.
p138
aVThey all had hemorrhagic smallpox.
p139
aVI've never seen anybody die from it who wasn't a pregnant woman.
p140
aa(lp141
VIn 1967, the WHO embarked on what was an outrageous program
p142
aVto eradicate a disease.
p143
aVIn that year, there were 34 countries affected with smallpox.
p144
aVBy 1970, we were down to 18 countries.
p145
aV1974, we were down to five countries.
p146
aVBut in that year, smallpox exploded throughout India.
p147
aVAnd India was the place where smallpox made its last stand.
p148
aVIn 1974, India had a population of 600 million.
p149
aVThere are 21 linguistic states in India,
p150
aVwhich is like saying 21 different countries.
p151
aVThere are 20 million people on the road at any time,
p152
aVin buses and trains, walking; 500,000 villages, 120 million households,
p153
aVand none of them wanted to report
p154
aVif they had a case of smallpox in their house,
p155
aVbecause they thought that smallpox was the visitation of a deity,
p156
aVShitala Mata, the cooling mother,
p157
aVand it was wrong to bring strangers into your house
p158
aVwhen the deity was in the house.
p159
aVNo incentive to report smallpox.
p160
aa(lp161
VIt wasn't just India that had smallpox deities;
p162
aVsmallpox deities were prevalent all over the world.
p163
aVSo, how we eradicated smallpox was \u2014
p164
aVmass vaccination wouldn't work.
p165
aVYou could vaccinate everybody in India,
p166
aVbut one year later there'd be 21 million new babies,
p167
aVwhich was then the population of Canada.
p168
aVIt wouldn't do just to vaccinate everyone.
p169
aVYou had to find every single case of smallpox in the world
p170
aVat the same time, and draw a circle of immunity around it.
p171
aVAnd that's what we did.
p172
aVIn India alone, my 150,000 best friends and I went door to door,
p173
aVwith that same picture,
p174
aVto every single house in India.
p175
aVWe made over one billion house calls.
p176
aa(lp177
VAnd in the process, I learned something very important.
p178
aVEvery time we did a house-to-house search,
p179
aVwe had a spike in the number of reports of smallpox.
p180
aVWhen we didn't search, we had the illusion that there was no disease.
p181
aVWhen we did search, we had the illusion that there was more disease.
p182
aVA surveillance system was necessary,
p183
aVbecause what we needed was early detection, early response.
p184
aVSo we searched and we searched,
p185
aVand we found every case of smallpox in India.
p186
aVWe had a reward. We raised the reward.
p187
aVWe continued to increase the reward.
p188
aVWe had a scorecard that we wrote on every house.
p189
aVAnd as we did that,
p190
aVthe number of reported cases in the world dropped to zero.
p191
aVAnd in 1980, we declared the globe free of smallpox.
p192
aa(lp193
VIt was the largest campaign in United Nations history,
p194
aVuntil the Iraq war.
p195
aV150,000 people from all over the world \u2014
p196
aVdoctors of every race, religion, culture and nation,
p197
aVwho fought side by side, brothers and sisters,
p198
aVwith each other, not against each other,
p199
aVin a common cause to make the world better.
p200
aVBut smallpox was the fourth disease that was intended for eradication.
p201
aVWe failed three other times.
p202
aVWe failed against malaria, yellow fever and yaws.
p203
aVBut soon we may see polio eradicated.
p204
aVBut the key to eradicating polio is early detection, early response.
p205
aVThis may be the year we eradicate polio.
p206
aVThat will make it the second disease in history.
p207
aVAnd David Heymann, who's watching this on the webcast \u2014
p208
aVDavid, keep on going. We're close!
p209
aVWe're down to four countries.
p210
aa(lp211
V(Applause)
p212
aa(lp213
VI feel like Hank Aaron.
p214
aVBarry Bonds can replace me any time.
p215
aa(lp216
VLet's get another disease off the list of terrible things to worry about.
p217
aVI was just in India working on the polio program.
p218
aVThe polio surveillance program is four million people going door to door.
p219
aVThat is the surveillance system.
p220
aVBut we need to have early detection, early response.
p221
aVBlindness, the same thing.
p222
aVThe key to discovering blindness is doing epidemiological surveys
p223
aVand finding out the causes of blindness,
p224
aVso you can mount the correct response.
p225
aa(lp226
VThe Seva Foundation was started by a group of alumni
p227
aVof the Smallpox Eradication Programme,
p228
aVwho, having climbed the highest mountain,
p229
aVtasted the elixir of the success of eradicating a disease,
p230
aVwanted to do it again.
p231
aVAnd over the last 27 years, Seva's programs in 15 countries
p232
aVhave given back sight to more than two million blind people.
p233
aVSeva got started because we wanted to apply these lessons
p234
aVof surveillance and epidemiology
p235
aVto something which nobody else was looking at as a public health issue:
p236
aVblindness, which heretofore had been thought of only as a clinical disease.
p237
aa(lp238
VIn 1980, Steve Jobs gave me that computer, which is Apple number 12,
p239
aVand it's still in Kathmandu, and it's still working,
p240
aVand we ought to go get it and auction it off and make more money for Seva.
p241
aVAnd we conducted the first Nepal survey ever done for health,
p242
aVand the first nationwide blindness survey ever done,
p243
aVand we had astonishing results.
p244
aVInstead of finding out what we thought was the case \u2014
p245
aVthat blindness was caused mostly by glaucoma and trachoma \u2014
p246
aVwe were astounded to find out
p247
aVthat blindness was caused instead by cataract.
p248
aVYou can't cure or prevent what you don't know is there.
p249
aa(lp250
VIn your TED packages there's a DVD, "Infinite Vision,"
p251
aVabout Dr. V and the Aravind Eye Hospital.
p252
aVI hope that you will take a look at it.
p253
aVAravind, which started as a Seva project,
p254
aVis now the world's largest and best eye hospital.
p255
aVThis year, that one hospital will give back sight
p256
aVto more than 300,000 people in Tamil Nadu, India.
p257
aV(Applause)
p258
aVBird flu.
p259
aVI stand here as a representative of all terrible things \u2014
p260
aVthis might be the worst.
p261
aVThe key to preventing or mitigating pandemic bird flu
p262
aVis early detection and rapid response.
p263
aVWe will not have a vaccine or adequate supplies of an antiviral
p264
aVto combat bird flu if it occurs in the next three years.
p265
aVWHO stages the progress of a pandemic.
p266
aVWe are now at stage three on the pandemic alert stage,
p267
aVwith just a little bit of human-to-human transmission,
p268
aVbut no human-to-human-to-human sustained transmission.
p269
aa(lp270
VThe moment WHO says we've moved to category four \u2014
p271
aVthis will not be like Katrina.
p272
aVThe world as we know it will stop.
p273
aVThere'll be no airplanes flying.
p274
aVWould you get in an airplane with 250 people you didn't know,
p275
aVcoughing and sneezing,
p276
aVwhen you knew that some of them might carry a disease that could kill you,
p277
aVfor which you had no antivirals or vaccine?
p278
aVI did a study of the top epidemiologists in the world in October.
p279
aVI asked them \u2014 these are all fluologists and specialists in influenza \u2014
p280
aVand I asked them the questions you'd like to ask them:
p281
aVWhat do you think the likelihood is that there'll be a pandemic?
p282
aVIf it happens, how bad do you think it will be?
p283
aa(lp284
VFifteen percent said they thought there'd be a pandemic within three years.
p285
aVBut much worse than that,
p286
aV90 percent said they thought there'd be a pandemic
p287
aVwithin your children or your grandchildren's lifetime.
p288
aVAnd they thought that if there was a pandemic,
p289
aVa billion people would get sick.
p290
aVAs many as 165 million people would die.
p291
aVThere would be a global recession and depression
p292
aVas our just-in-time inventory system
p293
aVand the tight rubber band of globalization broke,
p294
aVand the cost to our economy of one to three trillion dollars
p295
aVwould be far worse for everyone than merely 100 million people dying,
p296
aVbecause so many more people would lose their job
p297
aVand their healthcare benefits,
p298
aVthat the consequences are almost unthinkable.
p299
aVAnd it's getting worse, because travel is getting so much better.
p300
aa(lp301
VLet me show you a simulation of what a pandemic looks like.
p302
aVSo we know what we're talking about.
p303
aVLet's assume, for example, that the first case occurs in South Asia.
p304
aVIt initially goes quite slowly.
p305
aVYou get two or three discrete locations.
p306
aVThen there'll be secondary outbreaks, and the disease will spread
p307
aVfrom country to country so fast that you won't know what hit you.
p308
aVWithin three weeks it will be everywhere in the world.
p309
aVNow, if we had an "undo" button, and we could go back and isolate it
p310
aVand grab it when it first started \u2014 if we could find it early,
p311
aVand we had early detection and early response,
p312
aVand we could put each one of those viruses in jail \u2014
p313
aVthat's the only way to deal with something like a pandemic.
p314
aVAnd let me show you why that is.
p315
aa(lp316
VWe have a joke.
p317
aVThis is an epidemic curve, and everyone in medicine,
p318
aVI think, ultimately gets to know what it is.
p319
aVBut the joke is,
p320
aVan epidemiologist likes to arrive at an epidemic right here
p321
aVand ride to glory on the downhill curve.
p322
aV(Laughter)
p323
aVBut you don't get to do that usually.
p324
aVYou usually arrive right about here.
p325
aVWhat we really want is to arrive right here, so we can stop the epidemic.
p326
aVBut you can't always do that.
p327
aVBut there's an organization that has been able to find a way
p328
aVto learn when the first cases occur,
p329
aVand that is called GPHIN;
p330
aVit's the Global Public Health Information Network.
p331
aVAnd that simulation that I showed you
p332
aVthat you thought was bird flu \u2014 that was SARS.
p333
aVAnd SARS is the pandemic that did not occur.
p334
aVAnd it didn't occur
p335
aVbecause GPHIN found the pandemic-to-be of SARS
p336
aVthree months before WHO actually announced it, and because of that,
p337
aVwe were able to stop the SARS pandemic.
p338
aVAnd I think we owe a great debt of gratitude
p339
aVto GPHIN and to Ron St. John,
p340
aVwho I hope is in the audience some place \u2014 over there \u2014
p341
aVwho's the founder of GPHIN.
p342
aa(lp343
V(Applause)
p344
aa(lp345
VHello, Ron!
p346
aa(lp347
V(Applause)
p348
aa(lp349
VAnd TED has flown Ron here from Ottawa, where GPHIN is located,
p350
aVbecause not only did GPHIN find SARS early,
p351
aVbut you may have seen last week
p352
aVthat Iran announced that they had bird flu in Iran,
p353
aVbut GPHIN found the bird flu in Iran not February 14 \u2014
p354
aVbut last September.
p355
aVWe need an early-warning system
p356
aVto protect us against the things that are humanity's worst nightmare.
p357
aVAnd so my TED wish is based on the common denominator
p358
aVof these experiences.
p359
aVSmallpox \u2014 early detection, early response.
p360
aVBlindness, polio \u2014 early detection, early response.
p361
aVPandemic bird flu \u2014 early detection, early response.
p362
aVIt is a litany.
p363
aVIt is so obvious that our only way of dealing with these new diseases
p364
aVis to find them early and to kill them before they spread.
p365
aa(lp366
VSo, my TED wish is for you to help build a global system \u2014
p367
aVan early-warning system \u2014
p368
aVto protect us against humanity's worst nightmares.
p369
aVAnd what I thought I would call it is "Early Detection,"
p370
aVBut it should really be called ...
p371
aV"Total Early Detection." [TED]
p372
aa(lp373
V(Laughter)
p374
aVWhat?
p375
aa(lp376
V(Applause)
p377
aVWhat?
p378
aV(Applause)
p379
aa(lp380
VBut in all seriousness,
p381
aVbecause this idea is birthed in TED,
p382
aVI would like it to be a legacy of TED, and I'd like to call it
p383
aVthe "International System for Total Early Disease Detection."
p384
aV[INSTEDD]
p385
aVAnd INSTEDD then becomes our mantra.
p386
aVSo instead of a hidden pandemic of bird flu,
p387
aVwe find it and immediately contain it.
p388
aVInstead of a novel virus caused by bio-terror or bio-error,
p389
aVor shift or drift, we find it and we contain it.
p390
aVInstead of industrial accidents like oil spills
p391
aVor the catastrophe in Bhopal,
p392
aVwe find them, and we respond to them.
p393
aVInstead of famine, hidden until it is too late,
p394
aVwe detect it, and we respond.
p395
aVAnd instead of a system which is owned by a government,
p396
aVand hidden in the bowels of government,
p397
aVlet's build an early detection system
p398
aVthat's freely available to anyone in the world in their own language.
p399
aa(lp400
VLet's make it transparent, non-governmental,
p401
aVnot owned by any single country or company,
p402
aVhoused in a neutral country, with redundant backup
p403
aVin a different time zone and a different continent.
p404
aVAnd let's build it on GPHIN.
p405
aVLet's start with GPHIN.
p406
aVLet's increase the websites that they crawl
p407
aVfrom 20,000 to 20 million.
p408
aVLet's increase the languages they crawl
p409
aVfrom seven to 70, or more.
p410
aVLet's build in outbound confirmation messages,
p411
aVusing text messages or SMS or instant messaging
p412
aVto find out from people who are within 100 meters
p413
aVof the rumor that you hear,
p414
aVif it is, in fact, valid.
p415
aVAnd let's add satellite confirmation.
p416
aVAnd we'll add Gapminder's amazing graphics to the front end.
p417
aa(lp418
VAnd we'll grow it as a moral force in the world,
p419
aVfinding out those terrible things
p420
aVbefore anybody else knows about them,
p421
aVand sending our response to them,
p422
aVso that next year, instead of us meeting here,
p423
aVlamenting how many terrible things there are in the world,
p424
aVwe will have pulled together,
p425
aVused the unique skills and the magic of this community,
p426
aVand be proud that we have done everything we can to stop pandemics,
p427
aVother catastrophes, and change the world, beginning right now.

VChris Anderson: An amazing presentation.
p432
aVFirst of all, just so everyone understands:
p433
aVyou're saying that by creating web crawlers,
p434
aVlooking on the Internet for patterns,
p435
aVthey can detect something suspicious
p436
aVbefore WHO, before anyone else can see it?
p437
aVGive an example of how that could possibly be true.

VLB: Well, as Ron St. John \u2014
p446
aVI hope you'll go and meet him in the dinner afterwards and talk to him.
p447
aVWhen he started GPHIN \u2014
p448
aVIn 1997, there was an outbreak of bird flu \u2014 H5N1.
p449
aVIt was in Hong Kong.
p450
aVAnd a remarkable doctor in Hong Kong responded immediately,
p451
aVby slaughtering 1.5 million chickens and birds,
p452
aVand they stopped that outbreak in its tracks.
p453
aVImmediate detection, immediate response.
p454
aVThen a number of years went by,
p455
aVand there were a lot of rumors about bird flu.
p456
aVRon and his team in Ottawa began to crawl the web \u2014
p457
aVonly crawling 20,000 different websites, mostly periodicals \u2014
p458
aVand they read about and heard about a concern,
p459
aVof a lot of children who had high fever and symptoms of bird flu.
p460
aa(lp461
VThey reported this to WHO.
p462
aa(lp463
VWHO took a little while taking action,
p464
aVbecause WHO will only receive a report from a government,
p465
aVbecause it's the United Nations.
p466
aVBut they were able to point to WHO and let them know
p467
aVthat there was this surprising and unexplained cluster of illnesses
p468
aVthat looked like bird flu.
p469
aVThat turned out to be SARS.
p470
aVThat's how the world found out about SARS.
p471
aVAnd because of that, we were able to stop SARS.
p472
aVNow, what's really important is that, before there was GPHIN,
p473
aV100 percent of all the world's reports of bad things \u2014
p474
aVwhether you're talking about famine
p475
aVor you're talking about bird flu or you're talking about Ebola \u2014
p476
aV100 percent of all those reports came from nations.
p477
aa(lp478
VThe moment these guys in Ottawa \u2014
p479
aVon a budget of 800,000 dollars a year \u2014 got cracking,
p480
aV75 percent of all the reports in the world came from GPHIN,
p481
aV25 percent of all the reports in the world
p482
aVcame from all the other 180 nations.
p483
aVNow, here's what's really interesting:
p484
aVafter they'd been working for a couple years,
p485
aVwhat do you think happened to those nations?
p486
aVThey felt pretty stupid.
p487
aVSo they started sending in their reports early.
p488
aVAnd now, their reporting percentage is down to 50 percent,
p489
aVbecause other nations have started to report.
p490
aVSo, can you find diseases early by crawling the web?
p491
aVOf course you can.
p492
aVCan you find it even earlier than GPHIN does now?
p493
aVOf course you can.
p494
aVYou saw that they found SARS using their Chinese web crawler
p495
aVa full six weeks before they found it using their English web crawler.
p496
aVWell, they're only crawling in seven languages.
p497
aVThese bad viruses really don't have any intention
p498
aVof showing up first in English or Spanish or French.
p499
aa(lp500
V(Laughter)
p501
aa(lp502
VSo yes, I want to take GPHIN, I want to build on it.
p503
aVI want to add all the languages of the world that we possibly can.
p504
aVI want to make this open to everybody,
p505
aVso that the health officer in Nairobi or in Patna, Bihar
p506
aVwill have as much access to it as the folks in Ottawa or in CDC.
p507
aVAnd I want to make it part of our culture
p508
aVthat there is a community of people who are watching out
p509
aVfor the worst nightmares of humanity,
p510
aVand that it's accessible to everyone.

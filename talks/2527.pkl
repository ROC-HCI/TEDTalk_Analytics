VWhen I was a kid,
p5
aVI experienced something so powerful,
p6
aVI spent the rest of my life searching for it,
p7
aVand in all the wrong places.
p8
aVWhat I experienced wasn't virtual reality.
p9
aVIt was music.
p10
aVAnd this is where the story begins.
p11
aa(lp12
VThat's me,
p13
aVlistening to the Beatles' "White Album."
p14
aVAnd the look on my face is the feeling
p15
aVthat I've been searching for ever since.
p16
aVMusic goes straight to the emotional vein,
p17
aVinto your bloodstream
p18
aVand right into your heart.
p19
aVIt deepens every experience.
p20
aVFellas?
p21
aa(lp22
V(Music)
p23
aa(lp24
VThis is the amazing McKenzie Stubbert
p25
aVand Joshua Roman.
p26
aVMusic \u2014
p27
aa(lp28
V(Applause)
p29
aa(lp30
VYeah.
p31
aa(lp32
VMusic makes everything have more emotional resonance.
p33
aVLet's see how it does for this talk.
p34
aVThe right piece of music at the right time fuses with us
p35
aVon a cellular level.
p36
aVWhen I hear that one song
p37
aVfrom that one summer
p38
aVwith that one girl,
p39
aVI'm instantly transported back there again.
p40
aVHey, Stacey.
p41
aa(lp42
VHere's a part of the story, though, where I got a little greedy.
p43
aVI thought if I added more layers on top of the music,
p44
aVI could make the feelings even more powerful.
p45
aVSo I got into directing music videos.
p46
aVThis is what they looked like.
p47
aVThat's my brother, Jeff.
p48
aVSorry about this, Jeff.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VHere's me, just so we're even.
p53
aVIncredible moves.
p54
aVShould've been a dancer.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VThese experiments grew,
p59
aVand in time, started to look more like this.
p60
aVIn both, I'm searching for the same thing, though,
p61
aVto capture that lightning in a bottle.
p62
aVExcept, I'm not.
p63
aVAdding moving pictures over the music added narrative dimension, yes,
p64
aVbut never quite equated the power
p65
aVthat just raw music had for me on its own.
p66
aVThis is not a great thing to realize when you've devoted your life
p67
aVand professional career to becoming a music video director.
p68
aVI kept asking myself, did I take the wrong path?
p69
aVSo I started thinking: if I could involve you, the audience, more,
p70
aVI might be able to make you feel something more as well.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo Aaron Koblin and I began auditioning new technologies
p73
aVthat could put more of you inside of the work,
p74
aVlike your childhood home in "The Wilderness Downtown,"
p75
aVyour hand-drawn portraits, in "The Johnny Cash Project,"
p76
aVand your interactive dreams
p77
aVin "3 Dreams of Black."
p78
aVWe were pushing beyond the screen,
p79
aVtrying to connect more deeply
p80
aVto people's hearts and imaginations.
p81
aVBut it wasn't quite enough.
p82
aVIt still didn't have the raw experiential power of pure music for me.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo I started chasing a new technology
p85
aVthat I only had read about in science fiction.
p86
aVAnd after years of searching, I found a prototype.
p87
aVIt was a project from Nonny de la Peña in Mark Bolas's lab in USC.
p88
aVAnd when I tried it, I knew I'd found it.
p89
aVI could taste the lightning.
p90
aVIt was called virtual reality.
p91
aVThis was it five years ago when I ran into it.
p92
aVThis is what it looks like now.
p93
aa(lp94
VI quickly started building things in this new medium,
p95
aVand through that process we realized something:
p96
aVthat VR is going to play an incredibly important role
p97
aVin the history of mediums.
p98
aVIn fact, it's going to be the last one.
p99
aVI mean this because it's the first medium that actually makes the jump
p100
aVfrom our internalization of an author's expression
p101
aVof an experience,
p102
aVto our experiencing it firsthand.
p103
aVYou look confused. I'll explain. Don't worry.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VIf we go back to the origins of mediums,
p108
aVby all best guesses,
p109
aVit starts around a fire, with a good story.
p110
aVOur clan leader is telling us
p111
aVabout how he hunted the woolly mammoth on the tundra that day.
p112
aVWe hear his words
p113
aVand translate them into our own internal truths.
p114
aVThe same thing happens
p115
aVwhen we look at the cave painting version of the story,
p116
aVthe book about the mammoth hunt,
p117
aVthe play,
p118
aVthe radio broadcast,
p119
aVthe television show
p120
aVor the movie.
p121
aVAll of these mediums require what we call "suspension of disbelief,"
p122
aVbecause there's a translation gap between the reality of the story
p123
aVand our consciousness interpreting the story
p124
aVinto our reality.
p125
aVI'm using the word "consciousness" as a feeling of reality that we get
p126
aVfrom our senses experiencing the world around us.
p127
aa(lp128
VVirtual reality bridges that gap.
p129
aVNow, you are on the tundra hunting with the clan leader.
p130
aVOr you are the clan leader.
p131
aVOr maybe you're even the woolly mammoth.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VSo here's what special about VR.
p136
aVIn all other mediums,
p137
aVyour consciousness interprets the medium.
p138
aVIn VR, your consciousness is the medium.
p139
aVSo the potential for VR is enormous.
p140
aVBut where are we now?
p141
aVWhat is the current state of the art?
p142
aVWell,
p143
aVwe are here.
p144
aVWe are the equivalent of year one of cinema.
p145
aVThis is the Lumière Brothers film
p146
aVthat allegedly sent a theater full of people running for their lives
p147
aVas they thought a train was coming toward them.
p148
aVSimilar to this early stage of this medium,
p149
aVin VR, we also have to move past the spectacle
p150
aVand into the storytelling.
p151
aVIt took this medium decades
p152
aVto figure out its preferred language of storytelling,
p153
aVin the form of a feature film.
p154
aVIn VR today, we're more learning grammar
p155
aVthan writing language.
p156
aa(lp157
VWe've made 15 films in the last year at our VR company, Vrse,
p158
aVand we've learned a few things.
p159
aVWe found that we have a unique, direct path into your senses,
p160
aVyour emotions, even your body.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo let me show you some things.
p163
aVFor the purpose of this demo,
p164
aVwe're going to take every direction that you could possibly look,
p165
aVand stretch it into this giant rectangle.
p166
aVOK, here we go.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo, first: camera movement is tricky in VR.
p169
aVDone wrong, it can actually make you sick.
p170
aVWe found if you move the camera at a constant speed in a straight line,
p171
aVyou can actually get away with it, though.
p172
aVThe first day in film school,
p173
aVthey told me you have to learn every single rule
p174
aVbefore you can break one.
p175
aVWe have not learned every single rule.
p176
aVWe've barely learned any at all,
p177
aVbut we're already trying to break them
p178
aVto see what kind of creative things we can accomplish.
p179
aVIn this shot here, where we're moving up off the ground, I added acceleration.
p180
aVI did that because I wanted to give you a physical sensation
p181
aVof moving up off the ground.
p182
aVIn VR, I can give that to you.
p183
aa(lp184
V(Music)
p185
aa(lp186
VNot surprisingly, music matters a lot in this medium as well.
p187
aVIt guides us how to feel.
p188
aVIn this project we made with the New York Times, Zach Richter
p189
aVand our friend, JR,
p190
aVwe take you up in a helicopter,
p191
aVand even though you're flying 2,000 feet above Manhattan,
p192
aVyou don't feel afraid.
p193
aVYou feel triumphant for JR's character.
p194
aVThe music guides you there.
p195
aa(lp196
V(Music)
p197
aa(lp198
VContrary to popular belief,
p199
aVthere is composition in virtual reality,
p200
aVbut it's completely different than in film,
p201
aVwhere you have a rectangular frame.
p202
aVComposition is now where your consciousness exists
p203
aVand how the world moves around you.
p204
aVIn this film, "Waves of Grace," which was a collaboration between Vrse,
p205
aVthe United Nations, Gabo Arora, and Imraan Ismail,
p206
aVwe also see the changing role of the close-up in virtual reality.
p207
aVA close-up in VR means you're actually close up to someone.
p208
aVIt brings that character inside of your personal space,
p209
aVa space that we'd usually reserve for the people that we love.
p210
aVAnd you feel an emotional closeness to the character
p211
aVbecause of what you feel to be a physical closeness.
p212
aa(lp213
VDirecting VR is not like directing for the rectangle.
p214
aVIt's more of a choreography of the viewer's attention.
p215
aVOne tool we can use to guide your attention
p216
aVis called "spatialized sound."
p217
aVI can put a sound anywhere in front of you, to left or right,
p218
aVeven behind you,
p219
aVand when you turn your head, the sound will rotate accordingly.
p220
aVSo I can use that to direct your attention to where I want you to see.
p221
aVNext time you hear someone singing over your shoulder,
p222
aVit might be Bono.
p223
aa(lp224
V(Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
VVR makes us feel like we are part of something.
p227
aVFor most of human history, we lived in small family units.
p228
aVWe started in caves,
p229
aVthen moved to clans and tribes, then villages and towns,
p230
aVand now we're all global citizens.
p231
aVBut I believe that we are still hardwired to care the most
p232
aVabout the things that are local to us.
p233
aVAnd VR makes anywhere and anyone feel local.
p234
aVThat's why it works as an empathy machine.
p235
aVOur film "Clouds Over Sidra" takes you to a Syrian refugee camp,
p236
aVand instead of watching a story about people over there,
p237
aVit's now a story about us here.
p238
aa(lp239
VBut where do we go from here?
p240
aVThe tricky thing is that with all previous mediums,
p241
aVthe format is fixed at its birth.
p242
aVFilm has been a sequence of rectangles,
p243
aVfrom Muybridge and his horses to now.
p244
aVThe format has never changed.
p245
aVBut VR as a format, as a medium,
p246
aVisn't complete yet.
p247
aVIt's not using physical celluloid or paper or TV signals.
p248
aVIt actually employs what we use to make sense of the world.
p249
aVWe're using your senses as the paints on the canvas,
p250
aVbut only two right now.
p251
aVEventually, we can see if we will have all of our human senses employed,
p252
aVand we will have agency to live the story in any path we choose.
p253
aVAnd we call it virtual reality right now,
p254
aVbut what happens when we move past simulated realities?
p255
aVWhat do we call it then?
p256
aVWhat if instead of verbally telling you about a dream,
p257
aVI could let you live inside that dream?
p258
aVWhat if instead of just experiencing visiting some reality on Earth,
p259
aVyou could surf gravitational waves on the edge of a black hole,
p260
aVor create galaxies from scratch,
p261
aVor communicate with each other not using words
p262
aVbut using our raw thoughts?
p263
aVThat's not a virtual reality anymore.
p264
aVAnd honestly I don't know what that's called.
p265
aVBut I hope you see where we're going.
p266
aa(lp267
VBut here I am, intellectualizing a medium I'm saying is experiential.
p268
aVSo let's experience it.
p269
aVIn your hands, you hopefully hold a piece of cardboard.
p270
aVLet's open the flap.
p271
aVTap on the power button to unlock the phone.
p272
aVFor the people watching at home,
p273
aVwe're going to put up a card right now
p274
aVto show you how to download this experience on your phone yourself,
p275
aVand even get a Google cardboard of your own to try it with.
p276
aVWe played in cardboard boxes as kids,
p277
aVand as adults, I'm hoping we can all find a little bit of that lightning
p278
aVby sticking our head in one again.
p279
aVYou're about to participate
p280
aVin the largest collective VR viewing in history.
p281
aVAnd in that classic old-timey style of yesteryear,
p282
aVwe're all going to watch something
p283
aVat the exact same time, together.
p284
aVLet's hope it works.
p285
aVWhat's the countdown look like? I can't see.
p286
aa(lp287
VAudience: ...15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9,

V(Video) JR: Let me tell you
p297
aVhow I shot the cover of the New York Times Magazine,
p298
aV"Walking New York."
p299
aVI just got strapped on outside the helicopter,
p300
aVand I had to be perfectly vertical so I could grab it.
p301
aVAnd when I was perfectly above \u2014
p302
aVyou know, with the wind, we had to redo it a few times \u2014
p303
aVthen I kept shooting.
p304
aa(lp305
V(Video) Woman's voice: Dear Lord,
p306
aVprotect us from evil,
p307
aVfor you are the Lord,
p308
aVthe light.
p309
aVYou who gave us life took it away.
p310
aVLet your will be done.
p311
aVPlease bring peace to the many who have lost loved ones.
p312
aVHelp us to live again.

V(Video) (Children's voices)
p317
aa(lp318
VChild's voice: There are more kids in Zaatari than adults right now.
p319
aVSometimes I think
p320
aVwe are the ones in charge.
p321
aa(lp322
VChris Milk: How was it?
p323
aa(lp324
V(Applause)
p325
aa(lp326
VThat was a cheap way of getting you to do a standing ovation.
p327
aVI just made you all stand. I knew you'd applaud at the end.
p328
aa(lp329
V(Applause)
p330
aa(lp331
VI believe that everyone on Earth needs to experience
p332
aVwhat you just experienced.
p333
aVThat way we can collectively start to shape this,
p334
aVnot as a tech platform
p335
aVbut as a humanity platform.
p336
aVAnd to that end, in November of last year,
p337
aVthe New York Times and Vrse made a VR project called "The Displaced."
p338
aVIt launched with one million Google Cardboards
p339
aVsent out to every Sunday subscriber with their newspaper.
p340
aVBut a funny thing happened that Sunday morning.
p341
aVA lot of people got them
p342
aVthat were not the intended recipients on the mailing label.
p343
aVAnd we started seeing this all over Instagram.
p344
aVLook familiar?
p345
aa(lp346
VMusic led me on a path
p347
aVof searching for what seemed like the unattainable
p348
aVfor a very long time.
p349
aVNow, millions of kids just had the same formative experience
p350
aVin their childhood
p351
aVthat I had in mine.
p352
aVOnly I think this one
p353
aVsurpasses it.
p354
aVLet's see
p355
aVwhere this
p356
aVleads them.
p357
aa(lp358
VThank you.

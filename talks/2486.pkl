VHow much do you need to know about a person
p5
aVbefore you'd feel comfortable making a loan?
p6
aa(lp7
VSuppose you wanted to lend 1,000 dollars
p8
aVto the person sitting two rows behind you.
p9
aVWhat would you need to know about that person
p10
aVbefore you'd feel comfortable?
p11
aa(lp12
VMy mom came to the US from India in her late thirties.
p13
aVShe's a doctor in Brooklyn,
p14
aVand she often lets friends and neighbors come to see her for health services,
p15
aVwhether they can pay right away or not.
p16
aVI remember running into her patients with her at the grocery store
p17
aVor on the sidewalk,
p18
aVand sometimes they would come and pay her right on the spot
p19
aVfor previous appointments.
p20
aVShe would thank them,
p21
aVand ask them about their families and their health.
p22
aVShe gave them credit because she trusted them.
p23
aa(lp24
VMost of us are like my mom.
p25
aVWe would give credit to someone we know
p26
aVor that we live next to.
p27
aVBut most of us are probably not going to lend to a stranger
p28
aVunless we know a little something about them.
p29
aa(lp30
VBanks, credit card companies and other financial institutions
p31
aVdon't know us on a personal level,
p32
aVbut they do have a way of trusting us,
p33
aVand that's through our credit scores.
p34
aVOur credit scores have been created
p35
aVthrough an aggregation and analysis of our public consumer credit data.
p36
aVAnd because of them, we have pretty much easy access
p37
aVto all of the goods and services that we need,
p38
aVfrom getting electricity to buying a home,
p39
aVor taking a risk and starting a business.
p40
aa(lp41
VBut ...
p42
aVthere are 2.5 billion people around the world
p43
aVthat don't have a credit score.
p44
aVThat's a third of the world's population.
p45
aVThey don't have a score
p46
aVbecause there are no formal public records on them \u2014
p47
aVno bank accounts,
p48
aVno credit histories
p49
aVand no social security numbers.
p50
aVAnd because they don't have a score,
p51
aVthey don't have access to the credit or financial products
p52
aVthat can improve their lives.
p53
aVThey are not trusted.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo we wanted to find a way to build trust
p56
aVand to open up financial access for these 2.5 billion.
p57
aVSo we created a mobile application
p58
aVthat builds credit scores for them using mobile data.
p59
aVThere are currently over one billion smartphones in emerging markets.
p60
aVAnd people are using them the same way that we do.
p61
aVThey're texting their friends, they're looking up directions,
p62
aVthey're browsing the Internet
p63
aVand they're even making financial transactions.
p64
aa(lp65
VOver time, this data is getting captured on our phones,
p66
aVand it provides a really rich picture of a person's life.
p67
aVOur customers give us access to this data
p68
aVand we capture it through our mobile application.
p69
aVIt helps us understand the creditworthiness
p70
aVof people like Jenipher, a small-business owner in Nairobi, Kenya.
p71
aVJenipher is 65 years old, and for decades has been running a food stall
p72
aVin the central business district.
p73
aVShe has three sons who she put through vocational school,
p74
aVand she's also the leader of her local chama,
p75
aVor savings group.
p76
aa(lp77
VJenipher's food stall does well.
p78
aVShe makes just enough every day to cover her expenses.
p79
aVBut she's not financially secure.
p80
aVAny emergency could force her into debt.
p81
aVAnd she has no discretionary income
p82
aVto improve her family's way of living,
p83
aVfor emergencies,
p84
aVor for investing into growing her business.
p85
aVIf Jenipher wants credit, her options are limited.
p86
aVShe could get a microloan,
p87
aVbut she'd have to form a group that could help vouch for her credibility.
p88
aVAnd even then, the loan sizes would be way too small
p89
aVto really have an impact on her business,
p90
aVaveraging around 150 dollars.
p91
aVLoan sharks are always an option,
p92
aVbut with interest rates that are well above 300 percent,
p93
aVthey're financially risky.
p94
aVAnd because Jenipher doesn't have collateral or a credit history,
p95
aVshe can't walk into a bank and ask for a business loan.
p96
aa(lp97
VBut one day,
p98
aVJenipher's son convinced her to download our application
p99
aVand apply for a loan.
p100
aVJenipher answered a few questions on her phone
p101
aVand she gave us access to a few key data points on her device.
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd here's what we saw.
p104
aVSo, bad news first.
p105
aVJenipher had a low savings balance and no previous loan history.
p106
aVThese are factors
p107
aVthat would have thrown up a red flag to a traditional bank.
p108
aVBut there were other points in her history that showed us
p109
aVa much richer picture of her potential.
p110
aVSo for one,
p111
aVwe saw that she made regular phone calls to her family in Uganda.
p112
aVWell, it turns out that the data shows
p113
aVa four percent increase in repayment
p114
aVamong people who consistently communicate with a few close contacts.
p115
aVWe could also see
p116
aVthat though she traveled around a lot throughout the day,
p117
aVshe actually had pretty regular travel patterns,
p118
aVand she was either at home or at her food stall.
p119
aVAnd the data shows a six percent increase in repayment
p120
aVamong customers who are consistent
p121
aVwith where they spend most of their time.
p122
aa(lp123
VWe could also see that she communicated a lot
p124
aVwith many different people throughout the day
p125
aVand that she had a strong support network.
p126
aVOur data shows
p127
aVthat people who communicate with more than 58 different contacts
p128
aVtend to be more likely to be good borrowers.
p129
aVIn Jenipher's case,
p130
aVshe communicated with 89 different individuals,
p131
aVwhich showed a nine percent increase in her repayment.
p132
aa(lp133
VThese are just some of the thousands of different data points
p134
aVthat we look at to understand a person's creditworthiness.
p135
aVAnd after analyzing all of these different data points,
p136
aVwe took the first risk
p137
aVand gave Jenipher a loan.
p138
aVThis is data that would not be found on a paper trail
p139
aVor in any formal financial record.
p140
aVBut it proves trust.
p141
aVBy looking beyond income,
p142
aVwe can see that people in emerging markets
p143
aVthat may seem risky and unpredictable on the surface
p144
aVare actually willing and have the capacity to repay.
p145
aa(lp146
VOur credit scores have helped us deliver over 200,000 loans in Kenya
p147
aVin just the past year.
p148
aVAnd our repayment rates are above 90 percent \u2014
p149
aVwhich, by the way, is in line with traditional bank repayment rates.
p150
aa(lp151
VWith something as simple as a credit score,
p152
aVwe're giving people the power to build their own futures.
p153
aVOur customers have used their loans for family expenses,
p154
aVemergencies, travel
p155
aVand for investing back into growing their businesses.
p156
aVThey're now building better economies and communities
p157
aVwhere more people can succeed.
p158
aa(lp159
VOver the past two years of using our product,
p160
aVJenipher has increased her savings by 60 percent.
p161
aVShe's also started two additional food stalls
p162
aVand is now making plans for her own restaurant.
p163
aVShe's applying for a small-business loan from a commercial bank,
p164
aVbecause she now has the credit history to prove she deserves it.
p165
aa(lp166
VI saw Jenipher in Nairobi just last week,
p167
aVand she told me how excited she was to get started.
p168
aVShe said,
p169
aV"Only my son believed I could do this. I didn't think this was for me."
p170
aVShe's lived her whole life
p171
aVbelieving that there was a part of the world that was closed off to her.
p172
aa(lp173
VOur job now is to open the world to Jenipher
p174
aVand the billions like her that deserve to be trusted.
p175
aa(lp176
VThank you.
p177

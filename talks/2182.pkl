VOn Mondays and Thursdays, I learn how to die.
p5
aVI call them my terminal days.
p6
aVMy wife Fernanda doesn't like the term,
p7
aVbut a lot of people in my family died of melanoma cancer
p8
aVand my parents and grandparents had it.
p9
aVAnd I kept thinking, one day I could be sitting in front of a doctor
p10
aVwho looks at my exams and says,
p11
aV"Ricardo, things don't look very good.
p12
aVYou have six months or a year to live."
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd you start thinking about what you would do with this time.
p15
aVAnd you say, "I'm going to spend  more time with the kids.
p16
aVI'm going to visit these places,
p17
aVI'm going to go up and down mountains and places
p18
aVand I'm going to do all the things I didn't do when I had the time."
p19
aVBut of course, we all know
p20
aVthese are very bittersweet memories  we're going to have.
p21
aVIt's very difficult to do.
p22
aVYou spend a good part of the time crying, probably.
p23
aVSo I said, I'm going to do something else.
p24
aa(lp25
VEvery Monday and Thursday, I'm going use my terminal days.
p26
aVAnd I will do, during those days,
p27
aVwhatever it is I was going to do if I had received that piece of news.
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VWhen you think about \u2014
p31
aV(Applause)
p32
aVwhen you think about the opposite of work,
p33
aVwe, many times, think it's leisure.
p34
aVAnd you say, ah, I need  some leisure time, and so forth.
p35
aVBut the fact is that, leisure is a very busy thing.
p36
aVYou go play golf and tennis, and you meet people,
p37
aVand you're going for lunch, and you're late for the movies.
p38
aVIt's a very crowded thing that we do.
p39
aVThe opposite of work is idleness.
p40
aVBut very few of us know what to do with idleness.
p41
aVWhen you look at the way that we distribute our lives in general,
p42
aVyou realize that in the periods in which we have a lot of money,
p43
aVwe have very little time.
p44
aVAnd then when we finally have time, we have neither the money nor the health.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo we started thinking about that as a company for the last 30 years.
p47
aVThis is a complicated company with thousands of employees,
p48
aVhundreds of millions of dollars of business
p49
aVthat makes rocket fuel propellent systems, runs 4,000 ATMs in Brazil,
p50
aVdoes income tax preparation for dozens of thousands.
p51
aVSo this is not a simple business.
p52
aa(lp53
VWe looked at it and we said,
p54
aVlet's devolve to these people, let's give these people a company
p55
aVwhere we take away all the boarding school aspects
p56
aVof, this is when you arrive, this is how you dress,
p57
aVthis is how you go to meetings, this is what you say,
p58
aVthis is what you don't say,
p59
aVand let's see what's left.
p60
aVSo we started this about 30 years ago,
p61
aVand we started dealing with this very issue.
p62
aVAnd so we said, look, the retirement,
p63
aVthe whole issue of how  we distribute our graph of life.
p64
aVInstead of going mountain climbing when you're 82,
p65
aVwhy don't you do it next week?
p66
aVAnd we'll do it like this,
p67
aVwe'll sell you back your Wednesdays for 10 percent of your salary.
p68
aVSo now, if you were going to be  a violinist, which you probably weren't,
p69
aVyou go and do this on Wednesday.
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd what we found \u2014
p72
aVwe thought, these are the older people
p73
aVwho are going to be really interested in this program.
p74
aVAnd the average age of the first people who adhered
p75
aVwere 29, of course.
p76
aVAnd so we started looking,
p77
aVand we said, we have to do things in a different way.
p78
aVSo we started saying things like,
p79
aVwhy do we want to know what time you came to work,
p80
aVwhat time you left, etc.?
p81
aVCan't we exchange this for a contract
p82
aVfor buying something from you, some kind of work?
p83
aVWhy are we building these headquarters?
p84
aVIs it not an ego issue that we want to look solid
p85
aVand big and important?
p86
aVBut we're dragging you two hours across town because of it?
p87
aa(lp88
VSo we started asking questions one by one.
p89
aVWe'd say it like this:
p90
aVOne: How do we find people?
p91
aVWe'd go out and try and recruit people and we'd say,
p92
aVlook, when you come to us,
p93
aVwe're not going to have two or three interviews
p94
aVand then you're going to be married to us for life.
p95
aVThat's not how we do  the rest of our lives.
p96
aVSo, come have your interviews.
p97
aVAnyone who's interested in interviewing, you will show up.
p98
aVAnd then we'll see what happens out of the intuition that rises from that,
p99
aVinstead of just filling out the little  items of whether you're the right person.
p100
aVAnd then, come back.
p101
aVSpend an afternoon, spend a whole day, talk to anybody you want.
p102
aVMake sure we are the bride  you thought we were
p103
aVand not all the bullshit we put into our own ads.
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VSlowly we went to a process  where we'd say things like,
p107
aVwe don't want anyone to be a leader in the company
p108
aVif they haven't been  interviewed and approved
p109
aVby their future subordinates.
p110
aVEvery six months, everyone gets  evaluated, anonymously, as a leader.
p111
aVAnd this determines whether they should continue in that leadership position,
p112
aVwhich is many times situational, as you know.
p113
aVAnd so if they don't have 70, 80 percent  of a grade, they don't stay,
p114
aVwhich is probably the reason why I haven't been CEO for more than 10 years.
p115
aVAnd over time, we started asking other questions.
p116
aa(lp117
VWe said things like,
p118
aVwhy can't people set their own salaries?
p119
aVWhat do they need to know?
p120
aVThere's only three things  you need to know:
p121
aVhow much people make inside the company,
p122
aVhow much people make somewhere else in a similar business
p123
aVand how much we make in general to see whether we can afford it.
p124
aVSo let's give people these three pieces of information.
p125
aVSo we started having, in the cafeteria,
p126
aVa computer where you could go in  and you could ask
p127
aVwhat someone spent,  how much someone makes,
p128
aVwhat they make in benefits,  what the company makes,
p129
aVwhat the margins are, and so forth.
p130
aVAnd this is 25 years ago.
p131
aa(lp132
VAs this information started  coming to people,
p133
aVwe said things like, we don't want  to see your expense report,
p134
aVwe don't want to know how many  holidays you're taking,
p135
aVwe don't want to know where you work.
p136
aVWe had, at one point, 14 different offices around town,
p137
aVand we'd say, go to the one  that's closest to your house,
p138
aVto the customer that  you're going to visit today.
p139
aVDon't tell us where you are.
p140
aVAnd more, even when we had thousands of people, 5,000 people,
p141
aVwe had two people in the H.R. department,
p142
aVand thankfully one of them has retired.
p143
aV(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd so, the question we were asking was, how can we be taking care of people?
p146
aVPeople are the only thing we have.
p147
aVWe can't have a department that runs after people and looks after people.
p148
aVSo as we started finding that this worked, and we'd say, we're looking for \u2014
p149
aVand this is, I think, the main thing I was looking for
p150
aVin the terminal days and in the company,
p151
aVwhich is, how do you set up for wisdom?
p152
aVWe've come from an age of revolution, industrial revolution,
p153
aVan age of information, an age of knowledge,
p154
aVbut we're not any closer to the age of wisdom.
p155
aVHow we design, how do we organize, for more wisdom?
p156
aVSo for example, many times,
p157
aVwhat's the smartest or the intelligent decision doesn't jive.
p158
aVSo we'd say things like,
p159
aVlet's agree that you're going to sell 57 widgets per week.
p160
aVIf you sell them by Wednesday,  please go to the beach.
p161
aVDon't create a problem for us,  for manufacturing, for application,
p162
aVthen we have to buy new companies, we have to buy our competitors,
p163
aVwe have to do all kinds of things because you sold too many widgets.
p164
aVSo go to the beach and start again on Monday.
p165
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p166
aa(lp167
VSo the process is looking for wisdom.
p168
aVAnd in the process, of course,  we wanted people to know everything,
p169
aVand we wanted to be truly democratic about the way we ran things.
p170
aVSo our board had two seats open  with the same voting rights,
p171
aVfor the first two people who showed up.
p172
aV(Laughter)
p173
aVAnd so we had cleaning ladies voting on a board meeting,
p174
aVwhich had a lot of other very important people in suits and ties.
p175
aVAnd the fact is that they kept us honest.
p176
aa(lp177
VThis process, as we started looking at the people who came to us,
p178
aVwe'd say, now wait a second,
p179
aVpeople come to us and they say, where am I supposed to sit?
p180
aVHow am I supposed to work? Where am I going to be in 5 years' time?
p181
aVAnd we looked at that and we said, we have to start much earlier.
p182
aVWhere do we start?
p183
aVWe said, oh, kindergarten  seems like a good place.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo we set up a foundation, which now has,  for 11 years, three schools,
p186
aVwhere we started asking the same questions,
p187
aVhow do you redesign school for wisdom?
p188
aVIt is one thing to say, we need to recycle the teachers,
p189
aVwe need the directors to do more.
p190
aVBut the fact is that what we do with education is entirely obsolete.
p191
aVThe teacher's role is entirely obsolete.
p192
aVGoing from a math class, to biology, to 14th-century France is very silly.
p193
aV(Applause)
p194
aVSo we started thinking,  what could it look like?
p195
aVAnd we put together people,  including people who like education,
p196
aVpeople like Paulo Freire,  and two ministers of education in Brazil
p197
aVand we said, if we were to design a school from scratch,
p198
aVwhat would it look like?
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd so we created this school, which is called Lumiar,
p201
aVand Lumiar, one of them is a public school,
p202
aVand Lumiar says the following:
p203
aVLet's divide this role of the teacher into two.
p204
aVOne guy, we'll call a tutor.
p205
aVA tutor, in the old sense of the Greek "paideia": Look after the kid.
p206
aVWhat's happening at home, what's their moment in life, etc..
p207
aVBut please don't teach,
p208
aVbecause the little you know compared  to Google, we don't want to know.
p209
aVKeep that to yourself.
p210
aV(Laughter)
p211
aVNow, we'll bring in people who have two things:
p212
aVpassion and expertise, and it could be their profession or not.
p213
aVAnd we use the senior citizens,
p214
aVwho are 25 percent of the population with wisdom that nobody wants anymore.
p215
aVSo we bring them to school and we say,
p216
aVteach these kids whatever you really believe in.
p217
aVSo we have violinists teaching math.
p218
aVWe have all kinds of things where we say,
p219
aVdon't worry about  the course material anymore.
p220
aVWe have approximately 10 great threads that go from 2 to 17.
p221
aVThings like, how do we measure ourselves as humans?
p222
aVSo there's a place for math and physics and all that there.
p223
aVHow do we express ourselves?
p224
aVSo there's a place for music and literature, etc.,
p225
aVbut also for grammar.
p226
aa(lp227
VAnd then we have things that everyone has forgotten,
p228
aVwhich are probably the most  important things in life.
p229
aVThe very important things in life, we know nothing about.
p230
aVWe know nothing about love,
p231
aVwe know nothing about death,
p232
aVwe know nothing about why we're here.
p233
aVSo we need a thread in school that talks about everything we don't know.
p234
aVSo that's a big part of what we do.
p235
aV(Applause)
p236
aVSo over the years, we started going into other things.
p237
aVWe'd say, why do we have to scold the kids
p238
aVand say, sit down and come here  and do that, and so forth.
p239
aVWe said, let's get the kids to do  something we call a circle,
p240
aVwhich meets once a week.
p241
aVAnd we'd say, you put the rules together
p242
aVand then you decide what you want to do with it.
p243
aVSo can you all hit yourself on the head?
p244
aVSure, for a week, try.
p245
aVThey came up with the very same rules that we had,
p246
aVexcept they're theirs.
p247
aVAnd then, they have the power,
p248
aVwhich means, they can and do suspend and expel kids
p249
aVso that we're not playing school, they really decide.
p250
aa(lp251
VAnd then, in this same vein,
p252
aVwe keep a digital mosaic,
p253
aVbecause this is not constructivist or Montessori or something.
p254
aVIt's something where we keep the Brazilian curriculum
p255
aVwith 600 tiles of a mosaic,
p256
aVwhich we want to expose these kids to by the time they're 17.
p257
aVAnd follow this all the time and we know how they're doing
p258
aVand we say, you're not interested  in this now, let's wait a year.
p259
aVAnd the kids are in groups that don't have an age category,
p260
aVso the six-year-old kid who is ready for that with an 11-year-old,
p261
aVthat eliminates all of the gangs and the groups
p262
aVand this stuff that we have  in the schools, in general.
p263
aVAnd they have a zero  to 100 percent grading,
p264
aVwhich they do themselves with an app every couple of hours.
p265
aVUntil we know they're 37 percent of the way we'd like them to be on this issue,
p266
aVso that we can send them out in the world with them knowing enough about it.
p267
aVAnd so the courses are World Cup Soccer, or building a bicycle.
p268
aVAnd people will sign up for  a 45-day course on building a bicycle.
p269
aVNow, try to build a bicycle without  knowing that pi is 3.1416.
p270
aVYou can't.
p271
aVAnd try, any one of you,  using 3.1416 for something.
p272
aVYou don't know anymore.
p273
aVSo this is lost and that's what  we try to do there,
p274
aVwhich is looking  for wisdom in that school.
p275
aa(lp276
VAnd that brings us back to this graph and this distribution of our life.
p277
aVI accumulated a lot of money  when I think about it.
p278
aVWhen you think and you say, now is the time to give back \u2014
p279
aVwell, if you're giving back,  you took too much.
p280
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p281
aVI keep thinking of Warren Buffet waking up one day
p282
aVand finding out he has 30 billion dollars more than he thought he had.
p283
aVAnd he looks and he says, what am I going to do with this?
p284
aVAnd he says, I'll give it to someone who really needs this.
p285
aVI'll give it to Bill Gates. (Laughter)
p286
aVAnd my guy, who's my financial advisor in New York,
p287
aVhe says, look, you're a silly guy
p288
aVbecause you would have 4.1 times  more money today
p289
aVif you had made money with money instead of sharing as you go.
p290
aVBut I like sharing as you go better.
p291
aV(Applause)
p292
aa(lp293
VI taught MBAs at MIT for a time
p294
aVand I ended up, one day, at the Mount Auburn Cemetery.
p295
aVIt is a beautiful cemetery in Cambridge.
p296
aVAnd I was walking around. It was my birthday and I was thinking.
p297
aVAnd the first time around,  I saw these tombstones
p298
aVand these wonderful people  who'd done great things
p299
aVand I thought, what do I want  to be remembered for?
p300
aVAnd I did another stroll around,
p301
aVand the second time, another question came to me,
p302
aVwhich did me better, which was,
p303
aVwhy do I want to be remembered at all?
p304
aV(Laughter)
p305
aVAnd that, I think,  took me different places.
p306
aVWhen I was 50, my wife Fernanda and I sat for a whole afternoon,
p307
aVwe had a big pit with fire,
p308
aVand I threw everything I had ever  done into that fire.
p309
aVThis is a book in 38 languages,
p310
aVhundreds and hundreds of articles and DVDs, everything there was.
p311
aVAnd that did two things.
p312
aVOne, it freed our five kids from following in our steps, our shadow \u2014
p313
aVThey don't know what I do.
p314
aV(Laughter)
p315
aVWhich is good.
p316
aVAnd I'm not going to take them somewhere
p317
aVand say, one day  all of this will be yours.
p318
aV(Laughter)
p319
aVThe five kids know nothing, which is good.
p320
aa(lp321
VAnd the second thing is,
p322
aVI freed myself from this anchor of past achievement or whatever.
p323
aVI'm free to start something new every time and to decide things from scratch
p324
aVin part of those terminal days.
p325
aVAnd some people would say,
p326
aVoh, so now you have this time, these terminal days,
p327
aVand so you go out and do everything.
p328
aVNo, we've been to the beaches,
p329
aVso we've been to Samoa and Maldives and Mozambique,
p330
aVso that's done.
p331
aVI've climbed mountains in the Himalayas.
p332
aVI've gone down 60 meters to see  hammerhead sharks.
p333
aVI've spent 59 days on the back of a camel from Chad to Timbuktu.
p334
aVI've gone to the magnetic  North Pole on a dog sled.
p335
aVSo, we've been busy.
p336
aVIt's what I'd like to call  my empty bucket list.
p337
aV(Laughter)
p338
aa(lp339
VAnd with this rationale, I look at these days and I think,
p340
aVI'm not retired.  I don't feel retired at all.
p341
aVAnd so I'm writing a new book.
p342
aVWe started three new companies in the last two years.
p343
aVI'm now working on getting this  school system for free out into the world,
p344
aVand I've found, very interestingly enough, that nobody wants it for free.
p345
aVAnd so I've been trying for 10 years
p346
aVto get the public system to take over this school rationale,
p347
aVmuch as the public schools we have,
p348
aVwhich has instead of 43 out of 100, as their rating, as their grades,
p349
aVhas 91 out of 100.
p350
aVBut for free, nobody wants it.
p351
aVSo maybe we'll start charging for it  and then it will go somewhere.
p352
aVBut getting this out is one of the things we want to do.
p353
aa(lp354
VAnd I think what this leaves us as a message for all of you,
p355
aVI think is a little bit like this:
p356
aVWe've all learned how to go on Sunday night
p357
aVto email and work from home.
p358
aVBut very few of us have learned
p359
aVhow to go to the movies on Monday afternoon.
p360
aVAnd if we're looking for wisdom, we need to learn to do that as well.
p361
aVAnd so, what we've done all of these years is very simple,
p362
aVis use the little tool, which is ask three whys in a row.
p363
aVBecause the first why you always have a good answer for.
p364
aVThe second why, it starts getting difficult.
p365
aVBy the third why, you don't really know why you're doing what you're doing.
p366
aVWhat I want to leave you with is the seed and the thought that maybe if you do this,
p367
aVyou will come to the question, what for?
p368
aVWhat am I doing this for?
p369
aVAnd hopefully, as a result of that, and over time,
p370
aVI hope that with this, and that's what I'm wishing you,
p371
aVyou'll have a much wiser future.
p372
aVThank you very much.
p373
aV(Applause)
p374
aa(lp375
VChris Anderson: So Ricardo,  you're kind of crazy.
p376
aV(Laughter)
p377
aVTo many people, this seems crazy.
p378
aVAnd yet so deeply wise, also.
p379
aVThe pieces I'm trying to put together are this:
p380
aVYour ideas are so radical.
p381
aVHow, in business, for example, these ideas have been out for a while,
p382
aVprobably the percentage of businesses  that have taken some of them
p383
aVis still quite low.
p384
aVAre there any times you've seen  some big company
p385
aVtake on one of your ideas  and you've gone, "Yes!"?
p386
aa(lp387
VRicardo Semler: It happens. It happened about two weeks ago
p388
aVwith Richard Branson, with his people saying,
p389
aVoh, I don't want to control your holidays anymore,
p390
aVor Netflix does a little bit of this and that,
p391
aVbut I don't think it's very important.
p392
aVI'd like to see it happen maybe a little bit in a bit of a missionary zeal,
p393
aVbut that's a very personal one.
p394
aVBut the fact is that it takes a leap  of faith about losing control.
p395
aVAnd almost nobody who is in control is ready to take leaps of faith.
p396
aVIt will have to come from kids  and other people
p397
aVwho are starting companies  in a different way.
p398
aa(lp399
VCA: So that's the key thing?
p400
aVFrom your point of view the evidence is there,
p401
aVin the business point of view this works,
p402
aVbut people just don't have the courage to \u2014 (Whoosh)
p403
aa(lp404
VRS: They don't even have the incentive.
p405
aVYou're running a company with a 90-day mandate.
p406
aVIt's a quarterly report.
p407
aVIf you're not good in 90 days, you're out.
p408
aVSo you say, "Here's a great program that, in less than one generation \u2014"
p409
aVAnd the guy says, "Get out of here."
p410
aVSo this is the problem.
p411
aV(Laughter)
p412
aa(lp413
VCA: What you're trying to do in education seems to me incredibly profound.
p414
aVEveryone is bothered about their country's education system.
p415
aVNo one thinks that we've caught up yet to a world
p416
aVwhere there's Google and all these  technological options.
p417
aVSo you've got actual evidence now that  the kids so far going through your system,
p418
aVthere's a dramatic increase  in performance.
p419
aVHow do we help you move these ideas forward?
p420
aa(lp421
VRS: I think it's that problem of ideas whose time has come.
p422
aVAnd I've never been very evangelical about these things.
p423
aVWe put it out there.
p424
aVSuddenly, you find people \u2014
p425
aVthere's a group in Japan,  which scares me very much,
p426
aVwhich is called the Semlerists, and they have 120 companies.
p427
aVThey've invited me. I've always been scared to go.
p428
aVAnd there is a group in Holland that has 600 small, Dutch companies.
p429
aVIt's something that will flourish on its own.
p430
aVPart of it will be wrong,  and it doesn't matter.
p431
aVThis will find its own place.
p432
aVAnd I'm afraid of the other one, which says,
p433
aVthis is so good you've got to do this.
p434
aVLet's set up a system  and put lots of money into it
p435
aVand then people will do it no matter what.
p436
aa(lp437
VCA: So you have asked  extraordinary questions your whole life.
p438
aVIt seems to me that's the fuel  that's driven a lot of this.
p439
aVDo you have any other questions for us, for TED, for this group here?
p440
aa(lp441
VRS: I always come back  to variations of the question
p442
aVthat my son asked me when he was three.
p443
aVWe were sitting in a jacuzzi, and he said, "Dad, why do we exist?"
p444
aVThere is no other question.
p445
aVNobody has any other question.
p446
aVWe have variations of this one question, from three onwards.
p447
aVSo when you spend time in a company, in a bureaucracy, in an organization
p448
aVand you're saying, boy \u2014
p449
aVhow many people do you know who on their death beds said,
p450
aVboy, I wish I had spent more time at the office?
p451
aVSo there's a whole thing  of having the courage now \u2014
p452
aVnot in a week, not in two months,
p453
aVnot when you find out  you have something \u2014
p454
aVto say, no, what am I doing this for?
p455
aVStop everything. Let me do something else.
p456
aVAnd it will be okay,
p457
aVit will be much better than what you're doing,
p458
aVif you're stuck in a process.
p459
aa(lp460
VCA: So that strikes me as a profound and quite beautiful way to end
p461
aVthis penultimate day of TED.
p462
aVRicardo Semler, thank you so much.
p463
aVRS: Thank you so much.

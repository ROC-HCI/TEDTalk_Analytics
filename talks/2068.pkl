VTalking about empowerment is odd,
p5
aVbecause when we talk about empowerment,
p6
aVwhat affects us most are the stories.
p7
aVSo I want to begin with an everyday story.
p8
aVWhat is it really like to be a young woman in India?
p9
aa(lp10
VNow, I've spent the last 27 years of my life
p11
aVin India, lived in three small towns,
p12
aVtwo major cities,
p13
aVand I've had several experiences.
p14
aVWhen I was seven,
p15
aVa private tutor who used to come home
p16
aVto teach me mathematics molested me.
p17
aVHe would put his hand up my skirt.
p18
aVHe put his hand up my skirt and told me
p19
aVhe knew how to make me feel good.
p20
aVAt 17, a boy from my high school
p21
aVcirculated an email
p22
aVdetailing all the sexually aggressive things
p23
aVhe could do to me
p24
aVbecause I didn't pay attention to him.
p25
aVAt 19, I helped a friend
p26
aVwhose parents had forcefully married her to an older man
p27
aVescape an abusive marriage.
p28
aVAt 21, when my friend and I were walking
p29
aVdown the road one afternoon,
p30
aVa man pulled down his pants
p31
aVand masturbated in front of us.
p32
aVWe called people for help, and nobody came.
p33
aVAt 25, when I was walking home one evening,
p34
aVtwo men on a motorcycle attacked me.
p35
aVI spent two nights in the hospital
p36
aVrecovering from trauma and injuries.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo throughout my life, I've seen women \u2014
p39
aVfamily, friends, colleagues \u2014
p40
aVlive through these experiences,
p41
aVand they seldom talk about it.
p42
aVSo in simple words, life in India is not easy.
p43
aVBut today I'm not going to talk to you about this fear.
p44
aVI'm going to talk to you about an interesting path
p45
aVof learning that this fear took me on.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo, what happened one night in December 2012
p48
aVchanged my life.
p49
aVSo a young girl, a 23-year-old student,
p50
aVboarded a bus in Delhi with her male friend.
p51
aVThere were six men on the bus, young men
p52
aVwho you might encounter every day in India,
p53
aVand the chilling account of what followed
p54
aVwas played over and over again
p55
aVin the Indian and international media.
p56
aVThis girl was raped repeatedly,
p57
aVforcefully penetrated with a blunt rod,
p58
aVbeaten, bitten, and left to die.
p59
aVHer friend was gagged, attacked,
p60
aVand knocked unconscious.
p61
aVShe died on the 29th of December.
p62
aVAnd at a time when most of us here
p63
aVwere preparing to welcome the new year,
p64
aVIndia plunged into darkness.
p65
aVFor the first time in our history,
p66
aVmen and women in Indian cities
p67
aVwoke up to the horrific truth
p68
aVabout the true state of women in the country.
p69
aVNow, like many other young women,
p70
aVI was absolutely terrified.
p71
aVI couldn't believe that something like this
p72
aVcould happen in a national capital.
p73
aVI was angry and I was frustrated,
p74
aVbut most of all, I felt utterly, completely helpless.
p75
aVBut really, what do you do, right?
p76
aVSome write blogs, some ignore it,
p77
aVsome join protests.
p78
aVI did all of it. In fact, that was what everyone was doing
p79
aVtwo years ago.
p80
aVSo the media was filled with stories about
p81
aVall the horrific deeds
p82
aVthat Indian men are capable of.
p83
aVThey were compared to animals,
p84
aVsexually repressed beasts.
p85
aVIn fact, so alien and unthinkable was this event
p86
aVin an Indian mind
p87
aVthat the response from the Indian media,
p88
aVpublic and politicians proved one point:
p89
aVNo one knew what to do.
p90
aVAnd no one wanted to be responsible for it.
p91
aVIn fact, these were a few insensitive comments
p92
aVwhich were made in the media
p93
aVby prominent people
p94
aVin response to sexual violence against women in general.
p95
aVSo the first one is made by a member of parliament,
p96
aVthe second one is made by a spiritual leader,
p97
aVand the third one was actually the defendants' lawyer
p98
aVwhen the girl was fighting for her life
p99
aVand she passed away.
p100
aa(lp101
VNow, as a woman watching this day after day,
p102
aVI was tired.
p103
aVSo as a writer and gender activist,
p104
aVI have written extensively on women,
p105
aVbut this time, I realized it was different,
p106
aVbecause a part of me realized
p107
aVI was a part of that young woman too,
p108
aVand I decided I wanted to change this.
p109
aVSo I did something spontaneous, hasty.
p110
aVI logged on to a citizen journalism platform
p111
aVcalled iReport,
p112
aVand I recorded a video talking about
p113
aVwhat the scene was like in Bangalore.
p114
aVI talked about how I felt,
p115
aVI talked about the ground realities,
p116
aVand I talked about the frustrations of living in India.
p117
aVIn a few hours, the blog was shared widely,
p118
aVand comments and thoughts poured in
p119
aVfrom across the world.
p120
aVIn that moment, a few things occurred to me.
p121
aVOne, technology was always at hand
p122
aVfor many young women like me.
p123
aVTwo, like me, most young women
p124
aVhardly use it to express their views.
p125
aVThree, I realized for the first time
p126
aVthat my voice mattered.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo in the months that followed,
p129
aVI covered a trail of events in Bangalore
p130
aVwhich had no space in the mainstream news.
p131
aVIn Cubbon Park, which is a big park in Bangalore,
p132
aVI gathered with over 100 others
p133
aVwhen groups of young men came forward
p134
aVto wear skirts to prove that clothing
p135
aVdoes not invite rape.
p136
aVWhen I reported about these events,
p137
aVI felt I had charge, I felt like I had a channel
p138
aVto release all the emotions I had inside me.
p139
aVI attended the town hall march
p140
aVwhen students held up signs saying
p141
aV"Kill them, hang them."
p142
aV"You wouldn't do this to your mothers or sisters."
p143
aVI went to a candlelight vigil
p144
aVwhere citizens gathered together
p145
aVto talk about the issue of sexual violence openly,
p146
aVand I recorded a lot of blogs
p147
aVin response to how worrying the situation was
p148
aVin India at that point.
p149
aV["I am born with sisters and cousin who now live in cities and abroad but they never talk to me or complain about their daily difficulties like you say"]
p150
aa(lp151
VNow, the reactions confused me.
p152
aVWhile supportive comments poured in from across the world,
p153
aVas did vicious ones.
p154
aVSo some called me a hypocrite.
p155
aVSome called me a victim, a rape apologist.
p156
aVSome even said I had a political motive.
p157
aVBut this one comment kind of describes
p158
aVwhat we are discussing here today.
p159
aa(lp160
VBut I was soon to learn that this was not all.
p161
aVAs empowered as I felt
p162
aVwith the new liberty that this
p163
aVcitizen journalism channel gave me,
p164
aVI found myself in an unfamiliar situation.
p165
aVSo sometime last August, I logged onto Facebook
p166
aVand I was looking through my news feed,
p167
aVand I noticed there was a link
p168
aVthat was being shared by my friends.
p169
aVI clicked on the link; it led me back
p170
aVto a report uploaded by an American girl
p171
aVcalled Michaela Cross.
p172
aVThe report was titled,
p173
aV"India: The story you never wanted to hear."
p174
aVAnd in this report, she recounted her firsthand
p175
aVaccount of facing sexual harassment in India.
p176
aVShe wrote, "There is no way to prepare for the eyes,
p177
aVthe eyes that every day stared
p178
aVwith such entitlement at my body,
p179
aVwith no change of expression
p180
aVwhether I met their gaze or not.
p181
aVWalking to the fruit seller's or the tailor's,
p182
aVI got stares so sharp
p183
aVthat they sliced away bits of me piece by piece."
p184
aVShe called India a traveler's heaven and a woman's hell.
p185
aVShe said she was stalked, groped,
p186
aVand masturbated at.
p187
aa(lp188
VNow, late that evening, the report went viral.
p189
aVIt was on news channels across the world.
p190
aVEveryone was discussing it.
p191
aVIt had over a million views,
p192
aVa thousand comments and shares,
p193
aVand I found myself witnessing
p194
aVa very similar thing.
p195
aVThe media was caught in this vicious cycle
p196
aVof opinion and outburst
p197
aVand no outcome whatsoever.
p198
aVSo that night, as I sat wondering
p199
aVhow I should respond,
p200
aVI found myself filled with doubt.
p201
aVYou see, as a writer, I approached this issue
p202
aVas an observer,
p203
aVas an Indian, I felt embarrassment and disbelief,
p204
aVand as an activist, I looked at it as a defender of rights,
p205
aVbut as a citizen journalist,
p206
aVI suddenly felt very vulnerable.
p207
aVI mean, here she was, a young woman
p208
aVwho was using a channel to talk about
p209
aVher experience just as I was,
p210
aVand yet I felt unsettled.
p211
aVYou see, no one ever tells you
p212
aVthat true empowerment comes from giving yourself
p213
aVthe permission to think and act.
p214
aVEmpowerment is often made to sound as if
p215
aVit's an ideal, it's a wonderful outcome.
p216
aVWhen we talk about empowerment, we often
p217
aVtalk about giving people access to materials,
p218
aVgiving them access to tools.
p219
aVBut the thing is, empowerment is an emotion.
p220
aVIt's a feeling.
p221
aVThe first step to empowerment
p222
aVis to give yourself the authority,
p223
aVthe key to independent will,
p224
aVand for women everywhere,
p225
aVno matter who we are or where we come from,
p226
aVthat is the most difficult step.
p227
aVWe fear the sound of our own voice,
p228
aVfor it means admission, but it is this that gives us
p229
aVthe power to change our environment.
p230
aVNow in this situation where I was faced
p231
aVwith so many different kinds of realities,
p232
aVI was unsure how to judge,
p233
aVbecause I didn't know what it would mean for me.
p234
aVI feared to judge because I didn't know what it would be
p235
aVif I didn't support the same view as this girl.
p236
aVI didn't know what it would mean for me
p237
aVif I was challenging someone else's truth.
p238
aVBut yet, it was simple.
p239
aVI had to make a decision:
p240
aVShould I speak up or should I stay quiet?
p241
aVSo after a lot of thought,
p242
aVI recorded a video blog in response,
p243
aVand I told Michaela, well,
p244
aVthere are different sides to India,
p245
aVand I also tried to explain
p246
aVthat things would be okay
p247
aVand I expressed my regret for what she had faced.
p248
aVAnd a few days later, I was invited to talk
p249
aVon air with her,
p250
aVand for the first time, I reached out to this girl
p251
aVwho I had never met, who was so far away,
p252
aVbut yet I felt so close to.
p253
aa(lp254
VSince this report came to light,
p255
aVmore young people than ever
p256
aVwere discussing sexual harassment on the campus,
p257
aVand the university that Michaela belonged to
p258
aVgave her the assistance she needed.
p259
aVThe university even took measures
p260
aVto train its students to equip them
p261
aVwith the skills that they need
p262
aVto confront challenges such as harassment,
p263
aVand for the first the time, I felt I wasn't alone.
p264
aVYou see, if there's anything that I've learned
p265
aVas an active citizen journalist
p266
aVover the past few years,
p267
aVit is our dire lack as a society to actively find
p268
aVavenues where our voices can be heard.
p269
aVWe don't realize that when we are standing up,
p270
aVwe are not just standing up as individuals,
p271
aVwe are standing up for our communities,
p272
aVour friends, our peers.
p273
aVMost of us say that women are denied their rights,
p274
aVbut the truth is, oftentimes,
p275
aVwomen deny themselves these rights.
p276
aVIn a recent survey in India,
p277
aV95 percent of the women who work in I.T.,
p278
aVaviation, hospitality and call centers,
p279
aVsaid they didn't feel safe returning home alone
p280
aVafter work in the late hours or in the evening.
p281
aVIn Bangalore, where I come from,
p282
aVthis number is 85 percent.
p283
aVIn rural areas in India,
p284
aVif anything is to go by the recent
p285
aVgang rapes in Badaun and acid attacks in Odisha
p286
aVand Aligarh are supposed to go by,
p287
aVwe need to act really soon.
p288
aa(lp289
VDon't get me wrong,
p290
aVthe challenges that women will face
p291
aVin telling their stories is real,
p292
aVbut we need to start pursuing
p293
aVand trying to identify mediums
p294
aVto participate in our system
p295
aVand not just pursue the media blindly.
p296
aVToday, more women than ever
p297
aVare standing up and questioning
p298
aVthe government in India,
p299
aVand this is a result of that courage.
p300
aVThere is a sixfold increase in women
p301
aVreporting harassment,
p302
aVand the government passed
p303
aVthe Criminal Law (Amendment) Act in 2013
p304
aVto protect women against sexual assault.
p305
aa(lp306
VAs I end this talk,
p307
aVI just want to say
p308
aVthat I know a lot of us in this room have our secrets,
p309
aVbut let us speak up.
p310
aVLet us fight the shame and talk about it.
p311
aVIt could be a platform, a community,
p312
aVyour loved one, whoever or whatever you choose,
p313
aVbut let us speak up.
p314
aVThe truth is, the end to this problem
p315
aVbegins with us.
p316
aa(lp317
VThank you.

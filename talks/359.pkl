VAside from keeping the rain out and producing some usable space,
p5
aVarchitecture is nothing but a special-effects machine
p6
aVthat delights and disturbs the senses.
p7
aa(lp8
VOur work is across media. The work comes in all shapes and sizes.
p9
aVIt's small and large. This is an ashtray, a water glass.
p10
aVFrom urban planning and master planning
p11
aVto theater and all sorts of stuff.
p12
aVThe thing that all the work has in common
p13
aVis that it challenges the assumptions about conventions of space.
p14
aVAnd these are everyday conventions,
p15
aVconventions that are so obvious that we are blinded by their familiarity.
p16
aVAnd I've assembled a sampling of work
p17
aVthat all share a kind of productive nihilism
p18
aVthat's used in the service of creating a particular special effect.
p19
aVAnd that is something like nothing, or something next to nothing.
p20
aVIt's done through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference
p21
aVin a world that we naturally sleepwalk through.
p22
aa(lp23
VThis is an image that won us a competition
p24
aVfor an exhibition pavilion for the Swiss Expo 2002
p25
aVon Lake Neuchatel, near Geneva.
p26
aVAnd we wanted to use the water not only as a context,
p27
aVbut as a primary building material.
p28
aVWe wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere.
p29
aVSo, no walls, no roof, no purpose \u2014
p30
aVjust a mass of atomized water, a big cloud.
p31
aVAnd this proposal was a reaction to the over-saturation
p32
aVof emergent technologies in recent national and world expositions,
p33
aVwhich feeds, or has been feeding, our insatiable appetite
p34
aVfor visual stimulation with an ever greater digital virtuosity.
p35
aVHigh definition, in our opinion, has become the new orthodoxy.
p36
aVAnd we ask the question, can we use technology, high technology,
p37
aVto make an expo pavilion that's decidedly low definition,
p38
aVthat also challenges the conventions of space and skin,
p39
aVand rethinks our dependence on vision?
p40
aa(lp41
VSo this is how we sought to do it.
p42
aVWater's pumped from the lake and is filtered
p43
aVand shot as a fine mist through an array of high-pressure fog nozzles,
p44
aV35,000 of them. And a weather station is on the structure.
p45
aVIt reads the shifting conditions of temperature, humidity,
p46
aVwind direction, wind speed, dew point,
p47
aVand it processes this data in a central computer
p48
aVthat calibrates the degree of water pressure
p49
aVand distribution of water throughout.
p50
aVAnd it's a responsive system that's trained on actual weather.
p51
aVSo, this is just in construction, and there's a tensegrity structure.
p52
aVIt's about 300 feet wide, the size of a football field,
p53
aVand it sits on just four very delicate columns.
p54
aVThese are the fog nozzles, the interface,
p55
aVand basically the system is kind of reading the real weather,
p56
aVand producing kind of semi-artificial and real weather.
p57
aVSo, we're very interested in creating weather. I don't know why.
p58
aa(lp59
VNow, here we go, one side, the outside
p60
aVand then from the inside of the space
p61
aVyou can see what the quality of the space was.
p62
aVUnlike entering any normal space,
p63
aVentering Blur is like stepping into a habitable medium.
p64
aVIt's formless, featureless, depthless, scaleless, massless,
p65
aVpurposeless and dimensionless.
p66
aVAll references are erased,
p67
aVleaving only an optical whiteout and white noise of the pulsing nozzles.
p68
aVSo, this is an exhibition pavilion
p69
aVwhere there is absolutely nothing to see and nothing to do.
p70
aVAnd we pride ourselves \u2014 it's a spectacular anti-spectacle
p71
aVin which all the conventions of spectacle are turned on their head.
p72
aVSo, the audience is dispersed,
p73
aVfocused attention and dramatic build-up and climax
p74
aVare all replaced by a kind of attenuated attention
p75
aVthat's sustained by a sense of apprehension caused by the fog.
p76
aVAnd this is very much like how the Victorian novel used fog in this way.
p77
aVSo here the world is put out of focus,
p78
aVwhile our visual dependence is put into focus.
p79
aVThe public, you know, once disoriented
p80
aVcan actually ascend to the angel deck above
p81
aVand then just come down under those lips into the water bar.
p82
aVSo, all the waters of the world are served there,
p83
aVso we thought that, you know, after being at the water
p84
aVand moving through the water and breathing the water,
p85
aVyou could also drink this building.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd so it is sort of a theme,
p88
aVbut it goes a little bit, you know, deeper than that.
p89
aVWe really wanted to bring out
p90
aVour absolute dependence on this master sense,
p91
aVand maybe share our kind of sensibility with our other senses.
p92
aVYou know, when we did this project it was a kind of tough sell,
p93
aVbecause the Swiss said, "Well, why are we going to spend, you know,
p94
aV10 million dollars producing an effect
p95
aVthat we already have in natural abundance that we hate?"
p96
aVAnd, you know, we thought \u2014 well, we tried to convince them.
p97
aVAnd in the end, you know, they adapted this as a national icon
p98
aVthat came to represent Swiss doubt, which we \u2014 you know,
p99
aVit was kind of a meaning machine
p100
aVthat everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of.
p101
aVAnyway, it's a temporary structure that was ultimately destroyed,
p102
aVand so it's now a memory of an apparition, actually,
p103
aVbut it continues to live in edible form.
p104
aVAnd this is the highest honor
p105
aVto be bestowed upon an architect in Switzerland \u2014 to have a chocolate bar.
p106
aa(lp107
VAnyway, moving along.
p108
aVSo in the '80s and '90s, we were mostly known for independent work,
p109
aVsuch as installation artist, architect,
p110
aVcommissioned projects by museums and non-for-profit organizations.
p111
aVAnd we did a lot of media work,
p112
aValso a lot of experimental theater projects.
p113
aVIn 2003, the Whitney mounted a retrospective of our work
p114
aVthat featured a lot of this work from the '80s and '90s.
p115
aVHowever, the work itself resisted the very nature of a retrospective,
p116
aVand this is just some of the stuff that was in the show.
p117
aVThis was a piece on tourism in the United States.
p118
aVThis is "Soft Sell" for 42nd Street.
p119
aVThis was something done at the Cartier Foundation.
p120
aV"Master/Slave" at the MOMA, the project series, a piece called "Parasite."
p121
aVAnd so there were many, many of these kinds of projects.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnyway, they gave us the whole fourth floor, and, you know,
p124
aVthe problem of the retrospective
p125
aVwas something we were very uncomfortable with.
p126
aVIt's a kind of invention of the museum
p127
aVthat's supposed to bring a kind of cohesive understanding
p128
aVto the public of a body of work.
p129
aVAnd our work doesn't really resolve itself into a body in any way at all.
p130
aVAnd one of the recurring themes, by the way, that in the work
p131
aVwas a kind of hostility toward the museum itself,
p132
aVand asking about the conventions of the museum, like the wall, the white wall.
p133
aVSo, what you see here
p134
aVis basically a plan of many installations that were put there.
p135
aVAnd we actually had to install white walls
p136
aVto separate these pieces, which didn't belong together.
p137
aVBut these white walls became a kind of target and weapon at the same time.
p138
aVWe used the wall to partition the 13 installations of the project
p139
aVand produce a kind of acoustic and visual separation.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd what you see is \u2014 actually,
p142
aVthe red dotted line shows the track of this performing element,
p143
aVwhich was a new piece that created \u2014 that we created for the \u2014
p144
aVwhich was a robotic drill, basically, that went all the way around,
p145
aVcruised the museum, went all around the walls and did a lot of damage.
p146
aVSo, the drill was mounted on this robotic arm.
p147
aVWe worked with, by the way, Honeybee Robotics. This is the brain.
p148
aVHoneybee Robotics designed the Mars Driller,
p149
aVand it was really very much fun to work with them.
p150
aVThey weren't doing their primary work, which was for the government,
p151
aVwhile they were helping us with this.
p152
aVIn any case, the way it works is that
p153
aVan intelligent navigator basically maps the entire surface of these walls.
p154
aVSo, unfolded it's about 300 linear feet.
p155
aVAnd it randomly generates points within a three-dimensional matrix.
p156
aVIt selects a point, it guides the drill to that point, it pierces the dry wall,
p157
aVleaving a half-inch hole before traveling to the next location.
p158
aVInitially these holes were lone blemishes,
p159
aVand as the exhibition continued
p160
aVthe walls became increasingly perforated.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo eventually holes on both sides of the wall aligned,
p163
aVopening views from gallery to gallery.
p164
aVClusters of holes randomly opened up sections of wall.
p165
aVAnd so this was a three-month performance piece
p166
aVin which the wall was made into kind of an increasingly unstable element.
p167
aVAnd also the acoustic separation was destroyed.
p168
aVAlso the visual separation.
p169
aVAnd there was also this constant background groan, which was very annoying.
p170
aVAnd this is one of the blackout spaces
p171
aVwhere there's a video piece that became totally not useful.
p172
aVSo rather than securing a neutral background for the artworks on display,
p173
aVthe wall now actively competed for attention.
p174
aVAnd this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance
p175
aVbasically exposed the discomfort of the work
p176
aVto this encompassing nature of the retrospective.
p177
aVIt was really great when it started to break up all of the curatorial text.
p178
aa(lp179
VMoving along to a project that we finished about a year ago.
p180
aVIt's the ICA \u2014 the Institute of Contemporary Art \u2014 in Boston,
p181
aVwhich is on the waterfront.
p182
aVAnd there's not enough time to really introduce the building,
p183
aVbut I'll simply say that the building negotiates
p184
aVbetween this outwardly focused nature of the site \u2014
p185
aVyou know, it's a really great waterfront site in Boston \u2014
p186
aVand this contradictory other desire to have an inwardly focused museum.
p187
aVSo, the nature of the building is that it looks at looking \u2014
p188
aVI mean that's its primary objective,
p189
aVboth its program and its architectural conceit.
p190
aVThe building incorporates the site,
p191
aVbut it dispenses it in very small doses
p192
aVin the way that the museum is choreographed.
p193
aVSo, you come in and you're basically squeezed by the theater,
p194
aVby the belly of the theater, into this very compressed space
p195
aVwhere the view is turned off.
p196
aVThen you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall.
p197
aVThis elevator's about the size of a New York City studio apartment.
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd then, this is a view going up,
p200
aVand then you could come into the theater,
p201
aVwhich can actually deny the view or open it up and become a backdrop.
p202
aVAnd many musicians choose to use the theater glass walls totally open.
p203
aVThe view is denied in the galleries
p204
aVwhere we receive just natural light,
p205
aVand then exposed again in the north gallery with a panoramic view.
p206
aVThe original intention of this space,
p207
aVwhich was unfortunately never realized,
p208
aVwas to use lenticular glass
p209
aVwhich allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out.
p210
aVIn this very narrow space that connects east and west galleries
p211
aVthe intention was really to not get a climax,
p212
aVbut to have the view stalk you,
p213
aVso the view would open up as you walked from one end to the other.
p214
aVThis was eliminated because the view was too good,
p215
aVand the mayor said, "No, we just want this open."
p216
aVThe architect lost here.
p217
aa(lp218
VBut culminating \u2014 and that's where this hooks into the theme of my little talk \u2014
p219
aVis this Mediatheque,
p220
aVwhich is suspended from the cantilevered portion of the building.
p221
aVSo this is an 80-foot cantilever \u2014 it's quite substantial.
p222
aVSo, it's already sticking out into space enough,
p223
aVand then from that is this, is this small area called the Mediatheque.
p224
aVThe Mediatheque has something like 16 stations
p225
aVwhere the public can get onto the server
p226
aVand look at digital artworks or also curated artworks off the web.
p227
aVAnd this was really a kind of very important part of this building,
p228
aVand here is a point where architecture \u2014
p229
aVthis is like technology-free \u2014 architecture is only a framing device,
p230
aVit only edits the harbor view, the industrial harbor
p231
aVjust through its walls, its floors and its ceiling,
p232
aVto only expose the water itself, the texture of water,
p233
aVmuch like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow
p234
aVor a lava lamp or something like that.
p235
aVAnd here is where we really felt that there was a great convergence
p236
aVof the technological and the natural in the project.
p237
aVBut there is just no information, it's just \u2014 it's just hypnosis.
p238
aa(lp239
VMoving along to Lincoln Center.
p240
aVThese are the guys that did the project in the first place, 50 years ago.
p241
aVWe're taking over now, doing work that ranges in scale
p242
aVfrom small-scale repairs to major renovations and major facility expansions.
p243
aVBut we're doing it with a lot less testosterone.
p244
aVThis is the extent of the work that's to be completed by 2010.
p245
aVAnd for the purposes of this talk,
p246
aVI wanted to isolate just a part of a project that's even a part of a project
p247
aVthat touches a little bit on this theme of architectural special effects,
p248
aVand it happens to be our current obsession,
p249
aVand it plays a little bit with the purging and adding of distraction.
p250
aVIt's Alice Tully Hall, and it's tucked under the Juilliard Building
p251
aVand descends several levels under the street.
p252
aVSo, this is the entrance to Tully Hall as it used to be,
p253
aVbefore the renovation, which we just started.
p254
aVAnd we asked ourselves, why couldn't it be exhibitionistic,
p255
aVlike the Met, or like some of the other buildings at Lincoln Center?
p256
aVAnd one of the things that we were asked to do
p257
aVwas give it a street identity, expand the lobbies and make it visually accessible.
p258
aVAnd this building, which is just naturally hermetic, we stripped.
p259
aVWe basically did a striptease, architectural striptease,
p260
aVwhere we're framing with this kind of canopy \u2014
p261
aVthe underside of three levels of expansion of Juilliard,
p262
aVabout 45,000 square feet \u2014 cutting it to the angle of Broadway,
p263
aVand then exposing, using that canopy to frame Tully Hall.
p264
aVBefore and after shot. (Applause)
p265
aVWait a minute, it's just in that state, we have a long way to go.
p266
aa(lp267
VBut what I wanted to do was take a couple of seconds that I have left
p268
aVto just talk about the hall itself,
p269
aVwhich is kind of where we're really doing a massive amount of work.
p270
aVSo, the hall is a multi-purpose hall.
p271
aVThe clients have asked us to produce a great chamber music hall.
p272
aVNow, that's really tough to do with a hall that has 1,100 seats.
p273
aVChamber and the notion of chamber has to do with salons
p274
aVand small-scale performances. They asked us to bring an intimacy.
p275
aVHow do you bring an intimacy into a hall?
p276
aVIntimacy for us means a lot of different things.
p277
aVIt means acoustic intimacy and it means visual intimacy.
p278
aa(lp279
VOne thing is that the subway is running and rumbling right under the hall.
p280
aVAnother thing that could be fixed is the shape of the hall.
p281
aVIt's like a coffin, it basically sends all the sound,
p282
aVlike a gutter-ball effect, down the aisles.
p283
aVThe walls are made of absorptive surface,
p284
aVhalf absorptive, half reflective,
p285
aVwhich is not very good for concert sound.
p286
aa(lp287
VThis is Avery Fisher Hall, but the notion of junk \u2014 visual junk \u2014
p288
aVwas very, very important to us, to get rid of visual noise.
p289
aVBecause we can't eliminate a single seat,
p290
aVthe architecture is restricted to 18 inches.
p291
aVSo it's a very, very thin architecture.
p292
aVFirst we do a kind of partial box and box separation,
p293
aVto take away the distraction of the subway noise.
p294
aVNext we wrap the entire hall \u2014 almost like this Olivetti keyboard \u2014
p295
aVwith a material, with a wood material
p296
aVthat basically covers all the surfaces:
p297
aVwall, ceiling, floor, stage, steps, everything, boxes.
p298
aVBut it's acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house
p299
aVand back to the stage. And here's an acoustic shelf.
p300
aVLooking up the hall. Just a section of the stage.
p301
aVJust everything is lined, it incorporates \u2014
p302
aVevery single thing that you could possibly imagine
p303
aVis tucked into this high-performance skin.
p304
aVBut one more added feature.
p305
aa(lp306
VSo now that we've stripped the hall of all visual distraction,
p307
aVeverything that prevents this intimacy
p308
aVwhich is supposed to connect the house, the audience,
p309
aVwith the performers, we add one little detail,
p310
aVone piece of architectural excess, a special effect: lighting.
p311
aVWe very strongly believe that the theatrics of a concert hall
p312
aVis as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival
p313
aVas it is when the concert starts.
p314
aVSo what we wanted to do was produce this effect,
p315
aVthis lighting effect,
p316
aVwhich made us have to bioengineer the wood walls.
p317
aVAnd what it entails is the use of resin, of this very thick resin
p318
aVwith a veneer of the same kind of wood that's used throughout the hall,
p319
aVin a kind of seamless continuity
p320
aVthat wraps the hall in light, like a belt of light: rather than separating,
p321
aVlike a proscenium would separate the audience from performers,
p322
aVit connects audience with players.
p323
aa(lp324
VAnd this is a mockup that is in Salt Lake City
p325
aVthat gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full-scale.
p326
aVAnd this is a guy from Salt Lake City,
p327
aVthis is what they look like out there.
p328
aV(Laughter)
p329
aVAnd for us, I mean it's really kind of a very strange thing,
p330
aVbut the moments in the hall that the buzz kind of dies down
p331
aVwhen the audience is waiting for the performance to begin,
p332
aVvery similar to the parting of curtains or the raising of a chandelier,
p333
aVthe walls will just exude this glow, temporarily stealing attention from the stage.
p334
aVAnd this is Tully in construction now.
p335
aa(lp336
VI have no ending to say, except that I'm a couple of minutes over.
p337
aa(lp338
VThank you very much.

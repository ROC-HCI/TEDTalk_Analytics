VI have had the distinct pleasure
p5
aVof living inside two biospheres.
p6
aVOf course we all here in this room live in Biosphere 1.
p7
aVI've also lived in Biosphere 2.
p8
aVAnd the wonderful thing about that is that I get to compare biospheres.
p9
aVAnd hopefully from that I get to learn something.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo what did I learn? Well,
p12
aVhere I am inside Biosphere 2, making a pizza.
p13
aVSo I am harvesting the wheat, in order to make the dough.
p14
aVAnd then of course I have to milk the goats
p15
aVand feed the goats in order to make the cheese.
p16
aVIt took me four months in Biosphere 2 to make a pizza.
p17
aVHere in Biosphere 1, well it takes me about two minutes,
p18
aVbecause I pick up the phone and I call and say,
p19
aV"Hey, can you deliver the pizza?"
p20
aa(lp21
VSo Biosphere 2
p22
aVwas essentially a three-acre,
p23
aVentirely sealed, miniature world
p24
aVthat I lived in for two years and 20 minutes.
p25
aV(Laughter)
p26
aVOver the top it was sealed with steel and glass,
p27
aVunderneath it was sealed with a pan of steel \u2014
p28
aVessentially entirely sealed.
p29
aVSo we had our own miniature rainforest,
p30
aVa private beach with a coral reef.
p31
aVWe had a savanna, a marsh, a desert.
p32
aVWe had our own half-acre farm that we had to grow everything.
p33
aVAnd of course we had our human habitat, where we lived.
p34
aa(lp35
VBack in the mid-'80s when we were designing Biosphere 2,
p36
aVwe had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions.
p37
aVI mean, what is a biosphere?
p38
aVBack then, yes, I guess we all know now
p39
aVthat it is essentially the sphere of life around the Earth, right?
p40
aVWell, you have to get a little more specific than that if you're going to build one.
p41
aVAnd so we decided that what it really is
p42
aVis that it is entirely materially closed \u2014
p43
aVthat is, nothing goes in or out at all, no material \u2014
p44
aVand energetically open,
p45
aVwhich is essentially what planet Earth is.
p46
aa(lp47
VThis is a chamber that was 1/400th the size of Biosphere 2
p48
aVthat we called our Test Module.
p49
aVAnd the very first day that this fellow, John Allen,
p50
aVwalked in, to spend a couple of days in there
p51
aVwith all the plants and animals and bacteria that we'd put in there
p52
aVto hopefully keep him alive,
p53
aVthe doctors were incredibly concerned
p54
aVthat he was going to succumb to some dreadful toxin,
p55
aVor that his lungs were going to get choked with bacteria or something, fungus.
p56
aVBut of course none of that happened.
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd over the ensuing few years,
p59
aVthere were great sagas about designing Biosphere 2.
p60
aVBut by 1991
p61
aVwe finally had this thing built.
p62
aVAnd it was time for us to go in
p63
aVand give it a go.
p64
aVWe needed to know,
p65
aVis life this malleable?
p66
aVCan you take this biosphere,
p67
aVthat has evolved on a planetary scale,
p68
aVand jam it into a little bottle,
p69
aVand will it survive?
p70
aVBig questions.
p71
aVAnd we wanted to know this both for being able to go somewhere else
p72
aVin the universe \u2014 if we were going to go to Mars, for instance,
p73
aVwould we take a biosphere with us, to live in it?
p74
aVWe also wanted to know so we can understand more about
p75
aVthe Earth that we all live in.
p76
aVWell, in 1991 it was finally time for us to go in
p77
aVand try out this baby.
p78
aVLet's take it on a maiden voyage.
p79
aVWill it work? Or will something happen
p80
aVthat we can't understand and we can't fix,
p81
aVthereby negating the concept of man-made biospheres?
p82
aa(lp83
VSo eight of us went in: four men and four women.
p84
aVMore on that later.
p85
aV(Laughter)
p86
aVAnd this is the world that we lived in.
p87
aVSo, on the top, we had
p88
aVthese beautiful rainforests and an ocean,
p89
aVand underneath we had all this technosphere, we called it,
p90
aVwhich is where all the pumps and the valves
p91
aVand the water tanks and the air handlers, and all of that.
p92
aVOne of the Biospherians called it "garden of Eden
p93
aVon top of an aircraft carrier."
p94
aVAnd then also we had the human habitat of course,
p95
aVwith the laboratories, and all of that.
p96
aVThis is the agriculture.
p97
aVIt was essentially an organic farm.
p98
aa(lp99
VThe day I walked into Biosphere 2,
p100
aVI was, for the first time,
p101
aVbreathing a completely different atmosphere
p102
aVthan everybody else in the world,
p103
aVexcept seven other people.
p104
aVAt that moment I became part of that biosphere.
p105
aVAnd I don't mean that in an abstract sense;
p106
aVI mean it rather literally.
p107
aVWhen I breathed out, my CO2
p108
aVfed the sweet potatoes that I was growing.
p109
aVAnd we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes.
p110
aV(Laughter)
p111
aVAnd those sweet potatoes
p112
aVbecame part of me.
p113
aVIn fact, we ate so many sweet potatoes
p114
aVI became orange with sweet potato.
p115
aVI literally was eating the same carbon over and over again.
p116
aVI was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way.
p117
aa(lp118
VWhen it came to our atmosphere, however,
p119
aVit wasn't that much of a joke over the long term,
p120
aVbecause it turned out that we were losing oxygen, quite a lot of oxygen.
p121
aVAnd we knew that we were losing CO2.
p122
aVAnd so we were working to sequester carbon.
p123
aVGood lord \u2014 we know that term now.
p124
aVWe were growing plants like crazy.
p125
aVWe were taking their biomass, storing them in the basement,
p126
aVgrowing plants, going around, around, around,
p127
aVtrying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere.
p128
aVWe were trying to stop carbon from going into the atmosphere.
p129
aVWe stopped irrigating our soil, as much as we could.
p130
aVWe stopped tilling, so that we could prevent greenhouse gasses from going into the air.
p131
aVBut our oxygen was going down faster
p132
aVthan our CO2 was going up, which was quite unexpected,
p133
aVbecause we had seen them going in tandem in the test module.
p134
aVAnd it was like playing atomic hide-and-seek.
p135
aVWe had lost seven tons of oxygen.
p136
aVAnd we had no clue where it was.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd I tell you, when you lose a lot of oxygen \u2014
p139
aVand our oxygen went down quite far;
p140
aVit went from 21 percent down to 14.2 percent \u2014
p141
aVmy goodness, do you feel dreadful.
p142
aVI mean we were dragging ourselves around the Biosphere.
p143
aVAnd we had sleep apnea at night.
p144
aVSo you'd wake up gasping with breath,
p145
aVbecause your blood chemistry has changed.
p146
aVAnd that you literally do that. You stop breathing and then you \u2014 (Gasps) \u2014
p147
aVtake a breath and it wakes you up. And it's very irritating.
p148
aVAnd everybody outside thought we were dying.
p149
aVI mean, the media was making it sound like were were dying.
p150
aVAnd I had to call up my mother every other day saying, "No, Mum, it's fine, fine.
p151
aVWe're not dead. We're fine. We're fine."
p152
aVAnd the doctor was, in fact, checking us
p153
aVto make sure we were, in fact, fine.
p154
aVBut in fact he was the person who was most susceptible to the oxygen.
p155
aVAnd one day he couldn't add up a line of figures.
p156
aVAnd it was time for us to put oxygen in.
p157
aVAnd you might think, well,
p158
aV"Boy, your life support system
p159
aVwas failing you. Wasn't that dreadful?"
p160
aVYes. In a sense it was terrifying.
p161
aVExcept that I knew I could walk out the airlock door
p162
aVat any time, if it really got bad,
p163
aVthough who was going to say, "I can't take it anymore!"?
p164
aVNot me, that was for sure.
p165
aa(lp166
VBut on the other hand, it was the scientific gold of the project,
p167
aVbecause we could really crank this baby up,
p168
aVas a scientific tool,
p169
aVand see if we could, in fact, find
p170
aVwhere those seven tons of oxygen had gone.
p171
aVAnd we did indeed find it.
p172
aVAnd we found it in the concrete.
p173
aVEssentially it had done something very simple.
p174
aVWe had put too much carbon in the soil in the form of compost.
p175
aVIt broke down; it took oxygen out of the air;
p176
aVit put CO2 into the air; and it went into the concrete.
p177
aVPretty straightforward really.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo at the end of the two years
p180
aVwhen we came out, we were elated,
p181
aVbecause, in fact, although you might say
p182
aVwe had discovered something that was quite "uhh,"
p183
aVwhen your oxygen is going down,
p184
aVstopped working, essentially, in your life support system,
p185
aVthat's a very bad failure.
p186
aVExcept that we knew what it was. And we knew how to fix it.
p187
aVAnd nothing else emerged
p188
aVthat really was as serious as that.
p189
aVAnd we proved the concept, more or less.
p190
aVPeople, on the other hand, was a different subject.
p191
aVWe were \u2014 yeah I don't know that we were fixable.
p192
aVWe all went quite nuts, I will say.
p193
aa(lp194
VAnd the day I came out of Biosphere 2,
p195
aVI was thrilled I was going to see all my family and my friends.
p196
aVFor two years I'd been seeing people through the glass.
p197
aVAnd everybody ran up to me.
p198
aVAnd I recoiled. They stank!
p199
aVPeople stink!
p200
aVWe stink of hairspray and underarm deodorant,
p201
aVand all kinds of stuff.
p202
aVNow we had stuff inside Biosphere to keep ourselves clean,
p203
aVbut nothing with perfume.
p204
aVAnd boy do we stink out here.
p205
aVNot only that,
p206
aVbut I lost touch of where my food came from.
p207
aVI had been growing all my own food.
p208
aVI had no idea what was in my food, where it came from.
p209
aVI didn't even recognize half the names in most of the food that I was eating.
p210
aVIn fact, I would stand for hours in the aisles of shops,
p211
aVreading all the names on all of the things.
p212
aVPeople must have thought I was nuts.
p213
aVIt was really quite astonishing.
p214
aVAnd I slowly lost track
p215
aVof where I was in this big biosphere, in this big biosphere that we all live in.
p216
aVIn Biosphere 2 I totally understood
p217
aVthat I had a huge impact on my biosphere, everyday,
p218
aVand it had an impact on me,
p219
aVvery viscerally, very literally.
p220
aa(lp221
VSo I went about my business:
p222
aVParagon Space Development Corporation,
p223
aVa little firm I started with people while I was in the Biosphere,
p224
aVbecause I had nothing else to do.
p225
aVAnd one of the things we did was
p226
aVtry to figure out: how small can you make these biospheres,
p227
aVand what can you do with them?
p228
aVAnd so we sent one onto the Mir Space Station.
p229
aVWe had one on the shuttle and one on the International Space Station,
p230
aVfor 16 months, where we managed to produce
p231
aVthe first organisms to go through
p232
aVcomplete multiple life cycles in space \u2014
p233
aVreally pushing the envelope
p234
aVof understanding how malleable
p235
aVour life systems are.
p236
aa(lp237
VAnd I'm also proud to announce
p238
aVthat you're getting a sneak preview \u2014 on Friday we're going to announce
p239
aVthat we're actually forming a team
p240
aVto develop a system to grow plants on the Moon,
p241
aVwhich is going to be pretty fun.
p242
aVAnd the legacy of that is a system that we were designing:
p243
aVan entirely sealed system to grow plants to grow on Mars.
p244
aVAnd part of that is that we had to model
p245
aVvery rapid circulation of CO2
p246
aVand oxygen and water through this plant system.
p247
aa(lp248
VAs a result of that modeling
p249
aVI ended up in all places,
p250
aVin Eritrea, in the Horn of Africa.
p251
aVEritrea, formerly part of Ethiopia,
p252
aVis one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful,
p253
aVincredibly stark, and I have no understanding
p254
aVof how people eke out a living there.
p255
aVIt is so dry.
p256
aVThis is what I saw.
p257
aVBut this is also what I saw.
p258
aVI saw a company that had
p259
aVtaken seawater
p260
aVand sand, and they were growing
p261
aVa kind of crop that will grow on pure salt water without having to treat it.
p262
aVAnd it will produce a food crop.
p263
aVIn this case it was oilseed.
p264
aVIt was astonishing. They were also producing mangroves
p265
aVin a plantation.
p266
aVAnd the mangroves were providing wood
p267
aVand honey and leaves for the animals,
p268
aVso that they could produce milk and whatnot,
p269
aVlike we had in the Biosphere.
p270
aa(lp271
VAnd all of it was coming from this: shrimp farms.
p272
aVShrimp farms are a scourge on the earth,
p273
aVfrankly, from an environmental point of view.
p274
aVThey pour huge amounts of pollutants into the ocean.
p275
aVThey also pollute their next-door neighbors.
p276
aVSo they're all shitting each other's ponds, quite literally.
p277
aVAnd what this project was doing
p278
aVwas taking the effluent of these,
p279
aVand turning them into all of this food.
p280
aVThey were literally turning pollution into abundance for a desert people.
p281
aVThey had created an industrial ecosystem, of a sense.
p282
aa(lp283
VI was there because I was actually modeling the mangrove portion
p284
aVfor a carbon credit program, under the U.N.
p285
aVKyoto Protocol system.
p286
aVAnd as I was modeling this mangrove swamp,
p287
aVI was thinking to myself, "How do you put a box around this?"
p288
aVWhen I'm modeling a plant in a box, literally,
p289
aVI know where to draw the boundary.
p290
aVIn a mangrove forest like this I have no idea.
p291
aVWell, of course you have to draw the boundary around the whole of the Earth.
p292
aVAnd understand its interactions with the entire Earth.
p293
aVAnd put your project in that context.
p294
aa(lp295
VAround the world today we're seeing an incredible transformation,
p296
aVfrom what I would call a biocidal species,
p297
aVone that \u2014 whether we intentionally or unintentionally \u2014
p298
aVhave designed our systems to kill life, a lot of the time.
p299
aVThis is in fact, this beautiful photograph,
p300
aVis in fact over the Amazon.
p301
aVAnd here the light green are areas of massive deforestation.
p302
aVAnd those beautiful wispy clouds
p303
aVare, in fact, fires, human-made fires.
p304
aVWe're in the process of transforming from this,
p305
aVto what I would call a biophilic society,
p306
aVone where we learn to nurture society.
p307
aVNow it may not seem like it, but we are.
p308
aVIt is happening all across the world,
p309
aVin every kind of walk of life,
p310
aVand every kind of career
p311
aVand industry that you can think of.
p312
aVAnd I think often times people get lost in that.
p313
aVThey go, "But how can I possibly find my way in that?
p314
aVIt's such a huge subject."
p315
aVAnd I would say that the small stuff counts. It really does.
p316
aa(lp317
VThis is the story of a rake in my backyard.
p318
aVThis was my backyard,
p319
aVvery early on, when I bought my property.
p320
aVAnd in Arizona, of course, everybody puts gravel down.
p321
aVAnd they like to keep everything beautifully raked. And they keep all the leaves away.
p322
aVAnd on Sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out,
p323
aVand I want to throttle them.
p324
aVIt's a certain type of aesthetic.
p325
aVWe're very uncomfortable with untidiness.
p326
aVAnd I threw away my rake.
p327
aVAnd I let all of the leaves fall from the trees that I have on my property.
p328
aVAnd over time, essentially what have I been doing?
p329
aVI've been building topsoil.
p330
aVAnd so now all the birds come in. And I have hawks.
p331
aVAnd I have an oasis.
p332
aVThis is what happens every spring. For six weeks,
p333
aVsix to eight weeks, I have this flush of green oasis.
p334
aVThis is actually in a riparian area.
p335
aVAnd all of Tucson could be like this
p336
aVif everybody would just revolt and throw away the rake.
p337
aVThe small stuff counts.
p338
aa(lp339
VThe Industrial Revolution \u2014 and Prometheus \u2014
p340
aVhas given us this, the ability to light up the world.
p341
aVIt has also given us this,
p342
aVthe ability to look at the world from the outside.
p343
aVNow we may not all have
p344
aVanother biosphere that we can run to,
p345
aVand compare it to this biosphere.
p346
aVBut we can look at the world,
p347
aVand try to understand where we are in its context,
p348
aVand how we choose to interact with it.
p349
aa(lp350
VAnd if you lose where you are in your biosphere,
p351
aVor are perhaps having a difficulty connecting
p352
aVwith where you are in the biosphere,
p353
aVI would say to you,
p354
aVtake a deep breath.
p355
aVThe yogis had it right.
p356
aVBreath does, in fact, connect us all
p357
aVin a very literal way.
p358
aVTake a breath now.
p359
aVAnd as you breathe, think
p360
aVabout what is in your breath.
p361
aVThere perhaps is the CO2 from the person sitting next-door to you.
p362
aVMaybe there is a little bit of oxygen
p363
aVfrom some algae on the beach not far from here.
p364
aVIt also connects us in time.
p365
aVThere may be some carbon in your breath
p366
aVfrom the dinosaurs.
p367
aVThere could also be carbon that you are exhaling now
p368
aVthat will be in the breath
p369
aVof your great-great-great-grandchildren.
p370
aVThank you. (Applause)

In 1991, she and seven others were locked in a three-acre, hermetically-sealed environment in the Arizona desert. Nothing was allowed in or out, and everything had to be recycled. Poynter, and the rest of the team, endured dangerously low oxygen levels and constant hunger, but they survived -- something many scientists said was impossible.&nbsp; <br /><br />After leaving Biosphere 2, Poynter went on to found Paragon Space Development Corporation, along with her former fellow biospherian and now husband, Taber MacCallum. Paragon develops technologies that might allow humans to live in extreme environments such as outer space and underwater. As president of Paragon, Poynter has had experiments flown on the International Space Station, Russian Mir Space Station and US Space Shuttle, as well as working on underwater technologies with the US Navy.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, Poynter has not given up on her homeland -- Biosphere 1.

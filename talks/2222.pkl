VTonight, I'm going to try to make the case
p5
aVthat inviting a loved one, a friend or even a stranger
p6
aVto record a meaningful interview with you
p7
aVjust might turn out to be one of the most  important moments in that person's life,
p8
aVand in yours.
p9
aa(lp10
VWhen I was 22 years old, I was lucky enough to find my calling
p11
aVwhen I fell into making radio stories.
p12
aVAt almost the exact same time,
p13
aVI found out that my dad, who I was very, very close to, was gay.
p14
aVI was taken completely by surprise.
p15
aVWe were a very tight-knit family,
p16
aVand I was crushed.
p17
aVAt some point, in one of our strained conversations,
p18
aVmy dad mentioned the Stonewall riots.
p19
aVHe told me that one night in 1969,
p20
aVa group of young black and Latino drag queens
p21
aVfought back against the police at a gay bar in Manhattan
p22
aVcalled the Stonewall Inn,
p23
aVand how this sparked the modern gay rights movement.
p24
aa(lp25
VIt was an amazing story, and it piqued my interest.
p26
aVSo I decided to pick up my tape  recorder and find out more.
p27
aVWith the help of a young archivist named Michael Shirker,
p28
aVwe tracked down all of the people we could find
p29
aVwho had been at the Stonewall Inn that night.
p30
aVRecording these interviews,
p31
aVI saw how the microphone gave me the license
p32
aVto go places I otherwise never would have gone
p33
aVand talk to people I might not otherwise ever have spoken to.
p34
aVI had the privilege of getting to know
p35
aVsome of the most amazing, fierce and courageous human beings
p36
aVI had ever met.
p37
aVIt was the first time the story of Stonewall
p38
aVhad been told to a national audience.
p39
aVI dedicated the program to my dad,
p40
aVit changed my relationship with him, and it changed my life.
p41
aa(lp42
VOver the next 15 years, I made many more radio documentaries,
p43
aVworking to shine a light on people who are rarely heard from in the media.
p44
aVOver and over again,
p45
aVI'd see how this simple act of being interviewed
p46
aVcould mean so much to people,
p47
aVparticularly those who had been told that their stories didn't matter.
p48
aVI could literally see people's back straighten
p49
aVas they started to speak into the microphone.
p50
aa(lp51
VIn 1998, I made a documentary about the last flophouse hotels
p52
aVon the Bowery in Manhattan.
p53
aVGuys stayed up in these cheap hotels for decades.
p54
aVThey lived in cubicles the size of prison cells
p55
aVcovered with chicken wire
p56
aVso you couldn't jump from one room into the next.
p57
aVLater, I wrote a book on the men with the photographer Harvey Wang.
p58
aVI remember walking into a flophouse with an early version of the book
p59
aVand showing one of the guys his page.
p60
aVHe stood there staring at it in silence,
p61
aVthen he grabbed the book out of my hand
p62
aVand started running down the long, narrow hallway
p63
aVholding it over his head
p64
aVshouting, "I exist! I exist."
p65
aV(Applause)
p66
aa(lp67
VIn many ways, "I exist" became the clarion call for StoryCorps,
p68
aVthis crazy idea that I had a dozen years ago.
p69
aVThe thought was to take documentary work
p70
aVand turn it on its head.
p71
aVTraditionally, broadcast documentary
p72
aVhas been about recording interviews to create a work of art or entertainment
p73
aVor education that is seen or heard by a whole lot of people,
p74
aVbut I wanted to try something
p75
aVwhere the interview itself was the purpose of this work,
p76
aVand see if we could give many, many, many people the chance
p77
aVto be listened to in this way.
p78
aVSo in Grand Central Terminal 11 years ago,
p79
aVwe built a booth where anyone  can come to honor someone else
p80
aVby interviewing them about their life.
p81
aVYou come to this booth and you're met by a facilitator who brings you inside.
p82
aVYou sit across from, say, your grandfather
p83
aVfor close to an hour and you listen and you talk.
p84
aVMany people think of it as, if this was to be our last conversation,
p85
aVwhat would I want to ask of and say to this person
p86
aVwho means so much to me?
p87
aVAt the end of the session, you walk away with a copy of the interview
p88
aVand another copy goes to the American Folklife Center
p89
aVat the Library of Congress
p90
aVso that your great-great-great-grandkids can someday get to know your grandfather
p91
aVthrough his voice and story.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo we open this booth in one of the busiest places in the world
p94
aVand invite people to have this incredibly intimate conversation
p95
aVwith another human being.
p96
aVI had no idea if it would work, but from the very beginning, it did.
p97
aVPeople treated the experience with incredible respect,
p98
aVand amazing conversations happened inside.
p99
aa(lp100
VI want to play just one animated excerpt
p101
aVfrom an interview recorded at that original Grand Central Booth.
p102
aVThis is 12-year-old Joshua Littman interviewing his mother, Sarah.
p103
aVJosh has Asperger's syndrome.
p104
aVAs you may know, kids with Asperger's are incredibly smart
p105
aVbut have a tough time socially.
p106
aVThey usually have obsessions.
p107
aVIn Josh's case, it's with animals,
p108
aVso this is Josh talking with his mom Sarah
p109
aVat Grand Central nine years ago.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Video) Josh Littman: From a scale of one to 10,
p112
aVdo you think your life would be different without animals?
p113
aVSarah Littman: I think it would be an eight without animals,
p114
aVbecause they add so much pleasure to life.
p115
aa(lp116
VJL: How else do you think your life would be different without them?
p117
aa(lp118
VSL: I could do without things like cockroaches and snakes.
p119
aa(lp120
VJL: Well, I'm okay with snakes as long as they're not venomous
p121
aVor constrict you or anything.
p122
aa(lp123
VSL: Yeah, I'm not a big snake person \u2014
p124
aa(lp125
VJL: But cockroach is just the insect we love to hate.
p126
aa(lp127
VSL: Yeah, it really is.
p128
aa(lp129
VJL: Have you ever thought you couldn't cope with having a child?
p130
aa(lp131
VSL: I remember when you were a baby, you had really bad colic,
p132
aVso you would just cry and cry.
p133
aa(lp134
VJL: What's colic? SL: It's when you get this stomach ache
p135
aVand all you do is scream for, like, four hours.
p136
aa(lp137
VJL: Even louder than Amy does?
p138
aa(lp139
VSL: You were pretty loud, but Amy's was more high-pitched.
p140
aa(lp141
VJL: I think it feels like everyone seems to like Amy more,
p142
aVlike she's the perfect little angel.
p143
aa(lp144
VSL: Well, I can understand why you think that people like Amy more,
p145
aVand I'm not saying it's because of your Asperger's syndrome,
p146
aVbut being friendly comes easily to Amy,
p147
aVwhereas I think for you it's more difficult,
p148
aVbut the people who take the time to get to know you love you so much.
p149
aa(lp150
VJL: Like Ben or Eric or Carlos? SL: Yeah \u2014
p151
aa(lp152
VJL: Like I have better quality friends but less quantity? (Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VSL: I wouldn't judge the quality, but I think \u2014
p155
aVJL: I mean, first it was like, Amy loved Claudia, then she hated Claudia,
p156
aVshe loved Claudia, then she hated Claudia.
p157
aa(lp158
VSL: Part of that's a girl thing, honey.
p159
aVThe important thing for you is that you have a few very good friends,
p160
aVand really that's what you need in life.
p161
aa(lp162
VJL: Did I turn out to be the son you wanted when I was born?
p163
aVDid I meet your expectations?
p164
aa(lp165
VSL: You've exceeded my expectations, sweetie,
p166
aVbecause, sure, you have these fantasies of what your child's going to be like,
p167
aVbut you have made me grow so much as a parent, because you think \u2014
p168
aa(lp169
VJL: Well, I was the one who made you a parent.
p170
aa(lp171
VSL: You were the one who made me a parent. That's a good point. (Laughter)
p172
aVBut also because you think differently
p173
aVfrom what they tell you in the parenting books,
p174
aVI really had to learn to think outside of the box with you,
p175
aVand it's made me much more creative as a parent and as a person,
p176
aVand I'll always thank you for that.
p177
aa(lp178
VJL: And that helped when Amy was born?
p179
aa(lp180
VSL: And that helped when Amy was born, but you are so incredibly special to me
p181
aVand I'm so lucky to have you as my son.
p182
aV(Applause)
p183
aa(lp184
VDavid Isay: After this story ran on public radio,
p185
aVJosh received hundreds of letters
p186
aVtelling him what an amazing kid he was.
p187
aVHis mom, Sarah, bound them together in a book,
p188
aVand when Josh got picked on at school, they would read the letters together.
p189
aVI just want to acknowledge that two of my heroes
p190
aVare here with us tonight.
p191
aVSarah Littman and her son Josh, who is now an honors student in college.
p192
aV(Applause)
p193
aa(lp194
VYou know, a lot of people talk about crying when they hear StoryCorps stories,
p195
aVand it's not because they're sad.
p196
aVMost of them aren't.
p197
aVI think it's because you're hearing something authentic and pure
p198
aVat this moment, when sometimes it's hard to tell
p199
aVwhat's real and what's an advertisement.
p200
aVIt's kind of the anti-reality TV.
p201
aVNobody comes to StoryCorps to get rich.
p202
aVNobody comes to get famous.
p203
aVIt's simply an act of generosity and love.
p204
aVSo many of these are just everyday people
p205
aVtalking about lives lived with kindness, courage, decency and dignity,
p206
aVand when you hear that kind of story,
p207
aVit can sometimes feel like you're walking on holy ground.
p208
aVSo this experiment  in Grand Central worked,
p209
aa(lp210
Vand we expanded across the country.
p211
aVToday, more than 100,000 people in all 50 states
p212
aVin thousands of cities and towns across America
p213
aVhave recorded StoryCorps interviews.
p214
aVIt's now the largest single collection of human voices ever gathered.
p215
aV(Applause)
p216
aa(lp217
VWe've hired and trained hundreds of facilitators
p218
aVto help guide people through the experience.
p219
aVMost serve a year or two with StoryCorps
p220
aVtraveling the country, gathering the wisdom of humanity.
p221
aVThey call it bearing witness,
p222
aVand if you ask them,
p223
aVall of the facilitators will tell you that the most important thing
p224
aVthey've learned from being present during these interviews
p225
aVis that people are basically good.
p226
aVAnd I think for the first years of StoryCorps, you could argue
p227
aVthat there was some kind of a selection bias happening,
p228
aVbut after tens of thousands of interviews with every kind of person
p229
aVin every part of the country \u2014
p230
aVrich, poor, five years old to 105,
p231
aV80 different languages, across the political spectrum \u2014
p232
aVyou have to think that maybe these guys are actually onto something.
p233
aa(lp234
VI've also learned so much from these interviews.
p235
aVI've learned about the poetry and the wisdom and the grace
p236
aVthat can be found in the words of people all around us
p237
aVwhen we simply take the time to listen,
p238
aVlike this interview
p239
aVbetween a betting clerk in Brooklyn named Danny Perasa
p240
aVwho brought his wife Annie to StoryCorps to talk about his love for her.
p241
aa(lp242
V(Audio) Danny Perasa: You see, the thing of it is,
p243
aVI always feel guilty when I say "I love you" to you.
p244
aVAnd I say it so often. I say it to remind you
p245
aVthat as dumpy as I am, it's coming from me.
p246
aVIt's like hearing a beautiful song from a busted old radio,
p247
aVand it's nice of you to keep the radio around the house.
p248
aa(lp249
VAnnie Perasa: If I don't have a note on the kitchen table,
p250
aVI think there's something wrong.
p251
aVYou write a love letter to me every morning.
p252
aVDP: Well, the only thing that could possibly be wrong
p253
aVis I couldn't find a silly pen.
p254
aa(lp255
VAP: To my princess:
p256
aVThe weather outside today is extremely rainy.
p257
aVI'll call you at 11:20 in the morning.
p258
aa(lp259
VDP: It's a romantic weather report.
p260
aa(lp261
VAP: And I love you. I love you. I love you.
p262
aa(lp263
VDP: When a guy is happily married, no matter what happens at work,
p264
aVno matter what happens in the rest of the day,
p265
aVthere's a shelter when you get home,
p266
aVthere's a knowledge knowing that you can hug somebody
p267
aVwithout them throwing you downstairs and saying, "Get your hands off me."
p268
aVBeing married is like having a color television set.
p269
aVYou never want to go back to black and white.
p270
aV(Laughter)
p271
aa(lp272
VDI: Danny was about five feet tall
p273
aVwith crossed eyes and one single snaggletooth,
p274
aVbut Danny Perasa had more romance in his little pinky
p275
aVthan all of Hollywood's leading men put together.
p276
aa(lp277
VWhat else have I learned?
p278
aVI've learned about the almost unimaginable capacity
p279
aVfor the human spirit to forgive.
p280
aVI've learned about resilience and I've learned about strength.
p281
aa(lp282
VLike an interview with Oshea Israel and Mary Johnson.
p283
aVWhen Oshea was a teenager, he murdered Mary's only son,
p284
aVLaramiun Byrd, in a gang fight.
p285
aVA dozen years later, Mary went to prison
p286
aVto meet Oshea and find out who this person was
p287
aVwho had taken her son's life.
p288
aVSlowly and remarkably, they became friends,
p289
aVand when he was finally released from the penitentiary,
p290
aVOshea actually moved in next door to Mary.
p291
aVThis is just a short excerpt of a conversation they had
p292
aVsoon after Oshea was freed.
p293
aa(lp294
V(Video) Mary Johnson: My natural son is no longer here.
p295
aVI didn't see him graduate, and now you're going to college.
p296
aVI'll have the opportunity to see you graduate.
p297
aVI didn't see him get married.
p298
aVHopefully one day, I'll be able to experience that with you.
p299
aVOshea Israel: Just to hear you say those things and to be
p300
aVin my life in the manner in which you are is my motivation.
p301
aVIt motivates me to make sure that I stay on the right path.
p302
aVYou still believe in me,
p303
aVand the fact that you can do it despite how much pain I caused you,
p304
aVit's amazing.
p305
aa(lp306
VMJ: I know it's not an easy thing to be able to share our story together,
p307
aVeven with us sitting here looking at each other right now.
p308
aVI know it's not an easy thing, so I admire that you can do this.
p309
aa(lp310
VOI: I love you, lady. MJ: I love you too, son.
p311
aV(Applause)
p312
aa(lp313
VDI: And I've been reminded countless times of the courage and goodness of people,
p314
aVand how the arc of history truly does bend towards justice.
p315
aa(lp316
VLike the story of Alexis Martinez, who was born Arthur Martinez
p317
aVin the Harold Ickes projects in Chicago.
p318
aVIn the interview, she talks with her daughter Lesley
p319
aVabout joining a gang as a young man,
p320
aVand later in life transitioning into the woman she was always meant to be.
p321
aVThis is Alexis and her daughter Lesley.
p322
aa(lp323
V(Audio) Alexis Martinez: One of the most difficult things for me was
p324
aVI was always afraid that I wouldn't be allowed
p325
aVto be in my granddaughters' lives,
p326
aVand you blew that completely out of the water,
p327
aVyou and your husband.
p328
aVOne of the fruits of that is, in my relationship with my granddaughters,
p329
aVthey fight with each other sometimes over whether I'm he or she.
p330
aa(lp331
VLesley Martinez: But they're free to talk about it.
p332
aa(lp333
VAM: They're free to talk about it, but that, to me, is a miracle.
p334
aa(lp335
VLM: You don't have to apologize. You don't have to tiptoe.
p336
aVWe're not going to cut you off, and that's something I've always
p337
aVwanted you to just know, that you're loved.
p338
aa(lp339
VAM: You know, I live this every day now.
p340
aVI walk down the streets as a woman, and I really am at peace with who I am.
p341
aVI mean, I wish I had a softer voice maybe,
p342
aVbut now I walk in love and I try to live that way every day.
p343
aa(lp344
VDI: Now I walk in love.
p345
aa(lp346
VI'm going to tell you a secret about StoryCorps.
p347
aVIt takes some courage to have these conversations.
p348
aVStoryCorps speaks to our mortality.
p349
aVParticipants know this recording will be heard long after they're gone.
p350
aVThere's a hospice doctor named Ira Byock
p351
aVwho has worked closely with us on recording interviews
p352
aVwith people who are dying.
p353
aVHe wrote a book called "The Four Things That Matter Most"
p354
aVabout the four things you want to say to the most important people in your life
p355
aVbefore they or you die:
p356
aVthank you, I love you,
p357
aVforgive me, I forgive you.
p358
aVThey're just about the most powerful words we can say to one another,
p359
aVand often that's what happens in a StoryCorps booth.
p360
aVIt's a chance to have a sense of closure with someone you care about \u2014
p361
aVno regrets, nothing left unsaid.
p362
aVAnd it's hard and it takes courage,
p363
aVbut that's why we're alive, right?
p364
aa(lp365
VSo, the TED Prize.
p366
aVWhen I first heard from TED and Chris a few months ago
p367
aVabout the possibility of the Prize, I was completely floored.
p368
aVThey asked me to come up with a very brief wish for humanity,
p369
aVno more than 50 words.
p370
aVSo I thought about it, I wrote my 50 words,
p371
aVand a few weeks later, Chris called and said, "Go for it."
p372
aa(lp373
VSo here is my wish:
p374
aVthat you will help us
p375
aVtake everything we've learned through StoryCorps
p376
aVand bring it to the world
p377
aVso that anyone anywhere can easily record a meaningful interview
p378
aVwith another human being which will then be archived for history.
p379
aa(lp380
VHow are we going to do that? With this.
p381
aVWe're fast moving into a future where everyone in the world
p382
aVwill have access to one of these,
p383
aVand it has powers I never could have imagined 11 years ago
p384
aVwhen I started StoryCorps.
p385
aVIt has a microphone,
p386
aVit can tell you how to do things,
p387
aVand it can send audio files.
p388
aVThose are the key ingredients.
p389
aa(lp390
VSo the first part of the wish is already underway.
p391
aVOver the past couple of months,
p392
aVthe team at StoryCorps has been working furiously
p393
aVto create an app that will bring StoryCorps out of our booths
p394
aVso that it can be experienced by anyone, anywhere, anytime.
p395
aVRemember, StoryCorps has always been two people and a facilitator
p396
aVhelping them record their conversation, which is preserved forever,
p397
aVbut at this very moment,
p398
aVwe're releasing a public beta version of the StoryCorps app.
p399
aVThe app is a digital facilitator that walks you through
p400
aVthe StoryCorps interview process,
p401
aVhelps you pick questions,
p402
aVand gives you all the tips you need
p403
aVto record a meaningful StoryCorps interview,
p404
aVand then with one tap upload it  to our archive at the Library of Congress.
p405
aa(lp406
VThat's the easy part, the technology.
p407
aVThe real challenge is up to you:
p408
aVto take this tool and figure out how we can use it
p409
aVall across America and around the world,
p410
aVso that instead of recording thousands of StoryCorps interviews a year,
p411
aVwe could potentially record tens of thousands
p412
aVor hundreds of thousands
p413
aVor maybe even more.
p414
aa(lp415
VImagine, for example, a national homework assignment
p416
aVwhere every high school student studying U.S. history across the country
p417
aVrecords an interview with an elder over Thanksgiving,
p418
aVso that in one single weekend
p419
aVan entire generation of American lives and experiences are captured.
p420
aV(Applause)
p421
aVOr imagine mothers on opposite sides of a conflict somewhere in the world
p422
aVsitting down not to talk about that conflict
p423
aVbut to find out who they are as people,
p424
aVand in doing so, begin to build bonds of trust;
p425
aVor that someday it becomes a tradition all over the world
p426
aVthat people are honored with a StoryCorps interview
p427
aVon their 75th birthday;
p428
aVor that people in your community
p429
aVgo into retirement homes or hospitals or homeless shelters or even prisons
p430
aVarmed with this app to honor the people least heard in our society
p431
aVand ask them who they are, what they've learned in life,
p432
aVand how they want to be remembered.
p433
aV(Applause)
p434
aa(lp435
VTen years ago, I recorded a StoryCorps interview with my dad
p436
aVwho was a psychiatrist, and became a well-known gay activist.
p437
aVThis is the picture of us at that interview.
p438
aVI never thought about that recording until a couple of years ago,
p439
aVwhen my dad, who seemed to be in perfect health
p440
aVand was still seeing patients 40 hours a week,
p441
aVwas diagnosed with cancer.
p442
aVHe passed away very suddenly a few days later.
p443
aVIt was June 28, 2012,
p444
aVthe anniversary of the Stonewall riots.
p445
aa(lp446
VI listened to that interview for the first time at three in the morning
p447
aVon the day that he died.
p448
aVI have a couple of young kids at home,
p449
aVand I knew that the only way they were going to get to know this person
p450
aVwho was such a towering figure in my life would be through that session.
p451
aVI thought I couldn't believe in StoryCorps any more deeply than I did,
p452
aVbut it was at that moment
p453
aVthat I fully and viscerally grasped the importance of making these recordings.
p454
aa(lp455
VEvery day, people come up to me
p456
aVand say, "I wish I had interviewed my father or my grandmother or my brother,
p457
aVbut I waited too long."
p458
aVNow, no one has to wait anymore.
p459
aVAt this moment,
p460
aVwhen so much of how we communicate is fleeting and inconsequential,
p461
aVjoin us in creating this digital archive
p462
aVof conversations that are enduring and important.
p463
aVHelp us create this gift to our children,
p464
aVthis testament to who we are as human beings.
p465
aVI hope you'll help us make this wish come true.
p466
aVInterview a family member, a friend or even a stranger.
p467
aVTogether, we can create an archive of the wisdom of humanity,
p468
aVand maybe in doing so,
p469
aVwe'll learn to listen a little more and shout a little less.
p470
aVMaybe these conversations will remind us what's really important.
p471
aVAnd maybe, just maybe,
p472
aVit will help us recognize that simple truth
p473
aVthat every life, every single life,
p474
aVmatters equally and infinitely.
p475
aVThank you very much.
p476
aV(Applause)
p477
aVThank you. Thank you.
p478
aV(Applause)
p479
aVThank you.

VI should tell you that when I was asked to be here,
p5
aVI thought to myself that well, it's TED.
p6
aVAnd these TEDsters are \u2014 you know, as innocent as that name sounds \u2014
p7
aVthese are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world.
p8
aVAnd what could I possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough
p9
aVto justify my participation in something like that?
p10
aVAnd so I thought perhaps a really civilized-sounding British accent
p11
aVmight help things a bit.
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd then I thought no, no. I should just get up there and be myself
p14
aVand just talk the way I really talk
p15
aVbecause, after all, this is the great unveiling.
p16
aVAnd so I thought I'd come up here and unveil my real voice to you.
p17
aVAlthough many of you already know that I do speak the Queen's English
p18
aVbecause I am from Queens, New York.
p19
aV(Laughter)
p20
aVBut the theme of this session, of course, is invention.
p21
aVAnd while I don't have any patents that I'm aware of,
p22
aVyou will be meeting a few of my inventions today.
p23
aVI suppose it's fair to say
p24
aVthat I am interested in the invention of self or selves.
p25
aVWe're all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits,
p26
aVunique developmental experiences, geographical and historical contexts.
p27
aVBut then what?
p28
aVTo what extent do we self-construct, do we self-invent?
p29
aVHow do we self-identify and how mutable is that identity?
p30
aVLike, what if one could be anyone at any time?
p31
aVWell my characters, like the ones in my shows,
p32
aVallow me to play with the spaces between those questions.
p33
aVAnd so I've brought a couple of them with me.
p34
aVAnd well, they're very excited.
p35
aVWhat I should tell you \u2014
p36
aVwhat I should tell you is that they've each prepared their own little TED talks.
p37
aVSo feel free to think of this as Sarah University.
p38
aV(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VOkay. Okay. Oh, well.
p41
aVOh, wonderful.
p42
aVGood evening everybody.
p43
aVThank you so very much for having me here today.
p44
aVAh, thank you very much. My name is Lorraine Levine.
p45
aVOh my! There's so many of you.
p46
aVHi sweetheart. Okay.
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aVAnyway, I am here because of a young girl, Sarah Jones.
p49
aVShe's a very nice, young black girl.
p50
aVWell you know, she calls herself black \u2014
p51
aVshe's really more like a caramel color if you look at her.
p52
aVBut anyway.
p53
aV(Laughter)
p54
aVShe has me here because she puts me in her show,
p55
aVwhat she calls her one-woman show.
p56
aVAnd you know what that means, of course.
p57
aVThat means she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work.
p58
aVBut I don't mind.
p59
aa(lp60
VFrankly, I'm kvelling just to be here
p61
aVwith all the luminaries you have attending something like this, you know.
p62
aVReally, it's amazing.
p63
aVNot only, of course, the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries
p64
aVbut the celebrities.
p65
aVThere are so many celebrities running around here.
p66
aVI saw \u2014 Glenn Close I saw earlier. I love her.
p67
aVAnd she was getting a yogurt in the Google cafe.
p68
aVIsn't that adorable?
p69
aV(Laughter)
p70
aVSo many others you see, they're just wonderful.
p71
aVIt's lovely to know they're concerned, you know.
p72
aVAnd \u2014 oh, I saw Goldie Hawn.
p73
aVOh, Goldie Hawn. I love her, too; she's wonderful. Yeah.
p74
aVYou know, she's only half Jewish.
p75
aVDid you know that about her?
p76
aVYeah. But even so, a wonderful talent. (Laughter)
p77
aVAnd I \u2014 you know, when I saw her, such a wonderful feeling.
p78
aVYeah, she's lovely.
p79
aVBut anyway, I should have started by saying just how lucky I feel.
p80
aVIt's such an eye-opening experience to be here.
p81
aVYou're all so responsible for this world that we live in today.
p82
aVYou know, I couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl.
p83
aVAnd you've all made these advancements happen in such a short time \u2014
p84
aVyou're all so young.
p85
aVYou know, your parents must be very proud.
p86
aa(lp87
VBut I \u2014 I also appreciate the diversity that you have here.
p88
aVI noticed it's very multicultural.
p89
aVYou know, when you're standing up here, you can see all the different people.
p90
aVIt's like a rainbow.
p91
aVIt's okay to say rainbow. Yeah.
p92
aVI just \u2014 I can't keep up with whether you can say, you know, the different things.
p93
aVWhat are you allowed to say or not say?
p94
aVI just \u2014 I don't want to offend anybody. You know.
p95
aVBut anyway, you know,
p96
aVI just think that to be here with all of you
p97
aVaccomplished young people \u2014
p98
aVliterally, some of you, the architects building our brighter future.
p99
aVYou know, it's heartening to me.
p100
aVEven though, quite frankly, some of your presentations are horrifying,
p101
aVabsolutely horrifying.
p102
aVIt's true. It's true.
p103
aVYou know, between the environmental degradation
p104
aVand the crashing of the world markets you're talking about.
p105
aVAnd of course, we know it's all because of the \u2014 all the ...
p106
aVWell, I don't know how else to say it to you, so I'll just say it my way:
p107
aVthe ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the, you know,
p108
aVthe bankers and the Wall Street. You know it.
p109
aVAnyway.
p110
aV(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VThe point is, I'm happy somebody has practical ideas
p113
aVto get us out of this mess.
p114
aVSo I salute each of you and your stellar achievements.
p115
aVThank you for all that you do.
p116
aVAnd congratulations on being such big makhers that you've become TED meisters.
p117
aVSo, happy continued success.
p118
aVCongratulations. Mazel tov.
p119
aV(Applause)
p120
aa(lp121
VHi. Hi.
p122
aVThank you everybody.
p123
aVSorry, this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything, to be here right now.
p124
aVMy name is Noraida. And I'm just \u2014
p125
aVI'm so thrilled to be part of like your TED conference
p126
aVthat you're doing and everything like that.
p127
aVI am Dominican-American.
p128
aVActually, you could say I grew up in the capital of Dominican Republic,
p129
aVotherwise known as Washington Heights in New York City.
p130
aVBut I don't know if there's any other Dominican people here,
p131
aVbut I know that Juan Enriquez, he was here yesterday.
p132
aVAnd I think he's Mexican, so that's \u2014
p133
aVhonestly, that's close enough for me right now. So \u2014
p134
aV(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VI just \u2014 I'm sorry.
p137
aVI'm just trying not to be nervous because this is
p138
aVa very wonderful experience for me and everything.
p139
aVAnd I just \u2014 you know I'm not used to doing the public speaking.
p140
aVAnd whenever I get nervous I start to talk really fast.
p141
aVNobody can understand nothing I'm saying, which is very frustrating for me,
p142
aVas you can imagine.
p143
aVI usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath.
p144
aVBut then on top of that, you know, Sarah Jones told me we only have 18 minutes.
p145
aVSo then I'm like, should I be nervous, you know, because maybe it's better.
p146
aVAnd I'm just trying not to panic and freak out. So I like, take a deep breath.
p147
aa(lp148
VOkay. Sorry. So anyway, what I was trying to say is that I really love TED.
p149
aVLike, I love everything about this. It's amazing.
p150
aVLike, it's \u2014 I can't get over this right now.
p151
aVAnd, like, people would not believe, seriously, where I'm from,
p152
aVthat this even exists.
p153
aVYou know, like even, I mean I love like the name, the \u2014 TED.
p154
aVI mean I know it's a real person and everything, but I'm just saying that like,
p155
aVyou know, I think it's very cool how it's also an acronym, you know,
p156
aVwhich is like, you know, is like very high concept and everything like that.
p157
aVI like that.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd actually, I can relate to the whole like acronym thing and everything.
p160
aVBecause, actually, I'm a sophomore at college right now.
p161
aVAt my school \u2014 actually I was part of co-founding an organization,
p162
aVwhich is like a leadership thing,
p163
aVyou know, like you guys, you would really like it and everything.
p164
aVAnd the organization is called DA BOMB,
p165
aVA\u005cand DA BOMB \u2014 not like what you guys can build and everything \u2014
p166
aVit's like, DA BOMB, it means like Dominican \u2014 it's an acronym \u2014
p167
aVDominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies.
p168
aVSo, I know, see, like the name is like a little bit long,
p169
aVbut with the war on terror and everything,
p170
aVthe Dean of Student Activities has asked us to stop saying DA BOMB
p171
aVand use the whole thing so nobody would get the wrong idea, whatever.
p172
aVSo, basically like DA BOMB \u2014
p173
aVwhat Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies does
p174
aVis, basically, we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise
p175
aVand who also happen to be mothers like me.
p176
aVI am a working mother, and I also go to school full-time.
p177
aVAnd, you know, it's like \u2014 it's so important to have like role models out there.
p178
aVI mean, I know sometimes our lifestyles are very different, whatever.
p179
aa(lp180
VBut like even at my job \u2014 like, I just got promoted.
p181
aVRight now it's very exciting actually for me
p182
aVbecause I'm the Junior Assistant to the Associate Director
p183
aVunder the Senior Vice President for Business Development \u2014
p184
aVthat's my new title.
p185
aVSo, but I think whether you own your own company or you're just starting out like me,
p186
aVlike something like this is so vital
p187
aVfor people to just continue expanding their minds and learning.
p188
aVAnd if everybody, like all people really had access to that,
p189
aVit would be a very different world out there, as I know you know.
p190
aVSo, I think all people, we need that,
p191
aVbut especially, I look at people like me, you know like,
p192
aVI mean, Latinos \u2014 we're about to be the majority, in like two weeks.
p193
aVSo, we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else.
p194
aVSo, I'm very happy that you're, you know, doing this kind of thing,
p195
aVmaking the talks available online.
p196
aVThat's very good. I love that.
p197
aVAnd I just \u2014 I love you guys. I love TED.
p198
aVAnd if you don't mind, privately now, in the future, I'm going to think of TED
p199
aVas an acronym for Technology, Entertainment and Dominicans.
p200
aVThank you very much.
p201
aV(Laughter)
p202
aV(Applause)
p203
aa(lp204
VSo, that was Noraida,
p205
aVand just like Lorraine and everybody else you're meeting today,
p206
aVthese are folks who are based on real people from my real life:
p207
aVfriends, neighbors, family members.
p208
aVI come from a multicultural family.
p209
aVIn fact, the older lady you just met:
p210
aVvery, very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother's side.
p211
aVIt's a long story, believe me.
p212
aVBut on top of my family background,
p213
aVmy parents also sent me to the United Nations school,
p214
aVwhere I encountered a plethora of new characters,
p215
aVincluding Alexandre, my French teacher, okay.
p216
aa(lp217
VWell, you know, it was beginner French, that I am taking with her, you know.
p218
aVAnd it was Madame Bousson, you know, she was very [French].
p219
aVIt was like, you know, she was there in the class,
p220
aVyou know, she was kind of typically French.
p221
aVYou know, she was very chic, but she was very filled with ennui, you know.
p222
aVAnd she would be there, you know, kind of talking with the class, you know,
p223
aVtalking about the, you know, the existential futility of life, you know.
p224
aVAnd we were only 11 years old, so it was not appropriate. (Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
VBut [German].
p227
aVYes, I took German for three years, [German],
p228
aVand it was quite the experience because I was the only black girl in the class,
p229
aVeven in the UN school.
p230
aVAlthough, you know, it was wonderful.
p231
aVThe teacher, Herr Schtopf, he never discriminated.
p232
aVNever. He always, always treated each of us,
p233
aVyou know, equally unbearably during the class.
p234
aa(lp235
VSo, there were the teachers and then there were my friends,
p236
aVclassmates from everywhere,
p237
aVmany of whom are still dear friends to this day.
p238
aVAnd they've inspired many characters as well.
p239
aVFor example, a friend of mine.
p240
aa(lp241
VWell, I just wanted to quickly say good evening.
p242
aVMy name is Praveen Manvi and thank you very much for this opportunity.
p243
aVOf course, TED, the reputation precedes itself all over the world.
p244
aVBut, you know, I am originally from India,
p245
aVand I wanted to start by telling you
p246
aVthat once Sarah Jones told me that we will be having the opportunity
p247
aVto come here to TED in California,
p248
aVoriginally, I was very pleased and, frankly, relieved
p249
aVbecause, you know, I am a human rights advocate.
p250
aVAnd usually my work, it takes me to Washington D.C.
p251
aVAnd there, I must attend these meetings, mingling with some tiresome politicians,
p252
aVtrying to make me feel comfortable
p253
aVby telling how often they are eating the curry in Georgetown. (Laughter)
p254
aVSo, you can just imagine \u2014 right.
p255
aVSo, but I'm thrilled to be joining all of you here.
p256
aVI wish we had more time together, but that's for another time. Okay? Great.
p257
aV(Applause)
p258
aa(lp259
VAnd, sadly, I don't think we'll have time for you to meet everybody I brought, but \u2014
p260
aVI'm trying to behave myself,
p261
aVit's my first time here.
p262
aVBut I do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize,
p263
aVif you saw "Bridge and Tunnel."
p264
aa(lp265
VUh, well, thank you.
p266
aVGood evening.
p267
aVMy name is Pauline Ning,
p268
aVand first I want to tell you that I'm \u2014
p269
aVof course I am a member of the Chinese community in New York.
p270
aVBut when Sarah Jones asked me to please come to TED,
p271
aVI said, well, you know, first, I don't know that, you know \u2014
p272
aVbefore two years ago, you would not find me in front of an audience of people,
p273
aVmuch less like this
p274
aVbecause I did not like to give speeches
p275
aVbecause I feel that, as an immigrant, I do not have good English skills for speaking.
p276
aVBut then, I decided, just like Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger,
p277
aVI try anyway.
p278
aV(Laughter)
p279
aVMy daughter \u2014 my daughter wrote that,
p280
aVshe told me, "Always start your speech with humor."
p281
aa(lp282
VBut my background \u2014
p283
aVI want to tell you story only briefly.
p284
aVMy husband and I, we brought our son and daughter here in 1980s
p285
aVto have the freedom we cannot have in China at that time.
p286
aVAnd we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition, but it's very hard.
p287
aVYou know, as immigrant, I would speak Chinese to them,
p288
aVand they would always answer me back in English.
p289
aVThey love rock music, pop culture, American culture.
p290
aVBut when they got older,
p291
aVwhen the time comes for them to start think about getting married,
p292
aVthat's when we expect them to realize, a little bit more, their own culture.
p293
aVBut that's where we had some problems.
p294
aVMy son, he says he is not ready to get married.
p295
aVAnd he has a sweetheart, but she is American woman, not Chinese.
p296
aVIt's not that it's bad, but I told him, "What's wrong with a Chinese woman?"
p297
aVBut I think he will change his mind soon.
p298
aa(lp299
VSo, then I decide instead, I will concentrate on my daughter.
p300
aVThe daughter's marriage is very special to the mom.
p301
aVBut first, she said she's not interested.
p302
aVShe only wants to spend time with her friends.
p303
aVAnd then at college, it's like she never came home.
p304
aVAnd she doesn't want me to come and visit.
p305
aVSo I said, "What's wrong in this picture?"
p306
aVSo, I accused my daughter to have like a secret boyfriend.
p307
aVBut she told me, "Mom, you don't have to worry about boys
p308
aVbecause I don't like them."
p309
aV(Laughter)
p310
aVAnd I said, "Yes, men can be difficult, but all women have to get used to that."
p311
aVShe said, "No Mom. I mean, I don't like boys. I like girls.
p312
aVI am lesbian."
p313
aVSo, I always teach my kids to respect American ideas,
p314
aVbut I told my daughter that this is one exception \u2014
p315
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p316
aVthat she is not gay, she is just confused by this American problem.
p317
aVBut she told me, "Mom, it's not American."
p318
aVShe said she is in love \u2014 in love with a nice Chinese girl.
p319
aV(Laughter)
p320
aVSo, these are the words I am waiting to hear,
p321
aVbut from my son, not my daughter.
p322
aV(Laughter)
p323
aVBut at first I did not know what to do.
p324
aVBut then, over time, I have come to understand that this is who she is.
p325
aa(lp326
VSo, even though sometimes it's still hard,
p327
aVI will share with you that it helps me to realize
p328
aVsociety is more tolerant, usually because of places like this,
p329
aVbecause of ideas like this,
p330
aVand people like you, with an open mind.
p331
aVSo I think maybe TED, you impact people's lives
p332
aVin the ways maybe even you don't realize.
p333
aVSo, for my daughter's sake,
p334
aVI thank you for your ideas worth spreading.
p335
aVThank you. Xie xie.
p336
aV(Applause)
p337
aa(lp338
VGood evening. My name is Habbi Belahal.
p339
aVAnd I would like to first of all thank Sarah Jones
p340
aVfor putting all of the pressure on the only Arab who she brought with her
p341
aVto be last today.
p342
aVI am originally from Jordan.
p343
aVAnd I teach comparative literature at Queens College.
p344
aVIt is not Harvard.
p345
aVBut I feel a bit like a fish out of water.
p346
aVBut I am very proud of my students.
p347
aVAnd I see that a few of them did make it here to the conference.
p348
aVSo you will get the extra credit I promised you.
p349
aVBut, while I know that I may not look like the typical TED-izen, as you would say,
p350
aVI do like to make the point that we in global society,
p351
aVwe are never as different as the appearances may suggest.
p352
aa(lp353
VSo, if you will indulge me, I will share quickly with you a bit of verse,
p354
aVwhich I memorized as a young girl at 16 years of age.
p355
aVSo, back in the ancient times.
p356
aV[Arabic]
p357
aVAnd this roughly translates:
p358
aV"Please, let me hold your hand.
p359
aVI want to hold your hand.
p360
aVI want to hold your hand.
p361
aVAnd when I touch you, I feel happy inside.
p362
aVIt's such a feeling that my love, I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide."
p363
aVWell, so okay, but please, please, but please.
p364
aVIf it is sounding familiar, it is because I was at the same time in my life
p365
aVlistening to the Beatles.
p366
aVOn the radio [unclear], they were very popular.
p367
aa(lp368
VSo, all of that is to say that I like to believe
p369
aVthat for every word intended as to render us deaf to one another,
p370
aVthere is always a lyric connecting ears and hearts across the continents in rhyme.
p371
aVAnd I pray that this is the way that we will self-invent, in time.
p372
aVThat's all, shukran. Thank you very much for the opportunity.
p373
aVOkay? Great.
p374
aV(Applause)
p375
aa(lp376
VThank you all very much. It was lovely.
p377
aVThank you for having me.
p378
aV(Applause)
p379
aVThank you very, very much. I love you.
p380
aV(Applause)
p381
aVWell, you have to let me say this.
p382
aVI just \u2014 thank you.
p383
aVI want to thank Chris and Jacqueline, and just everyone for having me here.
p384
aVIt's been a long time coming, and I feel like I'm home.
p385
aVAnd I know I've performed for some of your companies
p386
aVor some of you have seen me elsewhere,
p387
aVbut this is honestly one of the best audiences I've ever experienced.
p388
aVThe whole thing is amazing, and so don't you all go reinventing yourselves any time soon.
p389
aV(Applause)

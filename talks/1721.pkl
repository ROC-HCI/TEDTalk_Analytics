VLiu Bolin: By making myself invisible,
p5
aVI try to question the inter-canceling relationship
p6
aVbetween our civilization and its development.
p7
aVInterpreter: By making myself invisible, I try to explore and question
p8
aVthe contradictory and often inter-canceling relationship
p9
aVbetween our civilization and its development.
p10
aa(lp11
VLB: This is my first work, created in November 2005.
p12
aVAnd this is Beijing International Art Camp where I worked
p13
aVbefore the government forcibly demolished it.I used this work to express my objection.
p14
aVI also want to use this work to let more people
p15
aVpay attention to the living condition of artists and the condition of their creative freedom.
p16
aVIn the meantime, from the beginning, this series has a
p17
aVprotesting, reflective
p18
aVand uncompromising spirit.
p19
aVWhen applying makeup, I borrow a sniper's method
p20
aVto better protect myself
p21
aVand to detect the enemy, as he did. (Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VAfter finishing this series of protests,
p24
aVI started questioning why my fate was like this,
p25
aVand I realized that it's not just me \u2014
p26
aVall Chinese are as confused as I am.
p27
aVAs you can see, these works
p28
aVare about family planning, election in accordance with the law
p29
aVand propaganda of the institution of the People's Congress.
p30
aa(lp31
VThis work is called Xia Gang ("leaving post").
p32
aV"Xia Gang" is a Chinese euphemism for "laid off".
p33
aVIt refers to those people who lost their jobs during China's transition from a planned economy to a market economy.
p34
aVFrom 1998 to 2000,
p35
aV21.37 million people
p36
aVlost their jobs in China.
p37
aVThe six people in the photo
p38
aVare Xia Gang workers.
p39
aVI made them invisible in the deserted shop wherethey had lived and worked all their lives.
p40
aVOn the wall behind them is the slogan of the Cultural Revolution:
p41
aV"The core force leading our cause forward is the Chinese Communist Party."
p42
aVFor half a month
p43
aVI looked for these 6 people to participate in my work.
p44
aVWe can only see six men in this picture,but in fact, those who are hidden here
p45
aVare all people who were laid off. They have just been made invisible.
p46
aa(lp47
VThis piece is called The Studio.
p48
aVThis spring,
p49
aVI happened to have an opportunity during my solo exhibition in Paris
p50
aVto shoot a work in the news studio of France 3 \u2014
p51
aVI picked the news photos of the day.
p52
aVOne is about the war in the Middle East,
p53
aVand another one is about a public demonstration in France.
p54
aVI found that any culture has its irreconcilable contradictions.
p55
aa(lp56
VThis is a joint effort between me and French artist JR.
p57
aVInterpreter: This is a joint effort between me and French artist JR.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Applause)
p60
aa(lp61
VLB: I tried to disappear into JR's eye,
p62
aVbut the problem is JR only uses models with big eyes.
p63
aVSo I tried to make my eyes bigger with my fingers.
p64
aVBut still they are not big enough for JR, unfortunately.
p65
aVInterpreter: So I tried to disappear into JR's eye,
p66
aVbut the problem is JR uses only models with big eyes.
p67
aVSo I tried to make my eyes bigger with this gesture.
p68
aVBut it doesn't work, my eyes are still small.
p69
aa(lp70
VLB: This one is about 9/11 memories.
p71
aa(lp72
VThis is an aircraft carrier moored alongside the Hudson River.
p73
aa(lp74
VKenny Scharf's graffiti.
p75
aV(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VThis is Venice, Italy.
p78
aVBecause global temperatures rise,
p79
aVthe sea level rises, and it is said thatVenice will disappear in the coming decades.
p80
aVThis is the ancient city of Pompeii.
p81
aVInterpreter: This is the ancient city of Pompeii.
p82
aVLB: This is the Borghese Gallery
p83
aVin Rome.
p84
aa(lp85
VWhen I work on a new piece, I pay more attention to the expression of ideas.
p86
aVFor instance, why would I make myself invisible?
p87
aVWhat will making myself invisible here cause people to think?
p88
aa(lp89
VThis one is called Instant Noodles.
p90
aVInterpreter: This one is called Instant Noodles. (Laughter)
p91
aVLB: Since August 2012,
p92
aVharmful phosphors have been found
p93
aVin the instant noodle package cups from every famous brand sold in China's supermarkets.
p94
aVThese phosphors can even cause cancer.
p95
aVTo create this artwork,
p96
aVI bought a lot of packaged instant noodle cups
p97
aVand put them in my studio, making it look like a supermarket.
p98
aVAnd my task is to stand there, trying to be still,
p99
aVsetting up the camera position and coordinating with my assistant
p100
aVand drawing the colors and shapes that are behind my body
p101
aVon the front of my body. If the background is simple,
p102
aVI usually have to stand for three to four hours.
p103
aVThe background of this piece is more complex,
p104
aVso I need three to four days in advance for preparation.
p105
aVThis is the suit I wore when I did the supermarket shoot.
p106
aVThere is no Photoshop involved.
p107
aVInterpreter: This is the suit I [was] wearing when I did the supermarket shoot.
p108
aVThere is no Photoshop involved. (Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VLB: These works are on China's cultural memories.
p111
aa(lp112
VAnd this one,
p113
aVthis is about food safety in China.
p114
aVUnsafe food can harm people's health,
p115
aVand a deluge of magazines can confuse people's minds. (Laughter)
p116
aVThe next pieces of work show how I made myself invisible in magazines of different languages,
p117
aVin different countries and at different times.
p118
aa(lp119
VI think that in art, an artist's attitude is the most important element.
p120
aVIf an artwork is to touch someone,
p121
aVit must be the result of not only technique, but also the artist's thinking and struggle in life.
p122
aVAnd the repeated struggles in life create artwork,
p123
aVno matter in what form.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Music)
p126
aa(lp127
VThat's all I want to say.
p128
aa(lp129
VThank you. (Applause)

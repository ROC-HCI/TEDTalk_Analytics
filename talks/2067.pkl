VTen years ago, I wrote a book which I entitled
p5
aV"Our Final Century?" Question mark.
p6
aVMy publishers cut out the question mark. (Laughter)
p7
aVThe American publishers changed our title
p8
aVto "Our Final Hour."
p9
aVAmericans like instant gratification and the reverse.
p10
aV(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VAnd my theme was this:
p13
aVOur Earth has existed for 45 million centuries,
p14
aVbut this one is special \u2014
p15
aVit's the first where one species, ours,
p16
aVhas the planet's future in its hands.
p17
aVOver nearly all of Earth's history,
p18
aVthreats have come from nature \u2014
p19
aVdisease, earthquakes, asteroids and so forth \u2014
p20
aVbut from now on, the worst dangers come from us.
p21
aVAnd it's now not just the nuclear threat;
p22
aVin our interconnected world,
p23
aVnetwork breakdowns can cascade globally;
p24
aVair travel can spread pandemics worldwide within days;
p25
aVand social media can spread panic and rumor
p26
aVliterally at the speed of light.
p27
aVWe fret too much about minor hazards \u2014
p28
aVimprobable air crashes, carcinogens in food,
p29
aVlow radiation doses, and so forth \u2014
p30
aVbut we and our political masters
p31
aVare in denial about catastrophic scenarios.
p32
aVThe worst have thankfully not yet happened.
p33
aVIndeed, they probably won't.
p34
aVBut if an event is potentially devastating,
p35
aVit's worth paying a substantial premium
p36
aVto safeguard against it, even if it's unlikely,
p37
aVjust as we take out fire insurance on our house.
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd as science offers greater power and promise,
p40
aVthe downside gets scarier too.
p41
aVWe get ever more vulnerable.
p42
aVWithin a few decades,
p43
aVmillions will have the capability
p44
aVto misuse rapidly advancing biotech,
p45
aVjust as they misuse cybertech today.
p46
aVFreeman Dyson, in a TED Talk,
p47
aVforesaw that children will design and create new organisms
p48
aVjust as routinely as his generation played with chemistry sets.
p49
aVWell, this may be on the science fiction fringe,
p50
aVbut were even part of his scenario to come about,
p51
aVour ecology and even our species
p52
aVwould surely not survive long unscathed.
p53
aVFor instance, there are some eco-extremists
p54
aVwho think that it would be better for the planet,
p55
aVfor Gaia, if there were far fewer humans.
p56
aVWhat happens when such people have mastered
p57
aVsynthetic biology techniques
p58
aVthat will be widespread by 2050?
p59
aVAnd by then, other science fiction nightmares
p60
aVmay transition to reality:
p61
aVdumb robots going rogue,
p62
aVor a network that develops a mind of its own
p63
aVthreatens us all.
p64
aa(lp65
VWell, can we guard against such risks by regulation?
p66
aVWe must surely try, but these enterprises
p67
aVare so competitive, so globalized,
p68
aVand so driven by commercial pressure,
p69
aVthat anything that can be done will be done somewhere,
p70
aVwhatever the regulations say.
p71
aVIt's like the drug laws \u2014 we try to regulate, but can't.
p72
aVAnd the global village will have its village idiots,
p73
aVand they'll have a global range.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo as I said in my book,
p76
aVwe'll have a bumpy ride through this century.
p77
aVThere may be setbacks to our society \u2014
p78
aVindeed, a 50 percent chance of a severe setback.
p79
aVBut are there conceivable events
p80
aVthat could be even worse,
p81
aVevents that could snuff out all life?
p82
aVWhen a new particle accelerator came online,
p83
aVsome people anxiously asked,
p84
aVcould it destroy the Earth or, even worse,
p85
aVrip apart the fabric of space?
p86
aVWell luckily, reassurance could be offered.
p87
aVI and others pointed out that nature
p88
aVhas done the same experiments
p89
aVzillions of times already,
p90
aVvia cosmic ray collisions.
p91
aVBut scientists should surely be precautionary
p92
aVabout experiments that generate conditions
p93
aVwithout precedent in the natural world.
p94
aVBiologists should avoid release of potentially devastating
p95
aVgenetically modified pathogens.
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd by the way, our special aversion
p98
aVto the risk of truly existential disasters
p99
aVdepends on a philosophical and ethical question,
p100
aVand it's this:
p101
aVConsider two scenarios.
p102
aVScenario A wipes out 90 percent of humanity.
p103
aVScenario B wipes out 100 percent.
p104
aVHow much worse is B than A?
p105
aVSome would say 10 percent worse.
p106
aVThe body count is 10 percent higher.
p107
aVBut I claim that B is incomparably worse.
p108
aVAs an astronomer, I can't believe
p109
aVthat humans are the end of the story.
p110
aVIt is five billion years before the sun flares up,
p111
aVand the universe may go on forever,
p112
aVso post-human evolution,
p113
aVhere on Earth and far beyond,
p114
aVcould be as prolonged as the Darwinian process
p115
aVthat's led to us, and even more wonderful.
p116
aVAnd indeed, future evolution will happen much faster,
p117
aVon a technological timescale,
p118
aVnot a natural selection timescale.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo we surely, in view of those immense stakes,
p121
aVshouldn't accept even a one in a billion risk
p122
aVthat human extinction would foreclose
p123
aVthis immense potential.
p124
aVSome scenarios that have been envisaged
p125
aVmay indeed be science fiction,
p126
aVbut others may be disquietingly real.
p127
aVIt's an important maxim that the unfamiliar
p128
aVis not the same as the improbable,
p129
aVand in fact, that's why we at Cambridge University
p130
aVare setting up a center to study how to mitigate
p131
aVthese existential risks.
p132
aVIt seems it's worthwhile just for a few people
p133
aVto think about these potential disasters.
p134
aVAnd we need all the help we can get from others,
p135
aVbecause we are stewards of a precious
p136
aVpale blue dot in a vast cosmos,
p137
aVa planet with 50 million centuries ahead of it.
p138
aVAnd so let's not jeopardize that future.
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd I'd like to finish with a quote
p141
aVfrom a great scientist called Peter Medawar.
p142
aVI quote, "The bells that toll for mankind
p143
aVare like the bells of Alpine cattle.
p144
aVThey are attached to our own necks,
p145
aVand it must be our fault if they do not make
p146
aVa tuneful and melodious sound."
p147
aa(lp148
VThank you very much.

VSo, stepping down out of the bus,
p5
aVI headed back to the corner
p6
aVto head west en route to a braille training session.
p7
aVIt was the winter of 2009,
p8
aVand I had been blind for about a year.
p9
aVThings were going pretty well.
p10
aVSafely reaching the other side,
p11
aVI turned to the left,
p12
aVpushed the auto-button for the audible pedestrian signal,
p13
aVand waited my turn.
p14
aVAs it went off, I took off
p15
aVand safely got to the other side.
p16
aVStepping onto the sidewalk,
p17
aVI then heard the sound of a steel chair
p18
aVslide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me.
p19
aVI know there's a cafe on the corner,
p20
aVand they have chairs out in front,
p21
aVso I just adjusted to the left
p22
aVto get closer to the street.
p23
aVAs I did, so slid the chair.
p24
aVI just figured I'd made a mistake,
p25
aVand went back to the right,
p26
aVand so slid the chair in perfect synchronicity.
p27
aVNow I was getting a little anxious.
p28
aVI went back to the left,
p29
aVand so slid the chair,
p30
aVblocking my path of travel.
p31
aVNow, I was officially freaking out.
p32
aVSo I yelled,
p33
aV"Who the hell's out there? What's going on?"
p34
aVJust then, over my shout,
p35
aVI heard something else, a familiar rattle.
p36
aVIt sounded familiar,
p37
aVand I quickly considered another possibility,
p38
aVand I reached out with my left hand,
p39
aVas my fingers brushed against something fuzzy,
p40
aVand I came across an ear,
p41
aVthe ear of a dog, perhaps a golden retriever.
p42
aVIts leash had been tied to the chair
p43
aVas her master went in for coffee,
p44
aVand she was just persistent in her efforts
p45
aVto greet me, perhaps get a scratch behind the ear.
p46
aVWho knows, maybe she was volunteering for service.
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VBut that little story is really about
p50
aVthe fears and misconceptions that come along
p51
aVwith the idea of moving through the city
p52
aVwithout sight,
p53
aVseemingly oblivious to the environment
p54
aVand the people around you.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo let me step back and set the stage a little bit.
p57
aVOn St. Patrick's Day of 2008,
p58
aVI reported to the hospital for surgery
p59
aVto remove a brain tumor.
p60
aVThe surgery was successful.
p61
aVTwo days later, my sight started to fail.
p62
aVOn the third day, it was gone.
p63
aa(lp64
VImmediately, I was struck by an incredible sense
p65
aVof fear, of confusion, of vulnerability,
p66
aVlike anybody would.
p67
aVBut as I had time to stop and think,
p68
aVI actually started to realize
p69
aVI had a lot to be grateful for.
p70
aVIn particular, I thought about my dad,
p71
aVwho had passed away from complications
p72
aVfrom brain surgery.
p73
aVHe was 36. I was seven at the time.
p74
aVSo although I had every reason
p75
aVto be fearful of what was ahead,
p76
aVand had no clue quite what was going to happen,
p77
aVI was alive.
p78
aVMy son still had his dad.
p79
aVAnd besides, it's not like I was the first person
p80
aVever to lose their sight.
p81
aVI knew there had to be all sorts of systems
p82
aVand techniques and training to have
p83
aVto live a full and meaningful, active life
p84
aVwithout sight.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo by the time I was discharged from the hospital
p87
aVa few days later, I left with a mission,
p88
aVa mission to get out and get the best training
p89
aVas quickly as I could and get on to rebuilding my life.
p90
aVWithin six months, I had returned to work.
p91
aVMy training had started.
p92
aVI even started riding a tandem bike
p93
aVwith my old cycling buddies,
p94
aVand was commuting to work on my own,
p95
aVwalking through town and taking the bus.
p96
aVIt was a lot of hard work.
p97
aa(lp98
VBut what I didn't anticipate
p99
aVthrough that rapid transition
p100
aVwas the incredible experience of the juxtaposition
p101
aVof my sighted experience up against my unsighted experience
p102
aVof the same places and the same people
p103
aVwithin such a short period of time.
p104
aa(lp105
VFrom that came a lot of insights,
p106
aVor outsights, as I called them,
p107
aVthings that I learned since losing my sight.
p108
aVThese outsights ranged from the trival
p109
aVto the profound,
p110
aVfrom the mundane to the humorous.
p111
aVAs an architect, that stark juxtaposition
p112
aVof my sighted and unsighted experience
p113
aVof the same places and the same cities
p114
aVwithin such a short period of time
p115
aVhas given me all sorts of wonderful outsights
p116
aVof the city itself.
p117
aVParamount amongst those
p118
aVwas the realization that, actually,
p119
aVcities are fantastic places for the blind.
p120
aVAnd then I was also surprised
p121
aVby the city's propensity for kindness and care
p122
aVas opposed to indifference or worse.
p123
aVAnd then I started to realize that
p124
aVit seemed like the blind seemed to have
p125
aVa positive influence on the city itself.
p126
aVThat was a little curious to me.
p127
aa(lp128
VLet me step back and take a look
p129
aVat why the city is so good for the blind.
p130
aVInherent with the training for recovery from sight loss
p131
aVis learning to rely on all your non-visual senses,
p132
aVthings that you would otherwise maybe ignore.
p133
aVIt's like a whole new world of sensory information
p134
aVopens up to you.
p135
aVI was really struck by the symphony
p136
aVof subtle sounds all around me in the city
p137
aVthat you can hear and work with
p138
aVto understand where you are,
p139
aVhow you need to move, and where you need to go.
p140
aVSimilarly, just through the grip of the cane,
p141
aVyou can feel contrasting textures in the floor below,
p142
aVand over time you build a pattern of where you are
p143
aVand where you're headed.
p144
aVSimilarly, just the sun warming one side of your face
p145
aVor the wind at your neck
p146
aVgives you clues about your alignment
p147
aVand your progression through a block
p148
aVand your movement through time and space.
p149
aVBut also, the sense of smell.
p150
aVSome districts and cities have their own smell,
p151
aVas do places and things around you,
p152
aVand if you're lucky, you can even follow your nose
p153
aVto that new bakery that you've been looking for.
p154
aa(lp155
VAll this really surprised me,
p156
aVbecause I started to realize that
p157
aVmy unsighted experienced
p158
aVwas so far more multi-sensory
p159
aVthan my sighted experience ever was.
p160
aVWhat struck me also was how much the city
p161
aVwas changing around me.
p162
aVWhen you're sighted,
p163
aVeverybody kind of sticks to themselves,
p164
aVyou mind your own business.
p165
aVLose your sight, though,
p166
aVand it's a whole other story.
p167
aVAnd I don't know who's watching who,
p168
aVbut I have a suspicion that a lot of people are watching me.
p169
aVAnd I'm not paranoid, but everywhere I go,
p170
aVI'm getting all sorts of advice:
p171
aVGo here, move there, watch out for this.
p172
aVA lot of the information is good.
p173
aVSome of it's helpful. A lot of it's kind of reversed.
p174
aVYou've got to figure out what they actually meant.
p175
aVSome of it's kind of wrong and not helpful.
p176
aVBut it's all good in the grand scheme of things.
p177
aa(lp178
VBut one time I was in Oakland
p179
aVwalking along Broadway, and came to a corner.
p180
aVI was waiting for an audible pedestrian signal,
p181
aVand as it went off, I was just about to step out into the street,
p182
aVwhen all of a sudden, my right hand
p183
aVwas just gripped by this guy,
p184
aVand he yanked my arm and pulled me out into the crosswalk
p185
aVand was dragging me out across the street,
p186
aVspeaking to me in Mandarin.
p187
aV(Laughter)
p188
aVIt's like, there was no escape from this man's death grip,
p189
aVbut he got me safely there.
p190
aVWhat could I do?
p191
aVBut believe me, there are more polite ways
p192
aVto offer assistance.
p193
aVWe don't know you're there,
p194
aVso it's kind of nice to say "Hello" first.
p195
aV"Would you like some help?"
p196
aa(lp197
VBut while in Oakland, I've really been struck by
p198
aVhow much the city of Oakland changed
p199
aVas I lost my sight.
p200
aVI liked it sighted. It was fine.
p201
aVIt's a perfectly great city.
p202
aVBut once I lost my sight
p203
aVand was walking along Broadway,
p204
aVI was blessed every block of the way.
p205
aa(lp206
V"Bless you, man."
p207
aa(lp208
V"Go for it, brother."
p209
aa(lp210
V"God bless you."
p211
aa(lp212
VI didn't get that sighted.
p213
aV(Laughter)
p214
aVAnd even without sight, I don't get that in San Francisco.
p215
aVAnd I know it bothers some of my blind friends,
p216
aVit's not just me.
p217
aVOften it's thought that
p218
aVthat's an emotion that comes up out of pity.
p219
aVI tend to think that it comes out of our shared humanity,
p220
aVout of our togetherness, and I think it's pretty cool.
p221
aVIn fact, if I'm feeling down,
p222
aVI just go to Broadway in downtown Oakland,
p223
aVI go for a walk, and I feel better like that,
p224
aVin no time at all.
p225
aa(lp226
VBut also that it illustrates how
p227
aVdisability and blindness
p228
aVsort of cuts across ethnic, social,
p229
aVracial, economic lines.
p230
aVDisability is an equal-opportunity provider.
p231
aVEverybody's welcome.
p232
aVIn fact, I've heard it said in the disability community
p233
aVthat there are really only two types of people:
p234
aVThere are those with disabilities,
p235
aVand there are those that haven't quite found theirs yet.
p236
aVIt's a different way of thinking about it,
p237
aVbut I think it's kind of beautiful,
p238
aVbecause it is certainly far more inclusive
p239
aVthan the us-versus-them
p240
aVor the abled-versus-the-disabled,
p241
aVand it's a lot more honest and respectful
p242
aVof the fragility of life.
p243
aa(lp244
VSo my final takeaway for you is
p245
aVthat not only is the city good for the blind,
p246
aVbut the city needs us.
p247
aVAnd I'm so sure of that that
p248
aVI want to propose to you today
p249
aVthat the blind be taken as the prototypical city dwellers
p250
aVwhen imagining new and wonderful cities,
p251
aVand not the people that are thought about
p252
aVafter the mold has already been cast.
p253
aVIt's too late then.
p254
aVSo if you design a city with the blind in mind,
p255
aVyou'll have a rich, walkable network of sidewalks
p256
aVwith a dense array of options and choices
p257
aVall available at the street level.
p258
aVIf you design a city with the blind in mind,
p259
aVsidewalks will be predictable and will be generous.
p260
aVThe space between buildings will be well-balanced
p261
aVbetween people and cars.
p262
aVIn fact, cars, who needs them?
p263
aVIf you're blind, you don't drive. (Laughter)
p264
aVThey don't like it when you drive. (Laughter)
p265
aVIf you design a city with the blind in mind,
p266
aVyou design a city with a robust,
p267
aVaccessible, well-connected mass transit system
p268
aVthat connects all parts of the city
p269
aVand the region all around.
p270
aVIf you design a city with the blind in mind,
p271
aVthere'll be jobs, lots of jobs.
p272
aVBlind people want to work too.
p273
aVThey want to earn a living.
p274
aa(lp275
VSo, in designing a city for the blind,
p276
aVI hope you start to realize
p277
aVthat it actually would be a more inclusive,
p278
aVa more equitable, a more just city for all.
p279
aVAnd based on my prior sighted experience,
p280
aVit sounds like a pretty cool city,
p281
aVwhether you're blind, whether you have a disability,
p282
aVor you haven't quite found yours yet.
p283
aa(lp284
VSo thank you.
p285
aa(lp286
V(Applause)

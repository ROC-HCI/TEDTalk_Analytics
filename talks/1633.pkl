VI'm a neuroscientist, and I study decision-making.
p5
aVI do experiments to test how different chemicals
p6
aVin the brain influence the choices we make.
p7
aa(lp8
VI'm here to tell you the secret to successful decision-making:
p9
aVa cheese sandwich.
p10
aVThat's right. According to scientists, a cheese sandwich
p11
aVis the solution to all your tough decisions.
p12
aa(lp13
VHow do I know? I'm the scientist who did the study.
p14
aa(lp15
VA few years ago, my colleagues and I were interested
p16
aVin how a brain chemical called serotonin
p17
aVwould influence people's decisions in social situations.
p18
aVSpecifically, we wanted to know how serotonin would affect
p19
aVthe way people react when they're treated unfairly.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo we did an experiment.
p22
aVWe manipulated people's serotonin levels by giving them
p23
aVthis really disgusting-tasting artificial lemon-flavored drink
p24
aVthat works by taking away the raw ingredient for serotonin
p25
aVin the brain.
p26
aVThis is the amino acid tryptophan.
p27
aVSo what we found was, when tryptophan was low,
p28
aVpeople were more likely to take revenge
p29
aVwhen they're treated unfairly.
p30
aa(lp31
VThat's the study we did, and here are some of the headlines
p32
aVthat came out afterwards.
p33
aa(lp34
V("A cheese sandwich is all you need for strong decision-making")
p35
aa(lp36
V("What a friend we have in cheeses")
p37
aa(lp38
V("Eating Cheese and Meat May Boost Self-Control") At this point, you might be wondering, did I miss something?
p39
aa(lp40
V("Official! Chocolate stops you being grumpy") Cheese? Chocolate? Where did that come from?
p41
aVAnd I thought the same thing myself when these came out,
p42
aVbecause our study had nothing to do with cheese or chocolate.
p43
aVWe gave people this horrible-tasting drink
p44
aVthat affected their tryptophan levels.
p45
aVBut it turns out that tryptophan also happens to be found
p46
aVin cheese and chocolate.
p47
aVAnd of course when science says cheese and chocolate
p48
aVhelp you make better decisions, well, that's sure to grab people's attention.
p49
aVSo there you have it:
p50
aVthe evolution of a headline.
p51
aa(lp52
VWhen this happened, a part of me thought, well,
p53
aVwhat's the big deal?
p54
aVSo the media oversimplified a few things, but in the end,
p55
aVit's just a news story.
p56
aVAnd I think a lot of scientists have this attitude.
p57
aVBut the problem is that this kind of thing happens all the time,
p58
aVand it affects not just the stories you read in the news
p59
aVbut also the products you see on the shelves.
p60
aVWhen the headlines rolled, what happened was,
p61
aVthe marketers came calling.
p62
aVWould I be willing to provide a scientific endorsement
p63
aVof a mood-boosting bottled water?
p64
aVOr would I go on television to demonstrate,
p65
aVin front of a live audience,
p66
aVthat comfort foods really do make you feel better?
p67
aVI think these folks meant well, but had I taken them up on their offers,
p68
aVI would have been going beyond the science,
p69
aVand good scientists are careful not to do this.
p70
aa(lp71
VBut nevertheless, neuroscience is turning up more and more in marketing.
p72
aVHere's one example: Neuro drinks,
p73
aVa line of products, including Nuero Bliss here,
p74
aVwhich according to its label helps reduce stress,
p75
aVenhances mood, provides focused concentration,
p76
aVand promotes a positive outlook.
p77
aVI have to say, this sounds awesome. (Laughter)
p78
aVI could totally have used this 10 minutes ago.
p79
aVSo when this came up in my local shop, naturally I was
p80
aVcurious about some of the research backing these claims.
p81
aVSo I went to the company's website looking to find
p82
aVsome controlled trials of their products.
p83
aVBut I didn't find any.
p84
aa(lp85
VTrial or no trial, these claims are front and center
p86
aVon their label right next to a picture of a brain.
p87
aVAnd it turns out that pictures of brains have special properties.
p88
aVA couple of researchers asked a few hundred people
p89
aVto read a scientific article.
p90
aVFor half the people, the article included a brain image,
p91
aVand for the other half, it was the same article
p92
aVbut it didn't have a brain image.
p93
aVAt the end \u2014 you see where this is going \u2014
p94
aVpeople were asked whether they agreed
p95
aVwith the conclusions of the article.
p96
aVSo this is how much people agree with the conclusions
p97
aVwith no image.
p98
aVAnd this is how much they agree with the same article
p99
aVthat did include a brain image.
p100
aVSo the take-home message here is,
p101
aVdo you want to sell it? Put a brain on it.
p102
aa(lp103
VNow let me pause here and take a moment to say that
p104
aVneuroscience has advanced a lot in the last few decades,
p105
aVand we're constantly discovering amazing things
p106
aVabout the brain.
p107
aVLike, just a couple of weeks ago, neuroscientists at MIT
p108
aVfigured out how to break habits in rats
p109
aVjust by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain.
p110
aVReally cool stuff.
p111
aVBut the promise of neuroscience has led to some really
p112
aVhigh expectations and some overblown, unproven claims.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo what I'm going to do is show you how to spot
p115
aVa couple of classic moves, dead giveaways, really,
p116
aVfor what's variously been called neuro-bunk,
p117
aVneuro-bollocks, or, my personal favorite, neuro-flapdoodle.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo the first unproven claim is that you can use brain scans
p120
aVto read people's thoughts and emotions.
p121
aVHere's a study published by a team of researchers
p122
aVas an op-ed in The New York Times.
p123
aVThe headline? "You Love Your iPhone. Literally."
p124
aVIt quickly became the most emailed article on the site.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo how'd they figure this out?
p127
aVThey put 16 people inside a brain scanner
p128
aVand showed them videos of ringing iPhones.
p129
aVThe brain scans showed activation in a part of the brain
p130
aVcalled the insula, a region they say
p131
aVis linked to feelings of love and compassion.
p132
aVSo they concluded that because they saw activation in the insula,
p133
aVthis meant the subjects loved their iPhones.
p134
aVNow there's just one problem with this line of reasoning,
p135
aVand that's that the insula does a lot.
p136
aVSure, it is involved in positive emotions
p137
aVlike love and compassion,
p138
aVbut it's also involved in tons of other processes,
p139
aVlike memory, language, attention,
p140
aVeven anger, disgust and pain.
p141
aVSo based on the same logic, I could equally conclude
p142
aVyou hate your iPhone.
p143
aVThe point here is, when you see activation in the insula,
p144
aVyou can't just pick and choose your favorite explanation
p145
aVfrom off this list, and it's a really long list.
p146
aVMy colleagues Tal Yarkoni and Russ Poldrack
p147
aVhave shown that the insula pops up in almost a third
p148
aVof all brain imaging studies that have ever been published.
p149
aVSo chances are really, really good
p150
aVthat your insula is going off right now,
p151
aVbut I won't kid myself
p152
aVto think this means you love me.
p153
aa(lp154
VSo speaking of love and the brain,
p155
aVthere's a researcher, known to some as Dr. Love,
p156
aVwho claims that scientists have found the glue
p157
aVthat holds society together,
p158
aVthe source of love and prosperity.
p159
aVThis time it's not a cheese sandwich.
p160
aVNo, it's a hormone called oxytocin.
p161
aVYou've probably heard of it.
p162
aVSo, Dr. Love bases his argument on studies showing
p163
aVthat when you boost people's oxytocin,
p164
aVthis increases their trust, empathy and cooperation.
p165
aVSo he's calling oxytocin "the moral molecule."
p166
aa(lp167
VNow these studies are scientifically valid,
p168
aVand they've been replicated, but they're not the whole story.
p169
aVOther studies have shown that boosting oxytocin
p170
aVincreases envy. It increases gloating.
p171
aVOxytocin can bias people to favor their own group
p172
aVat the expense of other groups.
p173
aVAnd in some cases, oxytocin can even decrease cooperation.
p174
aVSo based on these studies, I could say oxytocin
p175
aVis an immoral molecule, and call myself Dr. Strangelove.
p176
aV(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
VSo we've seen neuro-flapdoodle all over the headlines.
p179
aVWe see it in supermarkets, on book covers.
p180
aVWhat about the clinic?
p181
aa(lp182
VSPECT imaging is a brain-scanning technology
p183
aVthat uses a radioactive tracer
p184
aVto track blood flow in the brain.
p185
aVFor the bargain price of a few thousand dollars,
p186
aVthere are clinics in the U.S. that will give you
p187
aVone of these SPECT scans and use the image
p188
aVto help diagnose your problems.
p189
aVThese scans, the clinics say, can help
p190
aVprevent Alzheimer's disease,
p191
aVsolve weight and addiction issues,
p192
aVovercome marital conflicts,
p193
aVand treat, of course, a variety of mental illnesses
p194
aVranging from depression to anxiety to ADHD.
p195
aVThis sounds great. A lot of people agree.
p196
aVSome of these clinics are pulling in tens of millions
p197
aVof dollars a year in business.
p198
aa(lp199
VThere's just one problem.
p200
aVThe broad consensus in neuroscience
p201
aVis that we can't yet diagnose mental illness
p202
aVfrom a single brain scan.
p203
aVBut these clinics have treated
p204
aVtens of thousands of patients to date,
p205
aVmany of them children,
p206
aVand SPECT imaging involves a radioactive injection,
p207
aVso exposing people to radiation, potentially harmful.
p208
aa(lp209
VI am more excited than most people, as a neuroscientist,
p210
aVabout the potential for neuroscience to treat mental illness
p211
aVand even maybe to make us better and smarter.
p212
aVAnd if one day we can say that cheese and chocolate
p213
aVhelp us make better decisions, count me in.
p214
aVBut we're not there yet.
p215
aVWe haven't found a "buy" button inside the brain,
p216
aVwe can't tell whether someone is lying or in love
p217
aVjust by looking at their brain scans,
p218
aVand we can't turn sinners into saints with hormones.
p219
aVMaybe someday we will, but until then,
p220
aVwe have to be careful that we don't let overblown claims
p221
aVdetract resources and attention away from the real science
p222
aVthat's playing a much longer game.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo here's where you come in.
p225
aVIf someone tries to sell you something with a brain on it,
p226
aVdon't just take them at their word.
p227
aVAsk the tough questions. Ask to see the evidence.
p228
aVAsk for the part of the story that's not being told.
p229
aVThe answers shouldn't be simple, because the brain isn't simple.
p230
aVBut that's not stopping us from trying to figure it out anyway.
p231
aa(lp232
VThank you. (Applause)

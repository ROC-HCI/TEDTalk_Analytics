VLook, I had second thoughts, really,
p5
aVabout whether I could talk about this
p6
aVto such a vital and alive audience as you guys.
p7
aVThen I remembered the quote from Gloria Steinem,
p8
aVwhich goes,
p9
aV"The truth will set you free,
p10
aVbut first it will piss you off." (Laughter)
p11
aVSo \u2014 (Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VSo with that in mind, I'm going to set about
p14
aVtrying to do those things here,
p15
aVand talk about dying in the 21st century.
p16
aVNow the first thing that will piss you off, undoubtedly,
p17
aVis that all of us are, in fact, going to die
p18
aVin the 21st century.
p19
aVThere will be no exceptions to that.
p20
aVThere are, apparently, about one in eight of you
p21
aVwho think you're immortal, on surveys, but \u2014
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aVUnfortunately, that isn't going to happen.
p24
aa(lp25
VWhile I give this talk, in the next 10 minutes,
p26
aVa hundred million of my cells will die,
p27
aVand over the course of today, 2,000 of my brain cells
p28
aVwill die and never come back,
p29
aVso you could argue that the dying process
p30
aVstarts pretty early in the piece.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnyway, the second thing I want to say about dying in the
p33
aV21st century, apart from it's going to happen to everybody,
p34
aVis it's shaping up to be a bit of a train wreck
p35
aVfor most of us,
p36
aVunless we do something to try and reclaim this process
p37
aVfrom the rather inexorable trajectory that it's currently on.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo there you go. That's the truth.
p40
aVNo doubt that will piss you off, and now let's see
p41
aVwhether we can set you free. I don't promise anything.
p42
aVNow, as you heard in the intro, I work in intensive care,
p43
aVand I think I've kind of lived through the heyday
p44
aVof intensive care. It's been a ride, man.
p45
aVThis has been fantastic.
p46
aVWe have machines that go ping.
p47
aVThere's many of them up there.
p48
aVAnd we have some wizard technology which I think
p49
aVhas worked really well, and over the course of the time
p50
aVI've worked in intensive care, the death rate
p51
aVfor males in Australia has halved,
p52
aVand intensive care has had something to do with that.
p53
aVCertainly, a lot of the technologies that we use
p54
aVhave got something to do with that.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo we have had tremendous success, and we kind of
p57
aVgot caught up in our own success quite a bit,
p58
aVand we started using expressions like "lifesaving."
p59
aVI really apologize to everybody for doing that,
p60
aVbecause obviously, we don't.
p61
aVWhat we do is prolong people's lives,
p62
aVand delay death,
p63
aVand redirect death, but we can't, strictly speaking,
p64
aVsave lives on any sort of permanent basis.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd what's really happened over the period of time
p67
aVthat I've been working in intensive care is that
p68
aVthe people whose lives we started saving back in the '70s,
p69
aV'80s, and '90s, are now coming to die in the 21st century
p70
aVof diseases that we no longer have the answers to
p71
aVin quite the way we did then.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo what's happening now is there's been a big shift
p74
aVin the way that people die,
p75
aVand most of what they're dying of now isn't as amenable
p76
aVto what we can do as what it used to be like
p77
aVwhen I was doing this in the '80s and '90s.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo we kind of got a bit caught up with this,
p80
aVand we haven't really squared with you guys about
p81
aVwhat's really happening now, and it's about time we did.
p82
aVI kind of woke up to this bit in the late '90s
p83
aVwhen I met this guy.
p84
aVThis guy is called Jim, Jim Smith, and he looked like this.
p85
aVI was called down to the ward to see him.
p86
aVHis is the little hand.
p87
aVI was called down to the ward to see him
p88
aVby a respiratory physician.
p89
aVHe said, "Look, there's a guy down here.
p90
aVHe's got pneumonia,
p91
aVand he looks like he needs intensive care.
p92
aVHis daughter's here and she wants everything possible
p93
aVto be done."
p94
aVWhich is a familiar phrase to us.
p95
aVSo I go down to the ward and see Jim,
p96
aVand his skin his translucent like this.
p97
aVYou can see his bones through the skin.
p98
aVHe's very, very thin,
p99
aVand he is, indeed, very sick with pneumonia,
p100
aVand he's too sick to talk to me,
p101
aVso I talk to his daughter Kathleen, and I say to her,
p102
aV"Did you and Jim ever talk about
p103
aVwhat you would want done
p104
aVif he ended up in this kind of situation?"
p105
aVAnd she looked at me and said, "No, of course not!"
p106
aVI thought, "Okay. Take this steady."
p107
aVAnd I got talking to her, and after a while, she said to me,
p108
aV"You know, we always thought there'd be time."
p109
aa(lp110
VJim was 94. (Laughter)
p111
aVAnd I realized that something wasn't happening here.
p112
aVThere wasn't this dialogue going on
p113
aVthat I imagined was happening.
p114
aVSo a group of us started doing survey work,
p115
aVand we looked at four and a half thousand nursing home
p116
aVresidents in Newcastle, in the Newcastle area,
p117
aVand discovered that only one in a hundred of them
p118
aVhad a plan about what to do when their hearts stopped beating.
p119
aVOne in a hundred.
p120
aVAnd only one in 500 of them had plan about what to do
p121
aVif they became seriously ill.
p122
aVAnd I realized, of course, this dialogue
p123
aVis definitely not occurring in the public at large.
p124
aa(lp125
VNow, I work in acute care.
p126
aVThis is John Hunter Hospital.
p127
aVAnd I thought, surely, we do better than that.
p128
aVSo a colleague of mine from nursing called Lisa Shaw and I
p129
aVwent through hundreds and hundreds of sets of notes
p130
aVin the medical records department
p131
aVlooking at whether there was any sign at all
p132
aVthat anybody had had any conversation about
p133
aVwhat might happen to them if the treatment they were
p134
aVreceiving was unsuccessful to the point that they would die.
p135
aVAnd we didn't find a single record of any preference
p136
aVabout goals, treatments or outcomes from any
p137
aVof the sets of notes initiated by a doctor or by a patient.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo we started to realize
p140
aVthat we had a problem,
p141
aVand the problem is more serious because of this.
p142
aa(lp143
VWhat we know is that obviously we are all going to die,
p144
aVbut how we die is actually really important,
p145
aVobviously not just to us, but also to how that
p146
aVfeatures in the lives of all the people who live on afterwards.
p147
aVHow we die lives on in the minds of everybody
p148
aVwho survives us, and
p149
aVthe stress created in families by dying is enormous,
p150
aVand in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying
p151
aVin intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else,
p152
aVso dying in intensive care is not your top option
p153
aVif you've got a choice.
p154
aa(lp155
VAnd, if that wasn't bad enough, of course,
p156
aVall of this is rapidly progressing towards the fact that
p157
aVmany of you, in fact, about one in 10 of you at this point,
p158
aVwill die in intensive care.
p159
aVIn the U.S., it's one in five.
p160
aVIn Miami, it's three out of five people die in intensive care.
p161
aVSo this is the sort of momentum
p162
aVthat we've got at the moment.
p163
aa(lp164
VThe reason why this is all happening is due to this,
p165
aVand I do have to take you through what this is about.
p166
aVThese are the four ways to go.
p167
aVSo one of these will happen to all of us.
p168
aVThe ones you may know most about are the ones
p169
aVthat are becoming increasingly of historical interest:
p170
aVsudden death.
p171
aVIt's quite likely in an audience this size
p172
aVthis won't happen to anybody here.
p173
aVSudden death has become very rare.
p174
aVThe death of Little Nell and Cordelia and all that sort of stuff
p175
aVjust doesn't happen anymore.
p176
aVThe dying process of those with terminal illness
p177
aVthat we've just seen
p178
aVoccurs to younger people.
p179
aVBy the time you've reached 80, this is unlikely to happen to you.
p180
aVOnly one in 10 people who are over 80 will die of cancer.
p181
aa(lp182
VThe big growth industry are these.
p183
aVWhat you die of is increasing organ failure,
p184
aVwith your respiratory, cardiac, renal,
p185
aVwhatever organs packing up. Each of these
p186
aVwould be an admission to an acute care hospital,
p187
aVat the end of which, or at some point during which,
p188
aVsomebody says, enough is enough, and we stop.
p189
aa(lp190
VAnd this one's the biggest growth industry of all,
p191
aVand at least six out of 10 of the people in this room
p192
aVwill die in this form, which is
p193
aVthe dwindling of capacity
p194
aVwith increasing frailty,
p195
aVand frailty's an inevitable part of aging,
p196
aVand increasing frailty is in fact the main thing
p197
aVthat people die of now,
p198
aVand the last few years, or the last year of your life
p199
aVis spent with a great deal of disability, unfortunately.
p200
aa(lp201
VEnjoying it so far? (Laughs)
p202
aV(Laughter)
p203
aVSorry, I just feel such a, I feel such a Cassandra here.
p204
aV(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VWhat can I say that's positive? What's positive is
p207
aVthat this is happening at very great age, now.
p208
aVWe are all, most of us, living to reach this point.
p209
aVYou know, historically, we didn't do that.
p210
aVThis is what happens to you
p211
aVwhen you live to be a great age,
p212
aVand unfortunately, increasing longevity does mean
p213
aVmore old age, not more youth.
p214
aVI'm sorry to say that. (Laughter)
p215
aVWhat we did, anyway, look, what we did,
p216
aVwe didn't just take this lying down
p217
aVat John Hunter Hospital and elsewhere.
p218
aVWe've started a whole series of projects
p219
aVto try and look about whether we could, in fact, involve
p220
aVpeople much more in the way that things happen to them.
p221
aVBut we realized, of course, that we are dealing
p222
aVwith cultural issues,
p223
aVand this is, I love this Klimt painting,
p224
aVbecause the more you look at it, the more you kind of get
p225
aVthe whole issue that's going on here,
p226
aVwhich is clearly the separation of death from the living,
p227
aVand the fear \u2014 Like, if you actually look,
p228
aVthere's one woman there
p229
aVwho has her eyes open.
p230
aVShe's the one he's looking at,
p231
aVand [she's] the one he's coming for. Can you see that?
p232
aVShe looks terrified.
p233
aVIt's an amazing picture.
p234
aa(lp235
VAnyway, we had a major cultural issue.
p236
aVClearly, people didn't want us to talk about death,
p237
aVor, we thought that.
p238
aVSo with loads of funding from the Federal Government
p239
aVand the local Health Service, we introduced a thing
p240
aVat John Hunter called Respecting Patient Choices.
p241
aVWe trained hundreds of people to go to the wards
p242
aVand talk to people about the fact that they would die,
p243
aVand what would they prefer under those circumstances.
p244
aVThey loved it. The families and the patients, they loved it.
p245
aVNinety-eight percent of people really thought
p246
aVthis just should have been normal practice,
p247
aVand that this is how things should work.
p248
aVAnd when they expressed wishes,
p249
aVall of those wishes came true, as it were.
p250
aVWe were able to make that happen for them.
p251
aVBut then, when the funding ran out,
p252
aVwe went back to look six months later,
p253
aVand everybody had stopped again,
p254
aVand nobody was having these conversations anymore.
p255
aVSo that was really kind of heartbreaking for us,
p256
aVbecause we thought this was going to really take off.
p257
aVThe cultural issue had reasserted itself.
p258
aa(lp259
VSo here's the pitch:
p260
aVI think it's important that we don't just get on this freeway
p261
aVto ICU without thinking hard about whether or not
p262
aVthat's where we all want to end up,
p263
aVparticularly as we become older and increasingly frail
p264
aVand ICU has less and less and less to offer us.
p265
aVThere has to be a little side road
p266
aVoff there for people who don't want to go on that track.
p267
aVAnd I have one small idea,
p268
aVand one big idea about what could happen.
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd this is the small idea.
p271
aVThe small idea is, let's all of us
p272
aVengage more with this in the way that Jason has illustrated.
p273
aVWhy can't we have these kinds of conversations
p274
aVwith our own elders
p275
aVand people who might be approaching this?
p276
aVThere are a couple of things you can do.
p277
aVOne of them is, you can,
p278
aVjust ask this simple question. This question never fails.
p279
aV"In the event that you became too sick to speak for yourself,
p280
aVwho would you like to speak for you?"
p281
aVThat's a really important question to ask people,
p282
aVbecause giving people the control over who that is
p283
aVproduces an amazing outcome.
p284
aVThe second thing you can say is,
p285
aV"Have you spoken to that person
p286
aVabout the things that are important to you
p287
aVso that we've got a better idea of what it is we can do?"
p288
aVSo that's the little idea.
p289
aa(lp290
VThe big idea, I think, is more political.
p291
aVI think we have to get onto this.
p292
aVI suggested we should have Occupy Death.
p293
aV(Laughter)
p294
aVMy wife said, "Yeah, right, sit-ins in the mortuary.
p295
aVYeah, yeah. Sure." (Laughter)
p296
aVSo that one didn't really run,
p297
aVbut I was very struck by this.
p298
aVNow, I'm an aging hippie.
p299
aVI don't know, I don't think I look like that anymore, but
p300
aVI had, two of my kids were born at home in the '80s
p301
aVwhen home birth was a big thing, and we baby boomers
p302
aVare used to taking charge of the situation,
p303
aVso if you just replace all these words of birth,
p304
aVI like "Peace, Love, Natural Death" as an option.
p305
aVI do think we have to get political
p306
aVand start to reclaim this process from
p307
aVthe medicalized model in which it's going.
p308
aa(lp309
VNow, listen, that sounds like a pitch for euthanasia.
p310
aVI want to make it absolutely crystal clear to you all,
p311
aVI hate euthanasia. I think it's a sideshow.
p312
aVI don't think euthanasia matters.
p313
aVI actually think that,
p314
aVin places like Oregon,
p315
aVwhere you can have physician-assisted suicide,
p316
aVyou take a poisonous dose of stuff,
p317
aVonly half a percent of people ever do that.
p318
aVI'm more interested in what happens to the 99.5 percent
p319
aVof people who don't want to do that.
p320
aVI think most people don't want to be dead,
p321
aVbut I do think most people want to have some control
p322
aVover how their dying process proceeds.
p323
aVSo I'm an opponent of euthanasia,
p324
aVbut I do think we have to give people back some control.
p325
aVIt deprives euthanasia of its oxygen supply.
p326
aVI think we should be looking at stopping
p327
aVthe want for euthanasia,
p328
aVnot for making it illegal or legal or worrying about it at all.
p329
aa(lp330
VThis is a quote from Dame Cicely Saunders,
p331
aVwhom I met when I was a medical student.
p332
aVShe founded the hospice movement.
p333
aVAnd she said, "You matter because you are,
p334
aVand you matter to the last moment of your life."
p335
aVAnd I firmly believe that
p336
aVthat's the message that we have to carry forward.
p337
aVThank you. (Applause)

VJust after Christmas last year,
p5
aV132 kids in California got the measles
p6
aVby either visiting Disneyland
p7
aVor being exposed to someone who'd been there.
p8
aVThe virus then hopped the Canadian border,
p9
aVinfecting more than 100 children in Quebec.
p10
aVOne of the tragic things about this outbreak
p11
aVis that measles, which can be fatal to a child with a weakened immune system,
p12
aVis one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.
p13
aVAn effective vaccine against it
p14
aVhas been available for more than half a century,
p15
aVbut many of the kids involved in the Disneyland outbreak
p16
aVhad not been vaccinated
p17
aVbecause their parents were afraid
p18
aVof something allegedly even worse:
p19
aVautism.
p20
aa(lp21
VBut wait \u2014 wasn't the paper that sparked the controversy
p22
aVabout autism and vaccines
p23
aVdebunked, retracted,
p24
aVand branded a deliberate fraud
p25
aVby the British Medical Journal?
p26
aVDon't most science-savvy people
p27
aVknow that the theory that vaccines cause autism is B.S.?
p28
aVI think most of you do,
p29
aVbut millions of parents worldwide
p30
aVcontinue to fear that vaccines put their kids at risk for autism.
p31
aa(lp32
VWhy?
p33
aVHere's why.
p34
aVThis is a graph of autism prevalence estimates rising over time.
p35
aVFor most of the 20th century,
p36
aVautism was considered an incredibly rare condition.
p37
aVThe few psychologists and pediatricians who'd even heard of it
p38
aVfigured they would get through their entire careers
p39
aVwithout seeing a single case.
p40
aVFor decades, the prevalence estimates remained stable
p41
aVat just three or four children in 10,000.
p42
aVBut then, in the 1990s,
p43
aVthe numbers started to skyrocket.
p44
aVFundraising organizations like Autism Speaks
p45
aVroutinely refer to autism as an epidemic,
p46
aVas if you could catch it from another kid at Disneyland.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo what's going on?
p49
aVIf it isn't vaccines, what is it?
p50
aVIf you ask the folks down at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta
p51
aVwhat's going on,
p52
aVthey tend to rely on phrases like "broadened diagnostic criteria"
p53
aVand "better case finding"
p54
aVto explain these rising numbers.
p55
aVBut that kind of language
p56
aVdoesn't do much to allay the fears of a young mother
p57
aVwho is searching her two-year-old's face for eye contact.
p58
aVIf the diagnostic criteria had to be broadened,
p59
aVwhy were they so narrow in the first place?
p60
aVWhy were cases of autism so hard to find
p61
aVbefore the 1990s?
p62
aa(lp63
VFive years ago, I decided to try to uncover the answers to these questions.
p64
aVI learned that what happened
p65
aVhas less to do with the slow and cautious progress of science
p66
aVthan it does with the seductive power of storytelling.
p67
aVFor most of the 20th century,
p68
aVclinicians told one story
p69
aVabout what autism is and how it was discovered,
p70
aVbut that story turned out to be wrong,
p71
aVand the consequences of it
p72
aVare having a devastating impact on global public health.
p73
aVThere was a second, more accurate story of autism
p74
aVwhich had been lost and forgotten
p75
aVin obscure corners of the clinical literature.
p76
aVThis second story tells us everything about how we got here
p77
aVand where we need to go next.
p78
aa(lp79
VThe first story starts with a child psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins Hospital
p80
aVnamed Leo Kanner.
p81
aVIn 1943, Kanner published a paper
p82
aVdescribing 11 young patients who seemed to inhabit private worlds,
p83
aVignoring the people around them,
p84
aVeven their own parents.
p85
aVThey could amuse themselves for hours
p86
aVby flapping their hands in front of their faces,
p87
aVbut they were panicked by little things
p88
aVlike their favorite toy being moved from its usual place
p89
aVwithout their knowledge.
p90
aVBased on the patients who were brought to his clinic,
p91
aVKanner speculated that autism is very rare.
p92
aVBy the 1950s, as the world's leading authority on the subject,
p93
aVhe declared that he had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome
p94
aVwhile fielding referrals from as far away as South Africa.
p95
aVThat's actually not surprising,
p96
aVbecause Kanner's criteria for diagnosing autism
p97
aVwere incredibly selective.
p98
aVFor example, he discouraged giving the diagnosis to children who had seizures
p99
aVbut now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
p100
aVHe once bragged that he had turned nine out of 10 kids
p101
aVreferred to his office as autistic by other clinicians
p102
aVwithout giving them an autism diagnosis.
p103
aa(lp104
VKanner was a smart guy,
p105
aVbut a number of his theories didn't pan out.
p106
aVHe classified autism as a form of infantile psychosis
p107
aVcaused by cold and unaffectionate parents.
p108
aVThese children, he said,
p109
aVhad been kept neatly in a refrigerator that didn't defrost.
p110
aVAt the same time, however,
p111
aVKanner noticed that some of his young patients
p112
aVhad special abilities that clustered in certain areas
p113
aVlike music, math and memory.
p114
aVOne boy in his clinic
p115
aVcould distinguish between 18 symphonies before he turned two.
p116
aVWhen his mother put on one of his favorite records,
p117
aVhe would correctly declare, "Beethoven!"
p118
aVBut Kanner took a dim view of these abilities,
p119
aVclaiming that the kids were just regurgitating things
p120
aVthey'd heard their pompous parents say,
p121
aVdesperate to earn their approval.
p122
aVAs a result, autism became a source of shame and stigma for families,
p123
aVand two generations of autistic children
p124
aVwere shipped off to institutions for their own good,
p125
aVbecoming invisible to the world at large.
p126
aa(lp127
VAmazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s
p128
aVthat researchers began to test Kanner's theory that autism was rare.
p129
aVLorna Wing was a cognitive psychologist in London
p130
aVwho thought that Kanner's theory of refrigerator parenting
p131
aVwere "bloody stupid," as she told me.
p132
aVShe and her husband John were warm and affectionate people,
p133
aVand they had a profoundly autistic daughter named Susie.
p134
aVLorna and John knew how hard it was to raise a child like Susie
p135
aVwithout support services,
p136
aVspecial education,
p137
aVand the other resources that are out of reach without a diagnosis.
p138
aVTo make the case to the National Health Service
p139
aVthat more resources were needed for autistic children and their families,
p140
aa(lp141
VLorna and her colleague Judith Gould
p142
aVdecided to do something that should have been done 30 years earlier.
p143
aVThey undertook a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
p144
aVThey pounded the pavement in a London suburb called Camberwell
p145
aVto try to find autistic children in the community.
p146
aVWhat they saw made clear that Kanner's model was way too narrow,
p147
aVwhile the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse.
p148
aVSome kids couldn't talk at all,
p149
aVwhile others waxed on at length about their fascination with astrophysics,
p150
aVdinosaurs or the genealogy of royalty.
p151
aVIn other words, these children didn't fit into nice, neat boxes,
p152
aVas Judith put it,
p153
aVand they saw lots of them,
p154
aVway more than Kanner's monolithic model would have predicted.
p155
aa(lp156
VAt first, they were at a loss to make sense of their data.
p157
aVHow had no one noticed these children before?
p158
aVBut then Lorna came upon a reference to a paper that had been published
p159
aVin German in 1944,
p160
aVthe year after Kanner's paper,
p161
aVand then forgotten,
p162
aVburied with the ashes of a terrible time
p163
aVthat no one wanted to remember or think about.
p164
aVKanner knew about this competing paper,
p165
aVbut scrupulously avoided mentioning it in his own work.
p166
aVIt had never even been translated into English,
p167
aVbut luckily, Lorna's husband spoke German,
p168
aVand he translated it for her.
p169
aa(lp170
VThe paper offered an alternate story of autism.
p171
aVIts author was a man named Hans Asperger,
p172
aVwho ran a combination clinic and residential school
p173
aVin Vienna in the 1930s.
p174
aVAsperger's ideas about teaching children with learning differences
p175
aVwere progressive even by contemporary standards.
p176
aVMornings at his clinic began with exercise classes set to music,
p177
aVand the children put on plays on Sunday afternoons.
p178
aVInstead of blaming parents for causing autism,
p179
aVAsperger framed it as a lifelong, polygenetic disability
p180
aVthat requires compassionate forms of support and accommodations
p181
aVover the course of one's whole life.
p182
aVRather than treating the kids in his clinic like patients,
p183
aVAsperger called them his little professors,
p184
aVand enlisted their help in developing methods of education
p185
aVthat were particularly suited to them.
p186
aVCrucially, Asperger viewed autism as a diverse continuum
p187
aVthat spans an astonishing range of giftedness and disability.
p188
aVHe believed that autism and autistic traits are common
p189
aVand always have been,
p190
aVseeing aspects of this continuum in familiar archetypes from pop culture
p191
aVlike the socially awkward scientist
p192
aVand the absent-minded professor.
p193
aVHe went so far as to say,
p194
aVit seems that for success in science and art,
p195
aVa dash of autism is essential.
p196
aa(lp197
VLorna and Judith realized that Kanner had been as wrong about autism being rare
p198
aVas he had been about parents causing it.
p199
aVOver the next several years,
p200
aVthey quietly worked with the American Psychiatric Association
p201
aVto broaden the criteria for diagnosis
p202
aVto reflect the diversity of what they called "the autism spectrum."
p203
aVIn the late '80s and early 1990s,
p204
aVtheir changes went into effect,
p205
aVswapping out Kanner's narrow model
p206
aVfor Asperger's broad and inclusive one.
p207
aa(lp208
VThese changes weren't happening in a vacuum.
p209
aVBy coincidence, as Lorna and Judith worked behind the scenes
p210
aVto reform the criteria,
p211
aVpeople all over the world were seeing an autistic adult for the first time.
p212
aVBefore "Rain Man" came out in 1988,
p213
aVonly a tiny, ingrown circle of experts knew what autism looked like,
p214
aVbut after Dustin Hoffman's unforgettable performance as Raymond Babbitt
p215
aVearned "Rain Man" four Academy Awards,
p216
aVpediatricians, psychologists,
p217
aVteachers and parents all over the world knew what autism looked like.
p218
aa(lp219
VCoincidentally, at the same time,
p220
aVthe first easy-to-use clinical tests for diagnosing autism were introduced.
p221
aVYou no longer had to have a connection to that tiny circle of experts
p222
aVto get your child evaluated.
p223
aa(lp224
VThe combination of "Rain Man,"
p225
aVthe changes to the criteria, and the introduction of these tests
p226
aVcreated a network effect,
p227
aVa perfect storm of autism awareness.
p228
aVThe number of diagnoses started to soar,
p229
aVjust as Lorna and Judith predicted, indeed hoped, that it would,
p230
aVenabling autistic people and their families
p231
aVto finally get the support and services they deserved.
p232
aa(lp233
VThen Andrew Wakefield came along
p234
aVto blame the spike in diagnoses on vaccines,
p235
aVa simple, powerful,
p236
aVand seductively believable story
p237
aVthat was as wrong as Kanner's theory
p238
aVthat autism was rare.
p239
aa(lp240
VIf the CDC's current estimate,
p241
aVthat one in 68 kids in America are on the spectrum, is correct,
p242
aVautistics are one of the largest minority groups in the world.
p243
aVIn recent years, autistic people have come together on the Internet
p244
aVto reject the notion that they are puzzles to be solved
p245
aVby the next medical breakthrough,
p246
aVcoining the term "neurodiversity"
p247
aVto celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
p248
aa(lp249
VOne way to understand neurodiversity
p250
aVis to think in terms of human operating systems.
p251
aVJust because a P.C. is not running Windows doesn't mean that it's broken.
p252
aVBy autistic standards, the normal human brain
p253
aVis easily distractable,
p254
aVobsessively social,
p255
aVand suffers from a deficit of attention to detail.
p256
aVTo be sure, autistic people have a hard time
p257
aVliving in a world not built for them.
p258
aV[Seventy] years later, we're still catching up to Asperger,
p259
aVwho believed that the "cure" for the most disabling aspects of autism
p260
aVis to be found in understanding teachers,
p261
aVaccommodating employers,
p262
aVsupportive communities,
p263
aVand parents who have faith in their children's potential.
p264
aa(lp265
VAn autistic [man] named Zosia Zaks once said,
p266
aV"We need all hands on deck to right the ship of humanity."
p267
aVAs we sail into an uncertain future,
p268
aVwe need every form of human intelligence on the planet
p269
aVworking together to tackle the challenges that we face as a society.
p270
aVWe can't afford to waste a brain.
p271
aa(lp272
VThank you.

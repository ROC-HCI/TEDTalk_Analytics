VWhen I was growing up in Montana,
p5
aVI had two dreams.
p6
aVI wanted to be a paleontologist,
p7
aVa dinosaur paleontologist,
p8
aVand I wanted to have a pet dinosaur.
p9
aVAnd so that's what I've been striving for
p10
aVall of my life.
p11
aVI was very fortunate
p12
aVearly in my career.
p13
aVI was fortunate
p14
aVin finding things.
p15
aVI wasn't very good at reading things.
p16
aVIn fact, I don't read much of anything.
p17
aVI am extremely dyslexic,
p18
aVand so reading is the hardest thing I do.
p19
aVBut instead, I go out and I find things.
p20
aVThen I just pick things up.
p21
aVI basically practice for finding money on the street.
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aVAnd I wander about the hills,
p24
aVand I have found a few things.
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd I have been fortunate enough
p27
aVto find things like the first eggs in the Western hemisphere
p28
aVand the first baby dinosaurs in nests,
p29
aVthe first dinosaur embryos
p30
aVand massive accumulations of bones.
p31
aVAnd it happened to be at a time
p32
aVwhen people were just starting to begin to realize
p33
aVthat dinosaurs weren't the big, stupid, green reptiles
p34
aVthat people had thought for so many years.
p35
aVPeople were starting to get an idea
p36
aVthat dinosaurs were special.
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd so, at that time,
p39
aVI was able to make some interesting hypotheses
p40
aValong with my colleagues.
p41
aVWe were able to actually say
p42
aVthat dinosaurs \u2014 based on the evidence we had \u2014
p43
aVthat dinosaurs built nests
p44
aVand lived in colonies
p45
aVand cared for their young,
p46
aVbrought food to their babies
p47
aVand traveled in gigantic herds.
p48
aVSo it was pretty interesting stuff.
p49
aVI have gone on to find more things
p50
aVand discover that dinosaurs really were very social.
p51
aVWe have found a lot of evidence
p52
aVthat dinosaurs changed
p53
aVfrom when they were juveniles to when they were adults.
p54
aVThe appearance of them would have been different \u2014
p55
aVwhich it is in all social animals.
p56
aVIn social groups of animals,
p57
aVthe juveniles always look different than the adults.
p58
aVThe adults can recognize the juveniles;
p59
aVthe juveniles can recognize the adults.
p60
aVAnd so we're making a better picture
p61
aVof what a dinosaur looks like.
p62
aVAnd they didn't just all chase Jeeps around.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VBut it is that social thing
p67
aVthat I guess attracted Michael Crichton.
p68
aVAnd in his book, he talked about the social animals.
p69
aVAnd then Steven Spielberg, of course,
p70
aVdepicts these dinosaurs
p71
aVas being very social creatures.
p72
aVThe theme of this story is building a dinosaur,
p73
aVand so we come to that part of "Jurassic Park."
p74
aVMichael Crichton really was one of the first people
p75
aVto talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life.
p76
aVYou all know the story, right.
p77
aVI mean, I assume everyone here has seen "Jurassic Park."
p78
aa(lp79
VIf you want to make a dinosaur,
p80
aVyou go out, you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap \u2014
p81
aVotherwise known as amber \u2014
p82
aVthat has some blood-sucking insects in it,
p83
aVgood ones,
p84
aVand you get your insect and you drill into it
p85
aVand you suck out some DNA,
p86
aVbecause obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days
p87
aVsucked dinosaur DNA out.
p88
aVAnd you take your DNA back to the laboratory
p89
aVand you clone it.
p90
aVAnd I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg,
p91
aVor something like that,
p92
aVand then you wait,
p93
aVand, lo and behold, out pops a little baby dinosaur.
p94
aVAnd everybody's happy about that.
p95
aV(Laughter)
p96
aVAnd they're happy over and over again.
p97
aVThey keep doing it; they just keep making these things.
p98
aVAnd then, then, then, and then ...
p99
aVThen the dinosaurs, being social,
p100
aVact out their socialness,
p101
aVand they get together,
p102
aVand they conspire.
p103
aVAnd, of course, that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie \u2014
p104
aVconspiring dinosaurs chasing people around.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo I assume everybody knows
p107
aVthat if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it,
p108
aVand you drilled into it,
p109
aVand you got something out of that insect,
p110
aVand you cloned it, and you did it over and over and over again,
p111
aVyou'd have a room full of mosquitos.
p112
aV(Laughter)
p113
aV(Applause)
p114
aVAnd probably a whole bunch of trees as well.
p115
aa(lp116
VNow if you want dinosaur DNA,
p117
aVI say go to the dinosaur.
p118
aVSo that's what we've done.
p119
aVBack in 1993 when the movie came out,
p120
aVwe actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation
p121
aVto attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur,
p122
aVand we chose the dinosaur on the left,
p123
aVa Tyrannosaurus rex, which was a very nice specimen.
p124
aVAnd one of my former doctoral students,
p125
aVDr. Mary Schweitzer,
p126
aVactually had the background
p127
aVto do this sort of thing.
p128
aVAnd so she looked into the bone of this T. rex,
p129
aVone of the thigh bones,
p130
aVand she actually found
p131
aVsome very interesting structures in there.
p132
aVThey found these red circular-looking objects,
p133
aVand they looked, for all the world,
p134
aVlike red blood cells.
p135
aVAnd they're in
p136
aVwhat appear to be the blood channels
p137
aVthat go through the bone.
p138
aVAnd so she thought, well, what the heck.
p139
aVSo she sampled some material out of it.
p140
aVNow it wasn't DNA; she didn't find DNA.
p141
aVBut she did find heme,
p142
aVwhich is the biological foundation
p143
aVof hemoglobin.
p144
aVAnd that was really cool.
p145
aVThat was interesting.
p146
aVThat was \u2014 here we have 65-million-year-old heme.
p147
aVWell we tried and tried
p148
aVand we couldn't really get anything else out of it.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo a few years went by,
p151
aVand then we started the Hell Creek Project.
p152
aVAnd the Hell Creek Project was this massive undertaking
p153
aVto get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find,
p154
aVand hopefully find some dinosaurs
p155
aVthat had more material in them.
p156
aVAnd out in eastern Montana
p157
aVthere's a lot of space, a lot of badlands,
p158
aVand not very many people,
p159
aVand so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff.
p160
aVAnd we did find a lot of stuff.
p161
aVWe found a lot of Tyrannosaurs,
p162
aVbut we found one special Tyrannosaur,
p163
aVand we called it B-rex.
p164
aVAnd B-rex was found
p165
aVunder a thousand cubic yards of rock.
p166
aVIt wasn't a very complete T. rex,
p167
aVand it wasn't a very big T. rex,
p168
aVbut it was a very special B-rex.
p169
aVAnd I and my colleagues cut into it,
p170
aVand we were able to determine,
p171
aVby looking at lines of arrested growth, some lines in it,
p172
aVthat B-rex had died at the age of 16.
p173
aVWe don't really know how long dinosaurs lived,
p174
aVbecause we haven't found the oldest one yet.
p175
aVBut this one died at the age of 16.
p176
aa(lp177
VWe gave samples to Mary Schweitzer,
p178
aVand she was actually able to determine
p179
aVthat B-rex was a female
p180
aVbased on medullary tissue
p181
aVfound on the inside of the bone.
p182
aVMedullary tissue is the calcium build-up,
p183
aVthe calcium storage basically,
p184
aVwhen an animal is pregnant,
p185
aVwhen a bird is pregnant.
p186
aVSo here was the character
p187
aVthat linked birds and dinosaurs.
p188
aVBut Mary went further.
p189
aVShe took the bone, and she dumped it into acid.
p190
aVNow we all know that bones are fossilized,
p191
aVand so if you dump it into acid,
p192
aVthere shouldn't be anything left.
p193
aVBut there was something left.
p194
aVThere were blood vessels left.
p195
aVThere were flexible, clear blood vessels.
p196
aVAnd so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur.
p197
aVIt was extraordinary.
p198
aVBut she also found osteocytes,
p199
aVwhich are the cells that laid down the bones.
p200
aVAnd try and try, we could not find DNA,
p201
aVbut she did find evidence of proteins.
p202
aa(lp203
VBut we thought maybe \u2014
p204
aVwell, we thought maybe
p205
aVthat the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground.
p206
aVWe thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast.
p207
aVAnd so we built a laboratory
p208
aVin the back of an 18-wheeler trailer,
p209
aVand actually took the laboratory to the field
p210
aVwhere we could get better samples.
p211
aVAnd we did. We got better material.
p212
aVThe cells looked better.
p213
aVThe vessels looked better.
p214
aVFound the protein collagen.
p215
aVI mean, it was wonderful stuff.
p216
aVBut it's not dinosaur DNA.
p217
aVSo we have discovered
p218
aVthat dinosaur DNA, and all DNA,
p219
aVjust breaks down too fast.
p220
aVWe're just not going to be able
p221
aVto do what they did in "Jurassic Park."
p222
aVWe're not going to be able to make a dinosaur
p223
aVbased on a dinosaur.
p224
aa(lp225
VBut birds are dinosaurs.
p226
aVBirds are living dinosaurs.
p227
aVWe actually classify them
p228
aVas dinosaurs.
p229
aVWe now call them non-avian dinosaurs
p230
aVand avian dinosaurs.
p231
aVSo the non-avian dinosaurs
p232
aVare the big clunky ones that went extinct.
p233
aVAvian dinosaurs are our modern birds.
p234
aVSo we don't have to make a dinosaur
p235
aVbecause we already have them.
p236
aa(lp237
V(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
VI know, you're as bad as the sixth-graders.
p240
aV(Laughter)
p241
aVThe sixth-graders look at it and they say, "No."
p242
aV(Laughter)
p243
aV"You can call it a dinosaur,
p244
aVbut look at the velociraptor: the velociraptor is cool."
p245
aV(Laughter)
p246
aV"The chicken is not."
p247
aV(Laughter)
p248
aVSo this is our problem,
p249
aVas you can imagine.
p250
aVThe chicken is a dinosaur.
p251
aVI mean it really is.
p252
aVYou can't argue with it
p253
aVbecause we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way.
p254
aV(Laughter)
p255
aV(Applause)
p256
aVBut the sixth-graders demand it.
p257
aV"Fix the chicken."
p258
aV(Laughter)
p259
aVSo that's what I'm here to tell you about:
p260
aVhow we are going to fix a chicken.
p261
aa(lp262
VSo we have a number of ways
p263
aVthat we actually can fix the chicken.
p264
aVBecause evolution works,
p265
aVwe actually have some evolutionary tools.
p266
aVWe'll call them biological modification tools.
p267
aVWe have selection.
p268
aVAnd we know selection works.
p269
aVWe started out with a wolf-like creature
p270
aVand we ended up with a Maltese.
p271
aVI mean, that's \u2014
p272
aVthat's definitely genetic modification.
p273
aVOr any of the other funny-looking little dogs.
p274
aVWe also have transgenesis.
p275
aVTransgenesis is really cool too.
p276
aVThat's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one.
p277
aVThat's how people make GloFish.
p278
aVYou take a glow gene
p279
aVout of a coral or a jellyfish
p280
aVand you stick it in a zebrafish,
p281
aVand, puff, they glow.
p282
aVAnd that's pretty cool.
p283
aVAnd they obviously make a lot of money off of them.
p284
aVAnd now they're making Glow-rabbits
p285
aVand Glow-all-sorts-of-things.
p286
aVI guess we could make a glow chicken.
p287
aV(Laughter)
p288
aVBut I don't think that'll satisfy the sixth-graders either.
p289
aa(lp290
VBut there's another thing.
p291
aVThere's what we call atavism activation.
p292
aVAnd atavism activation
p293
aVis basically \u2014
p294
aVan atavism is an ancestral characteristic.
p295
aVYou heard
p296
aVthat occasionally children are born with tails,
p297
aVand it's because it's an ancestral characteristic.
p298
aVAnd so there are a number of atavisms
p299
aVthat can happen.
p300
aVSnakes are occasionally born with legs.
p301
aVAnd here's an example.
p302
aVThis is a chicken with teeth.
p303
aVA fellow by the name of Matthew Harris
p304
aVat the University of Wisconsin in Madison
p305
aVactually figured out a way to stimulate
p306
aVthe gene for teeth,
p307
aVand so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on
p308
aVand produce teeth in chickens.
p309
aVNow that's a good characteristic.
p310
aVWe can save that one.
p311
aVWe know we can use that.
p312
aVWe can make a chicken with teeth.
p313
aVThat's getting closer.
p314
aVThat's better than a glowing chicken.
p315
aa(lp316
V(Laughter)
p317
aa(lp318
VA friend of mine, a colleague of mine,
p319
aVDr. Hans Larsson at McGill University,
p320
aVis actually looking at atavisms.
p321
aVAnd he's looking at them
p322
aVby looking at the embryo genesis of birds
p323
aVand actually looking at how they develop,
p324
aVand he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail.
p325
aVHe's also interested in the transformation
p326
aVof the arm, the hand, to the wing.
p327
aVHe's looking for those genes as well.
p328
aVAnd I said, "Well, if you can find those,
p329
aVI can just reverse them
p330
aVand make what I need to make for the sixth-graders."
p331
aVAnd so he agreed.
p332
aVAnd so that's what we're looking into.
p333
aa(lp334
VIf you look at dinosaur hands,
p335
aVa velociraptor
p336
aVhas that cool-looking hand with the claws on it.
p337
aVArchaeopteryx, which is a bird, a primitive bird,
p338
aVstill has that very primitive hand.
p339
aVBut as you can see, the pigeon,
p340
aVor a chicken or anything else, another bird,
p341
aVhas kind of a weird-looking hand,
p342
aVbecause the hand is a wing.
p343
aVBut the cool thing is
p344
aVthat, if you look in the embryo,
p345
aVas the embryo is developing
p346
aVthe hand actually looks
p347
aVpretty much like the archaeopteryx hand.
p348
aVIt has the three fingers, the three digits.
p349
aVBut a gene turns on that actually fuses those together.
p350
aVAnd so what we're looking for is that gene.
p351
aVWe want to stop that gene from turning on,
p352
aVfusing those hands together,
p353
aVso we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand,
p354
aVlike the archaeopteryx.
p355
aVAnd the same goes for the tails.
p356
aVBirds have basically
p357
aVrudimentary tails.
p358
aVAnd so we know
p359
aVthat in embryo,
p360
aVas the animal is developing,
p361
aVit actually has a relatively long tail.
p362
aVBut a gene turns on
p363
aVand resorbs the tail, gets rid of it.
p364
aVSo that's the other gene we're looking for.
p365
aVWe want to stop that tail from resorbing.
p366
aa(lp367
VSo what we're trying to do really
p368
aVis take our chicken,
p369
aVmodify it
p370
aVand make the chickenosaurus.
p371
aV(Laughter)
p372
aVIt's a cooler-looking chicken.
p373
aVBut it's just the very basics.
p374
aVSo that really is what we're doing.
p375
aVAnd people always say, "Why do that?
p376
aVWhy make this thing?
p377
aVWhat good is it?"
p378
aVWell, that's a good question.
p379
aVActually, I think it's a great way to teach kids
p380
aVabout evolutionary biology
p381
aVand developmental biology
p382
aVand all sorts of things.
p383
aVAnd quite frankly, I think
p384
aVif Colonel Sanders
p385
aVwas to be careful how he worded it,
p386
aVhe could actually advertise an extra piece.
p387
aV(Laughter)
p388
aa(lp389
VAnyway \u2014
p390
aVWhen our dino-chicken hatches,
p391
aVit will be, obviously, the poster child,
p392
aVor what you might call a poster chick,
p393
aVfor technology, entertainment and design.
p394
aa(lp395
VThank you.

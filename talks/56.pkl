VWalk around for four months with three wishes,
p5
aVand all the ideas will start to percolate up.
p6
aVI think everybody should do it \u2014 think that you've got three wishes.
p7
aVAnd what would you do? It's actually a great exercise
p8
aVto really drill down to the things that you feel are important,
p9
aVand really reflect on the world around us.
p10
aVAnd thinking that, can an individual actually do something,
p11
aVor come up with something,
p12
aVthat may actually get some traction out there and make a difference?
p13
aVInspired by nature \u2014 that's the theme here.
p14
aVAnd I think, quite frankly, that's where I started.
p15
aa(lp16
VI became very interested in the landscape as a Canadian.
p17
aVWe have this Great North. And there was a pretty small population,
p18
aVand my father was an avid outdoorsman.
p19
aVSo I really had a chance to experience that.
p20
aVAnd I could never really understand exactly what it was, or how it was informing me.
p21
aVBut what I think it was telling me
p22
aVis that we are this transient thing that's happening,
p23
aVand that the nature that you see out there \u2014 the untouched shorelines,
p24
aVthe untouched forest that I was able to see \u2014
p25
aVreally bring in a sense of that geological time,
p26
aVthat this has gone on for a long time,
p27
aVand we're experiencing it in a different way.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd that, to me, was a reference point that I think I needed to have
p30
aVto be able to make the work that I did.
p31
aVAnd I did go out, and I did this picture of grasses coming through in the spring,
p32
aValong a roadside.
p33
aVThis rebirth of grass. And then I went out for years
p34
aVtrying to photograph the pristine landscape.
p35
aVBut as a fine-art photographer I somehow felt
p36
aVthat it wouldn't catch on out there,
p37
aVthat there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fine-art career.
p38
aVAnd I kept being sucked into this genre of the calendar picture,
p39
aVor something of that nature, and I couldn't get away from it.
p40
aVSo I started to think of, how can I rethink the landscape?
p41
aVI decided to rethink the landscape
p42
aVas the landscape that we've transformed.
p43
aa(lp44
VI had a bit of an epiphany being lost in Pennsylvania,
p45
aVand I took a left turn trying to get back to the highway.
p46
aVAnd I ended up in a town called Frackville.
p47
aVI got out of the car, and I stood up,
p48
aVand it was a coal-mining town. I did a 360 turnaround,
p49
aVand that became one of the most surreal landscapes I've ever seen.
p50
aVTotally transformed by man.
p51
aVAnd that got me to go out and look at mines like this,
p52
aVand go out and look at the largest industrial incursions
p53
aVin the landscape that I could find.
p54
aVAnd that became the baseline of what I was doing.
p55
aVAnd it also became the theme that I felt that I could hold onto,
p56
aVand not have to re-invent myself \u2014
p57
aVthat this theme was large enough to become a life's work,
p58
aVto become something that I could sink my teeth into
p59
aVand just research and find out where these industries are.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd I think one of the things I also wanted to say in my thanks,
p62
aVwhich I kind of missed,
p63
aVwas to thank all the corporations who helped me get in.
p64
aVBecause it took negotiation for almost every one of these photographs \u2014
p65
aVto get into that place to make those photographs,
p66
aVand if it wasn't for those people letting me in
p67
aVat the heads of those corporations,
p68
aVI would have never made this body of work.
p69
aVSo in that respect, to me, I'm not against the corporation.
p70
aVI own a corporation. I work with them,
p71
aVand I feel that we all need them and they're important.
p72
aVBut I am also for sustainability.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo there's this thing that is pulling me in both directions.
p75
aVAnd I'm not making an indictment towards what's happening here,
p76
aVbut it is a slow progression.
p77
aVSo I started thinking, well, we live in all these ages of man:
p78
aVthe Stone Age, and the Iron Age, and the Copper Age.
p79
aVAnd these ages of man are still at work today.
p80
aVBut we've become totally disconnected from them.
p81
aVThere's something that we're not seeing there.
p82
aVAnd it's a scary thing as well. Because when we start looking
p83
aVat the collective appetite for our lifestyles,
p84
aVand what we're doing to that landscape \u2014
p85
aVthat, to me, is something that is a very sobering moment for me to contemplate.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd through my photographs,
p88
aVI'm hoping to be able to engage the audiences of my work,
p89
aVand to come up to it and not immediately be rejected by the image.
p90
aVNot to say, "Oh my God, what is it?" but to be challenged by it \u2014
p91
aVto say, "Wow, this is beautiful," on one level,
p92
aVbut on the other level, "This is scary. I shouldn't be enjoying it."
p93
aVLike a forbidden pleasure. And it's that forbidden pleasure
p94
aVthat I think is what resonates out there,
p95
aVand it gets people to look at these things,
p96
aVand it gets people to enter it. And it also, in a way, defines kind of what I feel, too \u2014
p97
aVthat I'm drawn to have a good life.
p98
aVI want a house, and I want a car.
p99
aVBut there's this consequence out there.
p100
aVAnd how do I begin to have that attraction, repulsion?
p101
aVIt's even in my own conscience I'm having it,
p102
aVand here in my work, I'm trying to build that same toggle.
p103
aa(lp104
VThese things that I photographed \u2014 this tire pile here
p105
aVhad 45 million tires in it. It was the largest one.
p106
aVIt was only about an hour-and-a-half away from me, and it caught fire
p107
aVabout four years ago. It's around Westley, California, around Modesto.
p108
aVAnd I decided to start looking at something that, to me, had \u2014
p109
aVif the earlier work of looking at the landscape
p110
aVhad a sense of lament to what we were doing to nature,
p111
aVin the recycling work that you're seeing here
p112
aVwas starting to point to a direction. To me, it was our redemption.
p113
aVThat in the recycling work that I was doing,
p114
aVI'm looking for a practice, a human activity that is sustainable.
p115
aVThat if we keep putting things, through industrial and urban existence,
p116
aVback into the system \u2014
p117
aVif we keep doing that \u2014 we can continue on.
p118
aVOf course, listening at the conference,
p119
aVthere's many, many things that are coming. Bio-mimicry,
p120
aVand there's many other things that are coming on stream \u2014
p121
aVnanotechnology that may also prevent us from having
p122
aVto go into that landscape and tear it apart.
p123
aVAnd we all look forward to those things.
p124
aa(lp125
VBut in the meantime, these things are scaling up.
p126
aVThese things are continuing to happen.
p127
aVWhat you're looking at here \u2014 I went to Bangladesh,
p128
aVso I started to move away from North America;
p129
aVI started to look at our world globally.
p130
aVThese images of Bangladesh
p131
aVcame out of a radio program I was listening to.
p132
aVThey were talking about Exxon Valdez,
p133
aVand that there was going to be a glut of oil tankers
p134
aVbecause of the insurance industries.
p135
aVAnd that those oil tankers needed to be decommissioned,
p136
aVand 2004 was going to be the pinnacle.
p137
aVAnd I thought, "My God, wouldn't that be something?"
p138
aVTo see the largest vessels of man being deconstructed by hand,
p139
aVliterally, in third-world countries.
p140
aVSo originally I was going to go to India.
p141
aVAnd I was shut out of India because of a Greenpeace situation there,
p142
aVand then I was able to get into Bangladesh,
p143
aVand saw for the first time a third world, a view of it,
p144
aVthat I had never actually thought was possible.
p145
aV130 million people living in an area the size of Wisconsin \u2014
p146
aVpeople everywhere \u2014 the pollution was intense,
p147
aVand the working conditions were horrible.
p148
aa(lp149
VHere you're looking at some oil fields in California,
p150
aVsome of the biggest oil fields. And again, I started to think that \u2014
p151
aVthere was another epiphany \u2014
p152
aVthat the whole world I was living in was
p153
aVa result of having plentiful oil.
p154
aVAnd that, to me, was again something that I started building on,
p155
aVand I continued to build on.
p156
aVSo this is a series I'm hoping to have ready
p157
aVin about two or three years,
p158
aVunder the heading of "The Oil Party."
p159
aVBecause I think everything that we're involved in \u2014
p160
aVour clothing, our cars, our roads, and everything \u2014 are directly a result.
p161
aVI'm going to move to some pictures of China.
p162
aVAnd for me China \u2014 I started photographing it four years ago,
p163
aVand China truly is a question of sustainability in my mind,
p164
aa(lp165
Vnot to mention that China, as well,
p166
aVhas a great effect on the industries that I grew up around.
p167
aVI came out of a blue-collar town,
p168
aVa GM town, and my father worked at GM,
p169
aVso I was very familiar with that kind of industry
p170
aVand that also informed my work. But you know,
p171
aVto see China and the scale at which it's evolving, is quite something.
p172
aVSo what you see here is the Three Gorges Dam,
p173
aVand this is the largest dam by 50 percent ever attempted by man.
p174
aVMost of the engineers around the world left the project
p175
aVbecause they said, "It's just too big."
p176
aVIn fact, when it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago,
p177
aVthey were able to measure a wobble within the earth as it was spinning.
p178
aVIt took fifteen days to fill it.
p179
aVSo this created a reservoir 600 kilometers long,
p180
aVone of the largest reservoirs ever created.
p181
aVAnd what was also one of the bigger projects around that
p182
aVwas moving 13 full-size cities up out of the reservoir,
p183
aVand flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships.
p184
aa(lp185
VThis is a "before and after." So that was before.
p186
aVAnd this is like 10 weeks later, demolished by hand.
p187
aVI think 11 of the buildings they used dynamite,
p188
aVeverything else was by hand. That was 10 weeks later.
p189
aVAnd this gives you an idea.
p190
aVAnd it was all the people who lived in those homes,
p191
aVwere the ones that were actually taking it apart
p192
aVand working, and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart.
p193
aVAnd these are some of the images from that.
p194
aVSo I spent about three trips to the Three Gorges Dam,
p195
aVlooking at that massive transformation of a landscape.
p196
aVAnd it looks like a bombed-out landscape, but it isn't.
p197
aVWhat it is, it's a landscape that is an intentional one.
p198
aVThis is a need for power, and they're willing to go through this
p199
aVmassive transformation, on this scale, to get that power.
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd again, it's actually a relief for what's going on in China
p202
aVbecause I think on the table right now,
p203
aVthere's 27 nuclear power stations to be built.
p204
aVThere hasn't been one built in North America for 20 years
p205
aVbecause of the "NIMBY" problem \u2014 "Not In My BackYard."
p206
aVBut in China they're saying, "No, we're putting in 27 in the next 10 years."
p207
aVAnd coal-burning furnaces are going in there
p208
aVfor hydroelectric power literally weekly.
p209
aVSo coal itself is probably one of the largest problems.
p210
aVAnd one of the other things that happened in the Three Gorges \u2014
p211
aVa lot of the agricultural land that you see there on the left was also lost;
p212
aVsome of the most fertile agricultural land was lost in that.
p213
aVAnd 1.2 to 2 million people were relocated,
p214
aVdepending on whose statistics you're looking at.
p215
aVAnd this is what they were building.
p216
aa(lp217
VThis is Wushan, one of the largest cities that was relocated.
p218
aVThis is the town hall for the city.
p219
aVAnd again, the rebuilding of the city \u2014 to me, it was sad to see
p220
aVthat they didn't really grab a lot of, I guess,
p221
aVwhat we know here, in terms of urban planning.
p222
aVThere were no parks; there were no green spaces.
p223
aVVery high-density living on the side of a hill.
p224
aVAnd here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up,
p225
aVbut somehow were not connecting with them.
p226
aa(lp227
VHere is a sign that, translated, says, "Obey the birth control law.
p228
aVBuild our science, civilized and advanced idea of marriage and giving birth."
p229
aVSo here, if you look at this poster,
p230
aVit has all the trappings of Western culture.
p231
aVYou're seeing the tuxedos, the bouquets.
p232
aVBut what's really, to me, frightening about the picture
p233
aVand about this billboard is the refinery in the background.
p234
aVSo it's like marrying up all the things that we have
p235
aVand it's an adaptation of our way of life, full stop.
p236
aVAnd again, when you start seeing that kind of embrace,
p237
aVand you start looking at them leading their rural lifestyle
p238
aVwith a very, very small footprint and moving into an urban lifestyle
p239
aVwith a much higher footprint, it starts to become very sobering.
p240
aa(lp241
VThis is a shot in one of the biggest squares in Guangdong \u2014
p242
aVand this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country.
p243
aVAnd there's about 130 million people in migration
p244
aVtrying to get into urban centers at all times,
p245
aVand in the next 10 to 15 years, are expecting
p246
aVanother 400 to 500 million people to migrate
p247
aVinto the urban centers like Shanghai and the manufacturing centers.
p248
aVThe manufacturers are \u2014
p249
aVthe domestics are usually \u2014 you can tell a domestic factory by the fact
p250
aVthat they all use the same color uniforms.
p251
aVSo this is a pink uniform at this factory. It's a shoe factory.
p252
aVAnd they have dorms for the workers.
p253
aVSo they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms.
p254
aa(lp255
VThis is one of the biggest shoe factories, the Yuyuan shoe factory
p256
aVnear Shenzhen. It has 90,000 employees making shoes.
p257
aVThis is a shift change, one of three.
p258
aVThere's two factories of this scale in the same town.
p259
aVThis is one with 45,000, so every lunch,
p260
aVthere's about 12,000 coming through for lunch.
p261
aVThey sit down; they have about 20 minutes.
p262
aVThe next round comes in. It's an incredible workforce
p263
aVthat's building there. Shanghai \u2014
p264
aVI'm looking at the urban renewal in Shanghai,
p265
aVand this is a whole area that will be flattened
p266
aVand turned into skyscrapers in the next five years.
p267
aa(lp268
VWhat's also happening in Shanghai is \u2014
p269
aVChina is changing because this wouldn't have happened
p270
aVfive years ago, for instance. This is a holdout.
p271
aVThey're called dengzahoos \u2014 they're like pin tacks to the ground.
p272
aVThey won't move. They're not negotiating.
p273
aVThey're not getting enough, so they're not going to move.
p274
aVAnd so they're holding off until they get a deal with them.
p275
aVAnd they've been actually quite successful in getting better deals
p276
aVbecause most of them are getting a raw deal.
p277
aVThey're being put out about two hours \u2014
p278
aVthe communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years,
p279
aVor maybe even thousands of years,
p280
aVare being broken up and spread across in the suburban areas
p281
aVoutside of Shanghai. But these are a whole series of guys
p282
aVholding out in this reconstruction of Shanghai.
p283
aVProbably the largest urban-renewal project, I think,
p284
aVever attempted on the planet.
p285
aa(lp286
VAnd then the embrace of the things that they're replacing it with \u2014
p287
aVagain, one of my wishes, and I never ended up going there,
p288
aVwas to somehow tell them that there were better ways to build a house.
p289
aVThe kinds of collisions of styles and things were quite something,
p290
aVand these are called the villas.
p291
aVAnd also, like right now, they're just moving.
p292
aVThe scaffolding is still on, and this is an e-waste area,
p293
aVand if you looked in the foreground on the big print,
p294
aVyou'd see that the industry \u2014 their industry \u2014 they're all recycling.
p295
aVSo the industry's already growing
p296
aVaround these new developments.
p297
aa(lp298
VThis is a five-level bridge in Shanghai.
p299
aVShanghai was a very intriguing city \u2014 it's exploding on a level
p300
aVthat I don't think any city has experienced.
p301
aVIn fact, even Shenzhen, the economic zone \u2014
p302
aVone of the first ones \u2014 15 years ago was about 100,000 people,
p303
aVand today it boasts about 10 to 11 million.
p304
aVSo that gives you an idea of the kinds of migrations and the speed with which \u2014
p305
aVthis is just the taxis being built by Volkswagen.
p306
aVThere's 9,000 of them here,
p307
aVand they're being built for most of the big cities,
p308
aVBeijing and Shanghai, Shenzhen.
p309
aVAnd this isn't even the domestic car market; this is the taxi market.
p310
aVAnd what we would see here as a suburban development \u2014
p311
aVa similar thing, but they're all high-rises.
p312
aVSo they'll put 20 or 40 up at a time,
p313
aVand they just go up in the same way
p314
aVas a single-family dwelling would go up here in an area.
p315
aa(lp316
VAnd the density is quite incredible.
p317
aVAnd one of the things in this picture that I wanted to point out
p318
aVis that when I saw these kinds of buildings,
p319
aVI was shocked to see
p320
aVthat they're not using a central air-conditioning system;
p321
aVevery window has an air conditioner in it.
p322
aVAnd I'm sure there are people here who probably
p323
aVknow better than I do about efficiencies,
p324
aVbut I can't imagine that every apartment having its own air conditioner
p325
aVis a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale.
p326
aVAnd when you start looking at that,
p327
aVand then you start factoring up into a city the size of Shanghai,
p328
aVit's literally a forest of skyscrapers.
p329
aVIt's breathtaking, in terms of the speed at which this city is transforming.
p330
aVAnd you can see in the foreground of this picture,
p331
aVit's still one of the last areas that was being held up.
p332
aVRight now that's all cleared out \u2014 this was done about eight months ago \u2014
p333
aVand high-rises are now going up into that central spot.
p334
aVSo a skyscraper is built, literally, overnight in Shanghai.
p335
aa(lp336
VMost recently I went in, and I started looking
p337
aVat some of the biggest industries in China.
p338
aVAnd this is Baosteel, right outside of Shanghai.
p339
aVThis is the coal supply for the steel factory \u2014 18 square kilometers.
p340
aVIt's an incredibly massive operation, I think 15,000 workers,
p341
aVfive cupolas, and the sixth one's coming in here.
p342
aVSo they're building very large blast furnaces
p343
aVto try to deal with the demand for steel in China.
p344
aVSo this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot.
p345
aVAnd again, looking at these images, there's this constant, like, haze that you're seeing.
p346
aVThis is going to show you, real time, an assembler. It's a circuit breaker.
p347
aV10 hours a day at this speed.
p348
aVI think one of the issues
p349
aVthat we here are facing with China,
p350
aVis that they're using a lot of the latest production technology.
p351
aa(lp352
VIn that one, there were 400 people that worked on the floor.
p353
aVAnd I asked the manager to point out five of your fastest producers,
p354
aVand then I went and looked at each one of them for about 15 or 20 minutes,
p355
aVand picked this one woman.
p356
aVAnd it was just lightning fast;
p357
aVthe way she was working was almost unbelievable.
p358
aVBut that is the trick that they've got right now,
p359
aVthat they're winning with, is that they're using
p360
aVall the latest technologies and extrusion machines,
p361
aVand bringing all the components into play,
p362
aVbut the assembly is where they're actually bringing in \u2014
p363
aVthe country workers are very willing to work. They want to work.
p364
aVThere's a massive backlog of people wanting their jobs.
p365
aVThat condition's going to be there for the next 10 to 15 years
p366
aVif they realize what they want, which is, you know,
p367
aV400 to 500 million more people coming into the cities.
p368
aa(lp369
VIn this particular case \u2014 this is the assembly line that you saw;
p370
aVthis is a shot of it.
p371
aVI had to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field.
p372
aVI had to have them freeze for 10 seconds to get this shot.
p373
aVIt took me five fake tries
p374
aVbecause they were just going. To slow them down was literally impossible.
p375
aVThey were just wound up doing these things all day long,
p376
aVuntil the manager had to, with a stern voice, say,
p377
aV"Okay, everybody freeze."
p378
aVIt wasn't too bad,
p379
aVbut they're driven to produce these things at an incredible rate.
p380
aa(lp381
VThis is a textile mill doing synthetic silk, an oil byproduct.
p382
aVAnd what you're seeing here is,
p383
aVagain, one of the most state-of-the-art textile mills.
p384
aVThere are 500 of these machines; they're worth about 200,000 dollars each.
p385
aVSo you have about 12 people running this,
p386
aVand they're just inspecting it \u2014 and they're just walking the lines.
p387
aVThe machines are all running,
p388
aVabsolutely incredible to see what the scale of industries are.
p389
aVAnd I started getting in further and further into the factories.
p390
aVAnd that's a diptych. I do a lot of pairings
p391
aVto try and get the sense of scale in these places.
p392
aVThis is a line where they get the threads
p393
aVand they wind the threads together,
p394
aVpre-going into the textile mills.
p395
aa(lp396
VHere's something that's far more labor-intensive,
p397
aVwhich is the making of shoes.
p398
aVThis floor has about 1,500 workers on this floor.
p399
aVThe company itself had about 10,000 employees,
p400
aVand they're doing domestic shoes.
p401
aVIt was very hard to get into the international companies
p402
aVbecause I had to get permission from companies like Nike and Adidas,
p403
aVand that's very hard to get.
p404
aVAnd they don't want to let me in.
p405
aVBut the domestic was much easier to do.
p406
aVIt just gives you a sense of, again \u2014 and that's where,
p407
aVreally, the whole migration of jobs started going over to China
p408
aVand making the shoes. Nike was one of the early ones.
p409
aVIt was such a high labor component to it
p410
aVthat it made a lot of sense to go after that labor market.
p411
aa(lp412
VThis is a high-tech mobile phone: Bird mobile phone,
p413
aVone of the largest mobile makers in China.
p414
aVI think mobile phone companies
p415
aVare popping up, literally, on a weekly basis,
p416
aVand they have an explosive growth in mobile phones.
p417
aVThis is a textile where they're doing shirts \u2014
p418
aVYoungor, the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in China.
p419
aVAnd this next shot here is one of the lunchrooms.
p420
aVEverything is very efficient.
p421
aVWhile setting up this shot,
p422
aVpeople on average would spend eight to 10 minutes having a lunch.
p423
aVThis was one of the biggest factories I've ever seen.
p424
aVThey make coffeemakers here, the biggest coffeemaker
p425
aVand the biggest iron makers \u2014
p426
aVthey make 20 million of them in the world.
p427
aVThere's 21,000 employees. This one factory \u2014 and they had several of them \u2014
p428
aVis half a kilometer long.
p429
aVThese are just recently shot \u2014 I just came back about a month ago,
p430
aVso you're the first ones to be seeing these,
p431
aVthese new factory pictures I've taken.
p432
aa(lp433
VSo it's taken me almost a year to gain access into these places.
p434
aVThe other aspect of what's happening in China
p435
aVis that there's a real need for materials there.
p436
aVSo a lot of the recycled materials that are collected here
p437
aVare being recycled and taken to China by ships.
p438
aVThat's cubed metal. This is armatures, electrical armatures,
p439
aVwhere they're getting the copper and the high-end steel
p440
aVfrom electrical motors out, and recycling them.
p441
aVThis is certainly connected to California and Silicon Valley.
p442
aVBut this is what happens to most of the computers.
p443
aVFifty percent of the world's computers end up in China to be recycled.
p444
aa(lp445
VIt's referred to as "e-waste" there.
p446
aVAnd it is a bit of a problem. The way they recycle the boards
p447
aVis that they actually use the coal briquettes,
p448
aVwhich are used all through China, but they heat up the boards,
p449
aVand with pairs of pliers they pull off all the components.
p450
aVThey're trying to get all the valued metals out of those components.
p451
aVBut the toxic smells \u2014 when you come into a town
p452
aVthat's actually doing this kind of burning of the boards,
p453
aVyou can smell it a good five or 10 kilometers before you get there.
p454
aVHere's another operation. It's all cottage industries,
p455
aVso it's not big places \u2014 it's all in people's front porches,
p456
aVin their backyards, even in their homes they're burning boards,
p457
aa(lp458
Vif there's a concern for somebody coming by \u2014
p459
aVbecause it is considered in China to be illegal, doing it,
p460
aVbut they can't stop the product from coming in.
p461
aVThis portrait \u2014 I'm not usually known for portraits,
p462
aVbut I couldn't resist this one, where she's been through Mao,
p463
aVand she's been through the Great Leap Forward,
p464
aVand the Cultural Revolution, and now she's sitting on her porch
p465
aVwith this e-waste beside her. It's quite something.
p466
aVThis is a road where it's been shored up by computer boards
p467
aVin one of the biggest towns where they're recycling.
p468
aVSo that's the photographs that I wanted to show you.
p469
aa(lp470
V(Applause)
p471
aa(lp472
VI want to dedicate my wishes to my two girls.
p473
aVThey've been sitting on my shoulder the whole time while I've been thinking.
p474
aVOne's Megan, the one of the right, and Katja there.
p475
aVAnd to me the whole notion \u2014
p476
aVthe things I'm photographing are out of a great concern
p477
aVabout the scale of our progress and what we call progress.
p478
aVAnd as much as there are great things around the corner \u2014
p479
aVand it's palpable in this room \u2014
p480
aVof all of the things that are just about to break
p481
aVthat can solve so many problems,
p482
aVI'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world
p483
aVand will start to have a positive effect.
p484
aVAnd it isn't something that isn't just affecting our world,
p485
aVbut it starts to go up \u2014 because I think we can start correcting
p486
aVour footprint and bring it down \u2014 but there's a growing footprint
p487
aVthat's happening in Asia, and is growing at a rapid, rapid rate,
p488
aVand so I don't think we can equalize it. So ultimately the strategy,
p489
aVI think, here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution,
p490
aVbecause it is going to be connected to our evolution as well.
p491
aa(lp492
VSo part of my thinking, and part of my wishes,
p493
aVis sitting with these thoughts in mind,
p494
aVand thinking about,
p495
aV"How is their life going to be when they want to have children,
p496
aVor when they're ready to get married 20 years from now \u2014 or whatever,
p497
aV15 years from now?"
p498
aVAnd to me that has been the core behind most of my thinking \u2014
p499
aVin my work, and also for this incredible chance to have some wishes.
p500
aVWish one: world-changing. I want to use my images
p501
aVto persuade millions of people to join in the global conversation on sustainability.
p502
aVAnd it is through communications today
p503
aVthat I believe that that is not an unreal idea.
p504
aVOh, and I went in search \u2014 I wanted to put what I had in mind,
p505
aVhitch it onto something. I didn't want a wish just to start from nowhere.
p506
aa(lp507
VOne of them I'm starting from almost nothing, but the other one,
p508
aVI wanted to find out what's going on that's working right now.
p509
aVAnd Worldchanging.com is a fantastic blog, and that blog
p510
aVis now being visited by close to half-a-million people a month.
p511
aVAnd it just started about 14 months ago.
p512
aVAnd the beauty of what's going on there
p513
aVis that the tone of the conversation is the tone that I like.
p514
aVWhat they're doing there is that they're not \u2014
p515
aVI think the environmental movement has failed
p516
aVin that it's used the stick too much;
p517
aVit's used the apocalyptic tone too much;
p518
aVit hasn't sold the positive aspects of
p519
aVbeing environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out.
p520
aVWhereas this conversation that is going on in this blog
p521
aVis about positive movements,
p522
aVabout how to change our world in a better way, quickly.
p523
aVAnd it's looking at technology, and it's looking at new energy-saving devices,
p524
aVand it's looking at how to rethink and how to re-strategize
p525
aVthe movement towards sustainability.
p526
aa(lp527
VAnd so for me, one of the things that I thought
p528
aVwould be to put some of my work in the service of promoting
p529
aVthe Worldchanging.com website.
p530
aVSome of you might know, he's a TEDster \u2014 Stephen Sagmeister and I
p531
aVare working on some layouts. And this is still in preliminary stages;
p532
aVthese aren't the finals. But these images, with Worldchanging.com,
p533
aVcan be placed into any kind of media.
p534
aVThey could be posted through the Web;
p535
aVthey could be used as a billboard or a bus shelter, or anything of that nature.
p536
aVSo we're looking at this as trying to build out.
p537
aVAnd what we ended up discussing
p538
aVwas that in most media you get mostly an image with a lot of text,
p539
aVand the text is blasted all over.
p540
aa(lp541
VWhat was unusual, according to Stephen,
p542
aVis less than five percent of ads are actually leading with image.
p543
aVAnd so in this case,
p544
aVbecause it's about a lot of these images and what they represent,
p545
aVand the kinds of questions they bring up,
p546
aVthat we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say,
p547
aV"Well, what's Worldchanging.com, with these images, have to do?"
p548
aVAnd hopefully inspire people to go to that website.
p549
aVSo Worldchanging.com, and building that blog, and it is a blog,
p550
aVand I'm hoping that it isn't \u2014 I don't see it as the kind of blog
p551
aVwhere we're all going to follow each other to death.
p552
aVThis one is one that will spoke out, and will go out,
p553
aVand to start reaching. Because right now there's conversations
p554
aVin India, in China, in South America \u2014
p555
aVthere's entries coming from all around the world.
p556
aVI think there's a chance to have a dialogue, a conversation
p557
aVabout sustainability at Worldchanging.com.
p558
aVAnd anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic.
p559
aa(lp560
VWish two is more of the bottom-up, ground-up one that I'm trying to work with.
p561
aVAnd this one is: I wish to launch a groundbreaking competition
p562
aVthat motivates kids to invest ideas on, and invent ideas on, sustainability.
p563
aVAnd one of the things that came out \u2014
p564
aVAllison, who actually nominated me, said something earlier on
p565
aVin a brainstorming. She said that recycling in Canada
p566
aVhad a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six.
p567
aVAnd you think about it, you know,
p568
aVgrade four \u2014 my wife and I, we say age seven is the age of reason,
p569
aVso they're into the age of reason. And they're pre-puberty.
p570
aVSo it's this great window where they actually are \u2014
p571
aVyou can influence them. You know what happens at puberty?
p572
aVYou know, we know that from earlier presentations.
p573
aa(lp574
VSo my thinking here is that we try to motivate those kids
p575
aVto start driving home ideas. Let them understand what sustainability is,
p576
aVand that they have a vested interest in it to happen.
p577
aVAnd one of the ways I thought of doing it is to use my prize,
p578
aVso I would take 30,000 or 40,000 dollars of the winnings,
p579
aVand the rest is going to be to manage this project,
p580
aVbut to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands.
p581
aVBut the other thing that I thought would be fantastic
p582
aVwas to create these \u2014 call them "prize targets."
p583
aVAnd so one could be for the best sustainable idea
p584
aVfor an in-school project, the best one for a household project,
p585
aVor it could be the best community project for sustainability.
p586
aa(lp587
VAnd I also thought there should be a nice prize
p588
aVfor the best artwork for "In My World." And what would happen \u2014
p589
aVit's a scalable thing. And if we can get people to put in things \u2014
p590
aVwhether it's equipment, like a media lab,
p591
aVor money to make the prize significant enough \u2014
p592
aVand to open it up to all the schools that are public schools,
p593
aVor schools that are with kids that age,
p594
aVand make it a wide-open competition for them
p595
aVto go after those prizes and to submit them.
p596
aVAnd the prize has to be a verifiable thing, so it's not about just ideas.
p597
aVThe art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them
p598
aVand do them, but the actual things have to be verifiable.
p599
aVIn that way, what's happening is that
p600
aVwe're motivating a certain age group to start thinking.
p601
aVAnd they're going to push that up, from the bottom \u2014 up into,
p602
aVI believe, into the households. And parents will be reacting to it,
p603
aVand trying to help them with the projects.
p604
aa(lp605
VAnd I think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability
p606
aVin a very positive way,
p607
aVand starts to teach them. They know about recycling now,
p608
aVbut they don't really, I think, get sustainability in all the things,
p609
aVand the energy footprint, and how that matters.
p610
aVAnd to teach them, to me, would be a fantastic wish,
p611
aVand it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into.
p612
aVAnd again, in "In My World," the competition \u2014
p613
aVwe would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it.
p614
aVAnd I like the words, "in my world,"
p615
aVbecause it gives possession of the world to the person who's doing it.
p616
aVIt is my world; it's not someone else's. I want to help it;
p617
aVI want to do something with it. So I think it has a great opportunity
p618
aVto engage the imaginations \u2014 and great ideas, I think, come from kids \u2014
p619
aVand engage their imagination into a project,
p620
aVand do something for schools.
p621
aVI think all schools could use extra equipment, extra cash \u2014
p622
aVit's going to be an incentive for them to do that.
p623
aVAnd these are some of the ideas in terms of where
p624
aVwe could possibly put in some promotion for "In My World."
p625
aa(lp626
VAnd wish three is: Imax film. So I was told I should do one for myself,
p627
aVand I've always wanted to actually get involved with doing something.
p628
aVAnd the scale of my work, and the kinds of ideas I'm playing with \u2014
p629
aVwhen I first saw an Imax film, I almost immediately thought,
p630
aV"There's a real resonance between what I'm trying to do
p631
aVand the scale of what I try to do as a photographer."
p632
aVAnd I think there's a real possibility
p633
aVto reach new audiences if I had a chance.
p634
aVSo I'm looking, really, for a mentor, because I just had my birthday.
p635
aVI'm 50, and I don't have time to go back to school right now \u2014
p636
aVI'm too busy. So I need somebody
p637
aVwho can put me on a quick catch-up course on how to do something like that,
p638
aVand lead me through the maze of how one does something like this.
p639
aVThat would be fantastic. So those are my three wishes.

Burtynsky&#39;s large-format color photographs explore the impact of humanity&#39;s expanding footprint and the substantial ways in which we&#39;re reshaping the surface of the planet. His images powerfully alter the way we think about the world and our place in it. </p><p>With his blessing and encouragement, <a href=\\"http://www.worldchanging.com/archives//006356.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" title=\\"WorldChanging.com\\">WorldChanging.com</a>  and others use his work to inspire ongoing global conversations about sustainable living. Burtynsky&#39;s photographs are included in the collections of over 50 museums around the world, including the Tate, London and the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim in New York City. A large-format book, 2003&#39;s <a href=\\"http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=0300099436\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Manufactured Landscapes,</em></a> collected his work, and in 2007, a documentary based on his photography, also called <em><a href=\\"http://geni.us/manulandscapesdoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Manufactured Landscapes</a>,</em> debuted at the Toronto Film Festival before going on to screen at Sundance and elsewhere. It was released on DVD in March 2007. In 2008, after giving a talk at the&nbsp;Long Now Foundation, Burtynsky proposed &quot;The 10,000 Year Gallery,&quot; which could house art to be curated over thousands of years preserved through carbon transfers in an effort to reflect the attitudes and changes of the world over time.&nbsp;</p><p>When Burtynsky accepted his 2005 <a href=\\"/pages/view/id/6\\" target=\\"_blank\\">TED Prize</a>, he made three <a href=\\"/pages/view/id/109\\" target=\\"_blank\\">wishes</a>.

His second wish: to begin work on an Imax film, which morphed into the jaw-dropping film <em>Manufactured Landscapes</em> with Jennifer Baichwal. And his third wish, wider in scope, was simply to encourage &quot;a massive and productive worldwide conversation about sustainable living.&quot; Thanks to his help and the input of the TED community, the site <a href=\\"http://www.worldchanging.com/archives//006356.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" title=\\"WorldChanging.com\\">WorldChanging.com</a> got an infusion of energy that has helped it to grow into a leading voice in the sustainability community.</p><p>In 2016, he won a Governor General&#39;s Award in Visual and Media Arts for his work.</p>", "slug": "edward_burtynsky", "whotheyare": "2005 TED Prize winner Edward Burtynsky has made it his life\'s work to document humanity\'s impact on the planet.

photographer Edward Burtynsky&#39;s work in a single adjective, you have to speak French: <em>jolie-laide.</em> His images of scarred landscapes -- from mountains of tires to rivers of bright orange waste from a nickel mine -- are eerily pretty yet ugly at the same time. Burtynsky&#39;s large-format color photographs explore the impact of humanity&#39;s expanding footprint and the substantial ways in which we&#39;re reshaping the surface of the planet. His images powerfully alter the way we think about the world and our place in it. </p><p>With his blessing and encouragement, <a href=\\"http://www.worldchanging.com/archives//006356.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" title=\\"WorldChanging.com\\">WorldChanging.com</a>  and others use his work to inspire ongoing global conversations about sustainable living. Burtynsky&#39;s photographs are included in the collections of over 50 museums around the world, including the Tate, London and the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim in New York City. A large-format book, 2003&#39;s <a href=\\"http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=0300099436\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Manufactured Landscapes,</em></a> collected his work, and in 2007, a documentary based on his photography, also called <em><a href=\\"http://geni.us/manulandscapesdoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Manufactured Landscapes</a>,</em> debuted at the Toronto Film Festival before going on to screen at Sundance and elsewhere. It was released on DVD in March 2007. In 2008, after giving a talk at the&nbsp;Long Now Foundation, Burtynsky proposed &quot;The 10,000 Year Gallery,&quot; which could house art to be curated over thousands of years preserved through carbon transfers in an effort to reflect the attitudes and changes of the world over time.&nbsp;</p><p>When Burtynsky accepted his 2005 <a href=\\"/pages/view/id/6\\" target=\\"_blank\\">TED Prize</a>, he made three <a href=\\"/pages/view/id/109\\" target=\\"_blank\\">wishes</a>. One of his wishes: to build a website that will help kids think about going green. Thanks to WGBH and the TED community, the show and site <em><a href=\\"http://www.meetthegreens.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Meet the Greens</a></em> debuted at TED2007. His second wish: to begin work on an Imax film, which morphed into the jaw-dropping film <em>Manufactured Landscapes</em> with Jennifer Baichwal. And his third wish, wider in scope, was simply to encourage &quot;a massive and productive worldwide conversation about sustainable living.&quot; Thanks to his help and the input of the TED community, the site <a href=\\"http://www.worldchanging.com/archives//006356.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" title=\\"WorldChanging.com\\">WorldChanging.com</a> got an infusion of energy that has helped it to grow into a leading voice in the sustainability community.</p><p>In 2016, he won a Governor General&#39;s Award in Visual and Media Arts for his work.</p>", "slug": "edward_burtynsky", "whotheyare": "2005 TED Prize winner Edward Burtynsky has made it his life\'s work to document humanity\'s impact on the planet.

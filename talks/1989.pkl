VFirst of all, for those of you who
p5
aVare not familiar with my work,
p6
aVI create multicultural characters,
p7
aVso characters from lots of different backgrounds.
p8
aVSo before the present is the new future,
p9
aVa bit about the past is that I grew up in a family
p10
aVthat was multi-everything \u2014 multi-racial, multi-cultural,
p11
aVblack and white, Caribbean,
p12
aVIrish-American, German-American.
p13
aVThere was Dominican music blasting from stereos.
p14
aVThere were Christians and Jews.
p15
aVThat's a long story filled with
p16
aVintrigue and interfaith guilt and shame.
p17
aVBut I was totally immersed in this world
p18
aVthat was filled with everybody,
p19
aVand then I went on to the United Nations school,
p20
aVand that just completely \u2014
p21
aa(lp22
VSo I began sort of developing these voices
p23
aVand these people,
p24
aVall of whom were loosely based on people I really know,
p25
aVand so, for example, in performing them,
p26
aVI would really try to inhabit them.
p27
aVAnd for example,
p28
aVI don't really talk like that,
p29
aVbut that was one of my people,
p30
aVand I'm going to bring a few of my friends \u2014
p31
aVI think of them as my friends \u2014
p32
aVto this stage, in this spirit of the idea
p33
aVthat the present is the new future,
p34
aVin sort of a meta way,
p35
aVbecause I thought about it, and the future, for me,
p36
aVwhat can be so frightening
p37
aVis that I don't know what's coming.
p38
aVI don't know if that's true for other people,
p39
aVbut that notion of thinking about
p40
aVhow we can understand the future
p41
aVand predict outcomes,
p42
aVfor me, it's terrifying to not know what might be coming.
p43
aVAnd so the idea that there are questions
p44
aVthat I've never seen
p45
aVthat my people are going to answer,
p46
aVand some of these characters have been with me for ages,
p47
aVsome of them don't even have names,
p48
aVI don't know what's going to happen.
p49
aVI don't know what's coming,
p50
aVand all I can do is remind myself
p51
aVthat I told Chris I'd fly by the seat of my pants,
p52
aVand now that I'm up here it sort of feels like
p53
aVthat dream where you don't have any pants on,
p54
aVand so I suppose I'm going to be
p55
aVflying by the seat of my ass.
p56
aa(lp57
VThat said, let's just see who comes out.
p58
aVMay we have the first question:
p59
aa(lp60
V"Do you ever get headaches
p61
aVfrom the microchips implanted in your brain?"
p62
aVRight.
p63
aa(lp64
VOkay.
p65
aVWell first of all, I'll just say
p66
aVthat I hope you can hear me okay.
p67
aVMy name is Lorraine Levine,
p68
aVand the idea of microchips implanted in my brain,
p69
aVfrankly, just putting on my glasses reminds me
p70
aVof thank God I'm not wearing the Google Glasses.
p71
aVNo offense to them. I'm glad that you all enjoy them,
p72
aVbut at my age,
p73
aVjust putting on the regular ones I have
p74
aValready gives me too much information.
p75
aVDo you understand what I'm saying to you?
p76
aVI don't need to know more. I don't want to know.
p77
aVThat's it. That's enough.
p78
aVI love you all. You're wonderful.
p79
aVIt's fabulous to be here with such big machers
p80
aVagain this year. Mwah!
p81
aa(lp82
VOkay, next question. (Applause)
p83
aVNext, please.
p84
aa(lp85
V"Is dating boring,
p86
aVnow that humans reproduce asexually?"
p87
aa(lp88
VWho do we got?
p89
aa(lp90
VHi, um, okay, hi everybody.
p91
aVMy name is Nereida.
p92
aVI just want to say first of all
p93
aVthat dating is never boring under any circumstance.
p94
aVBut I am very excited to be here right now,
p95
aVso I am just trying to remind myself that,
p96
aVyou know, like, the purpose of being here and everything,
p97
aVI mean, trying to answer these questions, it is very exciting.
p98
aVBut I also, I just need to acknowledge
p99
aVthat TED is an incredible experience right now
p100
aVin the present, like, I just need to say, like,
p101
aVIsabel Allende. Isabel Allende!
p102
aVOkay, maybe it doesn't mean,
p103
aVof course it means something to you,
p104
aVbut to me, it's like, another level, okay?
p105
aVBecause I'm Latina and I really appreciate the fact
p106
aVthat there are role models here that I can really,
p107
aVI don't know, I just need to say that.
p108
aVThat's incredible to me, and sometimes when I'm nervous and everything like that,
p109
aVI just need to, like, say some affirmations
p110
aVthat can help me.
p111
aVI usually just try to use, like, the three little words
p112
aVthat always make me feel better:
p113
aVSotomayor, Sotomayor, Sotomayor. (Laughter)
p114
aVJust, it really helps me to get grounded.
p115
aVNow I can use Allende, Allende, Allende,
p116
aVand, you know, I just need to say it, like,
p117
aVit's so incredible to be here, and I knew that we were going to have these questions.
p118
aVI was so nervous and I was thinking just, like, oh my God, oh my God,
p119
aVand reminding me, because I've had, like, some very,
p120
aVespecially since the last time we were here at TED,
p121
aVit was, like, unbelievable,
p122
aVand then right after that, like,
p123
aVso many crazy things happened, like,
p124
aVwe ended up going to the White House to perform.
p125
aVThat was, like, amazing,
p126
aVand I'm standing there,
p127
aVand I was just like, please don't say, "Oh my God."
p128
aVDon't say, "Oh my God."
p129
aVAnd I just kept saying it: "Oh my God. Oh my God."
p130
aVAnd, you know, I kept thinking to myself, like,
p131
aVPresident Obama has to come up here at the same podium,
p132
aVand I'm standing here saying, "Oh my God."
p133
aVIt's like, the separation of church and state.
p134
aVIt's just, I couldn't, like, I couldn't process.
p135
aVIt was really too much.
p136
aVSo I think I've lost my way.
p137
aVBut what I wanted to say is that dating, for me,
p138
aVyou know, as far as I'm concerned,
p139
aVhowever you reproduce, as long as you're enjoying yourself
p140
aVand it's with another consenting asexual \u2014 I don't know.
p141
aVYou know where I'm going with that.
p142
aVOkay, ciao, gracias.
p143
aa(lp144
VOkay, next question. (Applause)
p145
aa(lp146
VWhat are your top five favorite songs right now?
p147
aa(lp148
VAll right, well first of all, I'mma say,
p149
aVyou know what I'm saying, I'm the only dude up here right now.
p150
aVMy name is Rashid,
p151
aVand I never been at TED before,
p152
aVyou know what I'm saying.
p153
aVI think, Sarah Jones, maybe she didn't want me to come out last time.
p154
aVI don't know why. You know what I'm saying.
p155
aVObviously I would be like a perfect fit for TED.
p156
aVYou know what I'm saying.
p157
aVFirst of all, that I'm in hip hop, you know what I'm saying.
p158
aVI know some of y'all may be not really
p159
aVas much into the music,
p160
aVbut the first way y'all can always know,
p161
aVyou know what I'm saying, that I'm in hip hop,
p162
aVis 'cos I hold the microphone
p163
aVin an official emcee posture.
p164
aVY'all can see that right there.
p165
aVThat's how you hold it.
p166
aVAll right, so you get your little tutorial right there.
p167
aVBut when Sarah Jones told me we was gonna come up here,
p168
aVI was like, betch, you know what I'm saying,
p169
aVTED is real fly, I got a whole lot of dope,
p170
aVyou know what I'm saying, shit going on and everything,
p171
aVbut she was like, yeah,
p172
aVwe're going to have to answer, like, some random questions,
p173
aVjust like, and I was like, what the hell is that?
p174
aVYou know what I'm saying, just stand up there
p175
aVand answer some random questions?
p176
aVI don't want to,
p177
aVI mean, it's like an intellectual stop-and-frisk.
p178
aVYou know what I'm saying? (Laughter)
p179
aVI don't want to be standing up there just
p180
aVall getting interrogated and whatnot.
p181
aVThat's what I'm trying to leave behind
p182
aVin New York. You know what I'm saying?
p183
aVSo anyway, I would have to say my top five songs right now
p184
aVis all out of my own personal catalogue,
p185
aVyou know what I mean?
p186
aVSo if you want to know more about that,
p187
aVyou know what I'm saying,
p188
aVwe could talk about the anti-piracy and all that,
p189
aVbut as far as I'm concerned,
p190
aVyou know, I believe in creative commons,
p191
aVand I think it's really important that, you know,
p192
aVthat needs to be sustainable and everything,
p193
aVand I mean, as far as I'm concerned,
p194
aVI mean, this right here,
p195
aVthis environment, I would like to sustain.
p196
aVYou know what I mean?
p197
aVBut I'm just saying, if y'all are interested
p198
aVin the top five songs, you need to holler at me.
p199
aVYou know what I'm saying?
p200
aVAight? In the future or the present. Yeah.
p201
aVEnjoy the rest of it.
p202
aa(lp203
VOkay, next question.
p204
aa(lp205
VWhat do you got?
p206
aa(lp207
V"How many of your organs have been 3D printed?"
p208
aV(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VWell I have to say that I don't know about
p211
aVhow many of my organs
p212
aVhave been 3-D printed as such,
p213
aVbut I can tell you that it is so challenging to me,
p214
aVkind of thinking about this concept of the future
p215
aVand that, you know, all around the world
p216
aVparents are kind of telling their small children,
p217
aVplease, you have to eat that, you know,
p218
aVI have slaved over a hot 3D printer all day
p219
aVso that you can have this meal.
p220
aVYou know, that kind of thing.
p221
aVAnd of course now that we have changed, you know,
p222
aVfrom the global South, there is this total
p223
aVkind of perspective shift that is happening around the \u2014
p224
aVYou can't just say to them,
p225
aVwell, there are starving children.
p226
aVWell, it is the future.
p227
aVNobody is starving anymore, thank God.
p228
aVBut as you can tell I have kind of that optimism,
p229
aVand I do hope that we can continue
p230
aVto kind of 3D print,
p231
aVwell, let us just say I like to think that
p232
aVeven in the future we will have the publication,
p233
aVkind of, you know, all the food that's fit to print.
p234
aVBut everybody, please do enjoy that,
p235
aVand again, I think that you do throw
p236
aVa cracking good party here at TED.
p237
aVThank you.
p238
aa(lp239
VNext question. (Applause)
p240
aa(lp241
VWhat has changed? Okay, it's like,
p242
aVI have to think about that.
p243
aV"What has changed now that women run the world?"
p244
aVFirst of all,
p245
aVI really, like, I just want to say,
p246
aVand my name is Bella,
p247
aVI just want to, like, identify myself,
p248
aVthat, like, as a feminist,
p249
aVI, like, I really find that, like,
p250
aVbecause I was born in the '90s,
p251
aVand, like, there were a lot of women who were
p252
aVas far as feminism was concerned,
p253
aVlike, maybe they didn't understand that, like,
p254
aVa feminist like me, like,
p255
aVI don't think it's required that you have to have
p256
aVa certain kind of voice,
p257
aVor, like, a certain way of presenting yourself
p258
aVto be feminist, because I think that, like,
p259
aVfeminism can be really hot,
p260
aVand I think actually that it's really vital and important.
p261
aVLike, the quotation I'm wearing is from, like,
p262
aVGloria Steinem,
p263
aVand, like, I'm named Bella for, like, Bella Abzug,
p264
aVwho's, like, obviously, like, a really important feminist from, like, history,
p265
aVand like, I just think that those women, like,
p266
aVreally represent, like, that you can, like,
p267
aVbe vital and, like, amazing,
p268
aVlike, a-mazing,
p269
aVand you don't have to wear, like,
p270
aVan Eileen Fisher caftan,
p271
aVjust to, like, prove that you are a feminist.
p272
aVLike, not that there's anything wrong with that,
p273
aVbut my mom, she's like, like,
p274
aVwhy do you have to wear pants that, like,
p275
aVobjectify your body? I like my pants.
p276
aVLike, I like my voice.
p277
aVLike, she's like, why do you have to talk like \u2014
p278
aVTalk like what? Like, I'm expressing myself,
p279
aVand I think that we have to, like,
p280
aVreach out, like, not only across, like,
p281
aVthe different generations of feminists,
p282
aVbut also across the, like, vocal ranges,
p283
aVso that, like, we,
p284
aVbecause otherwise it's just, like,
p285
aVrestriculous within feminism,
p286
aVwhich is just, like, a word that I created
p287
aVthat means, like, so strict it's ridiculous.
p288
aVSo that's my feeling about that.
p289
aVYou guys are a-mazing, by the way.
p290
aa(lp291
VOkay. Next question.
p292
aV(Applause)
p293
aa(lp294
V["They've discovered a cure for cancer, but not baldness? What's up with that?"]
p295
aa(lp296
VYeah, you know what,
p297
aVso my name is Joseph Mancuso.
p298
aVFirst of all, I just want to say that I appreciate
p299
aVthat TED in general has been a pretty orderly crowd,
p300
aVa pretty orderly group.
p301
aVAnd, you know, I just have to say,
p302
aVthe whole thing with baldness,
p303
aVand, you know, here's the thing.
p304
aVAs long as the woman, in my case \u2014
p305
aVbecause it's a modern world,
p306
aVdo whatever you want to do, I don't have any problem with anybody,
p307
aVenjoy yourself, LGBTQLMNOP. All right?
p308
aVBut as far as I'm concerned,
p309
aVattractiveness,
p310
aVwomen don't really care
p311
aVas much as you think they do
p312
aVabout the, you know.
p313
aVI mean, I remember hearing this woman.
p314
aVShe loved her husband, it was the sweetest thing.
p315
aVIt's a pretty young girl, you know?
p316
aVAnd this guy's older.
p317
aVAnd, you know, she said she would love him
p318
aVeven if he had snow on the roof
p319
aVor even if melted and disappeared altogether.
p320
aVAs far as I'm concerned, it's about the love.
p321
aVAm I right, or am I right?
p322
aVSo that's it. That's it. That's it.
p323
aVI don't got nothing more to say.
p324
aVKeep your noses clean.
p325
aa(lp326
VAll right, next question.
p327
aa(lp328
V"Have you ever tasted meat that's not lab grown?"
p329
aa(lp330
VUm, well, I,
p331
aVI want to start by saying
p332
aVthat this is a very difficult experience
p333
aVfor a Chinese-American.
p334
aVI don't know what to call myself now,
p335
aVbecause I have really my Chinese identity,
p336
aVbut my kids, they are American-Chinese,
p337
aVbut it's difficult to try to express myself
p338
aVin front of audience of people like this.
p339
aVBut if had to give my opinion about meat,
p340
aVI think first, the most important thing is to say
p341
aVthat we don't have to have perfect food,
p342
aVbut maybe it can also not be poison.
p343
aVMaybe we can have some middle ground for that.
p344
aVBut I will continue to consider this idea,
p345
aVand I will report back maybe next year.
p346
aa(lp347
VNext.
p348
aVNext. Next. (Applause)
p349
aa(lp350
V"Will there ever be a post-racial world?"
p351
aa(lp352
VThank you for having me.
p353
aVMy name is Gary Weaselhead. Enjoy that.
p354
aVI'm a member of the Blackfeet Nation.
p355
aVI'm also half Lakota, but that is my given name,
p356
aVand no, even though it would have seemed
p357
aVlike an obvious choice,
p358
aVno, I did not go into politics.
p359
aVTough crowd.
p360
aV(Laughter)
p361
aVBut I always like to just let people know
p362
aVwhen they ask about race or those kinds of things,
p363
aVyou know, as a member of the First Nations community,
p364
aVyou know, I'm probably
p365
aVnot your typical guy.
p366
aVFor example, in addition to being an activist,
p367
aVI'm also a professional stand-up comedian.
p368
aV(Laughter)
p369
aVAnd, you know, I'm most popular
p370
aVon college and university campuses.
p371
aVYou know, whenever they want to do a diversity day,
p372
aVor hey-we're-not-all-white week,
p373
aVthen I'm there. (Laughter)
p374
aVDo I think there will ever be a post-racial world?
p375
aVI think, really, I can't talk about race
p376
aVwithout remembering that it is a construct
p377
aVin certain respects,
p378
aVbut also that, you know,
p379
aVuntil we redress the wrongs of the past,
p380
aVwe're going to be turned around.
p381
aVI don't care if the present is the new future.
p382
aVI think there's a lot of great people here at TED
p383
aVwho are working to address that,
p384
aVso with that, if anything I've said today
p385
aVmakes you feel uncomfortable, you're welcome.
p386
aV(Applause)
p387
aa(lp388
VI think we have time for one more.
p389
aa(lp390
V"What's the most popular diet these days?"
p391
aa(lp392
VWho's here?
p393
aa(lp394
VOkay, well, I'm just gonna answer this really fast,
p395
aVas, like, three or four different people.
p396
aVI mean really fast.
p397
aVI'm just gonna let y'all know that, as far as diet is concerned,
p398
aVif you don't love yourself inside,
p399
aVthere is no diet on this Earth
p400
aVthat is going to make your behind small enough
p401
aVfor you to feel good,
p402
aVso just stop wasting your time.
p403
aa(lp404
VI would just like to say as an African woman
p405
aVthat I believe the diet that we need
p406
aVis really to remove the crazy belief
p407
aVthat there is anything wrong
p408
aVwith a nice backside.
p409
aVNo, I am teasing about that.
p410
aVThere is nothing wrong with a woman of size.
p411
aVThat is what I am trying to say.
p412
aVWomen, celebrate your body, for God's sake.
p413
aVStop running around starving.
p414
aVYou are making yourselves and other people miserable.
p415
aa(lp416
VLast answer.
p417
aa(lp418
VSo we're talking about what's the most popular diet?
p419
aVI'm gonna start off by telling y'all that
p420
aVthis is my first time here at TED.
p421
aVI might not be your typical person
p422
aVyou find on this stage.
p423
aVMy dental work not as nice as some people.
p424
aVBut I made Sarah Jones promise
p425
aVshe gonna bring me this time,
p426
aV'cause she didn't bring me before,
p427
aVbut you know, I just want to say,
p428
aVthere's a lot of things more important
p429
aVthan counting calories,
p430
aVand as somebody living on the streets in New York,
p431
aVand getting to come here, hear y'all ideas worth spreading,
p432
aVI want to tell y'all I believe in this idea
p433
aVthat the present is the new future,
p434
aVthat where you sit, you create everything
p435
aVthat's gonna come, for better or worse.
p436
aVAnd for me, I think homeless
p437
aVis the wrong word for it anyway.
p438
aVYou know, I might not have me no place
p439
aVto lay my head at night,
p440
aVbut that just makes me houseless.
p441
aVI have me a home. You do too.
p442
aVFind it and try to find yourself in there.
p443
aVMake sure you know,
p444
aVit's not just about virtual reality in space.
p445
aVThat's wonderful, but it's also about
p446
aVthe actual reality here on Earth.
p447
aVHow are people living today?
p448
aVHow can you be part of the solution?
p449
aVThank y'all for thinking about that
p450
aVright now in the present moment
p451
aVto influence the future.

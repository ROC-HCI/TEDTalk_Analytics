VI'm almost like a crazy evangelical.
p5
aVI've always known that the age of design is upon us,
p6
aValmost like a rapture.
p7
aVIf the day is sunny, I think,
p8
aV"Oh, the gods have had a good design day."
p9
aVOr, I go to a show and I see a beautiful piece by an artist,
p10
aVparticularly beautiful, I say
p11
aVhe's so good because he clearly looked to design
p12
aVto understand what he needed to do.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo I really do believe that design
p15
aVis the highest form of creative expression.
p16
aVThat's why I'm talking to you today about the age of design,
p17
aVand the age of design is the age in which design
p18
aVis still cute furniture, is still posters,
p19
aVis still fast cars, what you see at MoMA today.
p20
aVBut in truth, what I really would like to explain
p21
aVto the public and to the audiences of MoMA is that
p22
aVthe most interesting chairs are the ones
p23
aVthat are actually made by a robot,
p24
aVlike this beautiful chair by Dirk Vander Kooij,
p25
aVwhere a robot deposits a toothpaste-like slur
p26
aVof recycled refrigerator parts,
p27
aVas if he were a big candy, and makes a chair out of it.
p28
aVOr good design is digital fonts that we use all the time
p29
aVand that become part of our identity.
p30
aVI want people to understand
p31
aVthat design is so much more than cute chairs,
p32
aVthat it is first and foremost everything that is around us
p33
aVin our life.
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd it's interesting how so much of what we're talking about
p36
aVtonight is not simply design but interaction design.
p37
aVAnd in fact, interaction design is what I've been trying
p38
aVto insert in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art
p39
aVfor a few years, starting not very timidly
p40
aVbut just pointedly with works, for instance,
p41
aVby Martin Wattenberg \u2014 the way a machine
p42
aVplays chess with itself, that you see here,
p43
aVor Lisa Strausfeld and her partners, the Sugar interface
p44
aVfor One Laptop Per Child,
p45
aVToshio Iwai's Tenori-On musical instruments,
p46
aVand Philip Worthington's Shadow Monsters,
p47
aVand John Maeda's Reactive Books,
p48
aVand also Jonathan Harris and Sep Kamvar's I Want You To Want Me.
p49
aVThese were some of the first acquisitions that really
p50
aVintroduced the idea of interaction design to the public.
p51
aa(lp52
VBut more recently, I've been trying really to go even deeper
p53
aVinto interaction design with examples
p54
aVthat are emotionally really suggestive
p55
aVand that really explain interaction design at a level
p56
aVthat is almost undeniable.
p57
aVThe Wind Map, by Wattenberg and Fernanda Viégas,
p58
aVI don't know if you've ever seen it \u2014 it's really fantastic.
p59
aVIt looks at the territory of the United States
p60
aVas if it were a wheat field that is procured by the winds
p61
aVand that is really giving you a pictorial image
p62
aVof what's going on with the winds in the United States.
p63
aa(lp64
VBut also, more recently, we started acquiring video games,
p65
aVand that's where all hell broke loose
p66
aVin a really interesting way. (Laughter)
p67
aVThere are still people that believe that there's a high and there's a low.
p68
aVAnd that's really what I find so intriguing
p69
aVabout the reactions that we've had to the anointment
p70
aVof video games in the MoMA collection.
p71
aVWe've \u2014 No, first of all, New York Magazine always gets it.
p72
aVI love them. So we are in the right quadrant.
p73
aVWe are in the Highbrow \u2014 that's daring, that's courageous \u2014
p74
aVand Brilliant, which is great.
p75
aVTimidly, we've been higher on the diagonal in other situations,
p76
aVbut it's okay. It's good. It's good. It's good. (Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VBut here comes the art critic. Oh, that was fantastic.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo the first was Jonathan Jones from The Guardian.
p81
aV"Sorry, MoMA, video games are not art."
p82
aVDid I ever say they were art? I was talking about interaction design. Excuse me.
p83
aV"Exhibiting Pac-Man and Tetris alongside Picasso and Van Gogh" \u2014
p84
aVThey're two floors away. (Laughter) \u2014
p85
aV"will mean game over for any real understanding of art."
p86
aVI'm bringing in the end of the world. You know?
p87
aVWe were talking about the rapture? It's coming.
p88
aVAnd Jonathan Jones is making it happen.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo the same Guardian rebuts,
p91
aV"Are video games art: the debate that shouldn't be.
p92
aVLast week, Guardian art critic blah blah suggested
p93
aVthat games cannot qualify as art. But is he right?
p94
aVAnd does it matter?" Thank you. Does it matter?
p95
aa(lp96
VYou know, it's like once again there's this whole problem
p97
aVof design being often misunderstood for art,
p98
aVor the idea that is so diffuse that designers want to
p99
aVaspire to, would like to be called, artists.
p100
aVNo. Designers aspire to be really great designers.
p101
aVThank you very much. And that's more than enough.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo my knight in shining armor, John Maeda,
p104
aVwithout any prompt, came out with this big declaration
p105
aVon why video games belong in the MoMA.
p106
aVAnd that was fantastic. And I thought that was it.
p107
aa(lp108
VBut then there was another wonderfully pretentious article
p109
aVthat came out in The New Republic, so pretentious,
p110
aVby Liel Leibovitz, and it said, "MoMA has mistaken video games for art." Again.
p111
aV"The museum is putting Pac-Man alongside Picasso." Again.
p112
aV"That misses the point."
p113
aVExcuse me. You're missing the point.
p114
aVAnd here, look, the above question is put bluntly:
p115
aV"Are video games art? No. Video games aren't art
p116
aVbecause they are quite thoroughly something else: code."
p117
aVOh, so Picasso is not art because it's oil paint. Right?
p118
aa(lp119
VSo it's so fantastic to see
p120
aVhow these feathers that were ruffled,
p121
aVand these reactions, were so vehement.
p122
aVAnd you know what?
p123
aVThe International Cat Video Film Festival
p124
aVdidn't have that much of a reaction. (Laughter)
p125
aVI think this was truly fantastic.
p126
aVWe were talking about dancing ponies, but I was really jealous
p127
aVof the Walker Arts Center for putting up this festival,
p128
aVbecause it's very, very wonderful.
p129
aVAnd there's this Flaubert quote that I love:
p130
aV"I have always tried to live in an ivory tower,
p131
aVbut a tide of shit is beating at its walls,
p132
aVthreatening to undermine it."
p133
aVI consider myself the tide of shit.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p136
aa(lp137
VYou know, we have to go through that.
p138
aVEven in the 1930s, my colleagues
p139
aVthat were trying to put together an abstract art show
p140
aVhad all of these works stopped by the customs officers
p141
aVthat decided they were not art.
p142
aVSo it's happened before, and it will happen in the future,
p143
aVbut right now I can tell you that I am so, so proud
p144
aVto be able to call Pac-Man part of the MoMA collection.
p145
aVAnd the same with, for instance, Tetris, original version, the Soviet one.
p146
aVAnd you know, the amount of work \u2014
p147
aVyeah, Alexey Pajitnov was working for the Soviet government
p148
aVand that's how he developed Tetris,
p149
aVand Alexey himself reconstructed the whole game
p150
aVand even gave us a simulation of the cathode ray tube
p151
aVthat makes it look slightly bombed.
p152
aVAnd it's fantastic.
p153
aa(lp154
VSo behind these acquisitions is an enormous amount of work,
p155
aVbecause we're still the Museum of Modern Art,
p156
aVso even when we tackle popular culture,
p157
aVwe tackle it as a form of interaction design
p158
aVand as something that has to go into the collection at MoMA,
p159
aVtherefore, has to be researched.
p160
aVSo to get to choosing Eric Chahi's
p161
aVwonderful Another World, amongst others,
p162
aVwe put together a panel of experts,
p163
aVand we worked on this acquisition,
p164
aVand it's mostly myself and Kate Carmody and Paul Galloway.
p165
aVWe worked on it for a year and a half.
p166
aVSo many people helped us \u2014 designers of games,
p167
aVyou might know Jamin Warren
p168
aVand his collaborators at Kill Screen magazine,
p169
aVand you know, Kevin Slavin. You name it.
p170
aVWe bugged everybody, because we knew that we were ignorant.
p171
aVWe were not real gamers enough,
p172
aVso we had to really talk to them.
p173
aVAnd so we decided, of course, to have Sim City 2000,
p174
aVnot the other Sim City, that one in particular,
p175
aVso the criteria that we developed along the way
p176
aVwere really strong, and were not only criteria of selection.
p177
aVThey were also criteria of exhibition and of preservation.
p178
aVThat's what makes this acquisition more than a little game
p179
aVor a little joke. It's truly a way to think of how to preserve
p180
aVand show artifacts that will more and more
p181
aVbecome part of our lives in the future.
p182
aVWe live today, as you know very well, not in the digital,
p183
aVnot in the physical, but in the kind of minestrone
p184
aVthat our mind makes of the two.
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd that's really where interaction lies,
p187
aVand that's the importance of interaction.
p188
aVAnd in order to explain interaction, we need to really
p189
aVbring people in and make them realize
p190
aVhow interaction is part of their lives.
p191
aVSo when I talk about it, I don't talk only about video games,
p192
aVwhich are in a way the purest form of interaction,
p193
aVunadulterated by any kind of function or finality.
p194
aVI also talk about the MetroCard vending machine,
p195
aVwhich I consider a masterpiece of interaction.
p196
aVI mean, that interface is beautiful.
p197
aVIt looks like a burly MTA guy coming out of the tunnel.
p198
aVYou know, with your mitt you can actually paw
p199
aVthe MetroCard, and I talk about how bad
p200
aVATM machines usually are.
p201
aVSo I let people understand that it's up to them
p202
aVto know how to judge interaction
p203
aVso as to know when it's good or when it's bad.
p204
aVSo when I show The Sims,
p205
aVI try to make people really feel what it meant
p206
aVto have an interaction with The Sims,
p207
aVnot only the fun but also the responsibility
p208
aVthat came with the Tamagotchi.
p209
aa(lp210
VYou know, video games can be truly deep
p211
aVeven when they're completely mindless.
p212
aVI'm sure that all of you know Katamari Damacy.
p213
aVIt's about rolling a ball and picking up as many objects as you can
p214
aVin a finite amount of time
p215
aVand hopefully you'll be able to make it into a planet.
p216
aVI've never made it into a planet, but that's it.
p217
aVOr, you know, Vib-Ribbon was not distributed here in the United States.
p218
aVIt was a PlayStation game, but mostly for Japan.
p219
aVAnd it was one of the first video games
p220
aVin which you could choose your own music.
p221
aVSo you would put into the PlayStation,
p222
aVyou would put your own CD,
p223
aVand then the game would change alongside your music. So really fantastic.
p224
aa(lp225
VNot to mention Eve Online.
p226
aVEve Online is an artificial universe, if you wish,
p227
aVbut one of the diplomats that was killed in Benghazi,
p228
aVnot Ambassador Stevens, but one of his collaborators,
p229
aVwas a really big shot in Eve Online,
p230
aVso here you have a diplomat in the real world
p231
aVthat spends his time in Eve Online
p232
aVto kind of test, maybe, all of his ideas about diplomacy
p233
aVand about universe-building, and to the point that
p234
aVthe first announcement of the bombing
p235
aVwas actually given on Eve Online,
p236
aVand after his death, several parts of the universe
p237
aVwere named after him.
p238
aVAnd I was just recently at the Eve Online fan festival
p239
aVin Reykjavík that was quite amazing.
p240
aVI mean, we're talking about an experience
p241
aVthat of course can seem weird to many,
p242
aVbut that is very educational.
p243
aVOf course, there are games that are even more educational.
p244
aa(lp245
VDwarf Fortress is like the holy grail
p246
aVof this kind of massive multiplayer online game,
p247
aVand in fact the two Adams brothers were in Reykjavík,
p248
aVand they were greeted
p249
aVby a standing ovation by all the Eve Online fans.
p250
aVIt was amazing to see. And it's a beautiful game.
p251
aVSo you start seeing here that
p252
aVthe aesthetics that are so important
p253
aVto a museum collection like MoMA's
p254
aVare kept alive also by the selection of these games.
p255
aa(lp256
VAnd you know, Valve \u2014 you know, Portal \u2014
p257
aVis an example of a video game in which
p258
aVyou have a certain type of violence
p259
aVwhich also leads me to talk about
p260
aVone of the biggest issues that we had to discuss
p261
aVwhen we acquired the video games, what to do with violence.
p262
aVRight? We had to make decisions.
p263
aVAt MoMA, interestingly, there's a lot of violence
p264
aVdepicted in the art part of the collection,
p265
aVbut when I came to MoMA 19 years ago, and as an Italian,
p266
aVI said, "You know what, we need a Beretta."
p267
aVAnd I was told, "No. No guns in the design collection."
p268
aVAnd I was like, "Why?"
p269
aVInterestingly, I learned that it's considered
p270
aVthat in design and in the design collection,
p271
aVwhat you see is what you get.
p272
aVSo when you see a gun, it's an instrument for killing in the design collection.
p273
aVIf it's in the art collection,
p274
aVit might be a critique of the killing instrument.
p275
aVSo it's very interesting.
p276
aVBut we are acquiring our critical dimension also in design,
p277
aVso maybe one day we'll be able to acquire also the guns.
p278
aVBut here, in this particular case, we decided,
p279
aVyou know, with Kate and Paul,
p280
aVthat we would have no gratuitous violence.
p281
aVSo we have Portal because you shoot walls
p282
aVin order to create new spaces.
p283
aVWe have Street Fighter II, because martial arts are good.
p284
aV(Laughter)
p285
aVBut we don't have GTA because,
p286
aVmaybe it's my own reflection,
p287
aVI've never been able to do anything but crashing cars
p288
aVand shooting prostitutes and pimps.
p289
aVSo it was not very constructive. (Laughter)
p290
aVSo, I'm making fun of it, but we discussed this
p291
aVfor so many days. You have no idea.
p292
aVAnd to this day, I am ambivalent,
p293
aVbut when you have instead games like Flow, there's no doubt.
p294
aVIt's like, it's about serenity and it's about sublime.
p295
aVIt's about experiencing what it means to be a sea creature.
p296
aVThen we have a few also side-scrollers \u2014 classical ones.
p297
aVSo it's quite a hefty collection.
p298
aa(lp299
VAnd right now, we started with the first 14,
p300
aVbut we have several that are coming up,
p301
aVand the reason why we haven't acquired them yet
p302
aVis because you don't acquire just the game.
p303
aVYou acquire the relationship with the company.
p304
aVWhat we want, what we aspire to, is the code.
p305
aVIt's very hard to get, of course.
p306
aVBut that's what would enable us to preserve
p307
aVthe video games for a really long time,
p308
aVand that's what museums do.
p309
aVThey also preserve artifacts for posterity.
p310
aVIn absence of the code, because, you know,
p311
aVvideo game companies are not very forthcoming in some cases,
p312
aVin absence of that, we acquire the relationship with the company.
p313
aVWe're going to stay with them forever.
p314
aVThey're not going to get rid of us.
p315
aVAnd one day, we'll get that code. (Laughter)
p316
aa(lp317
VBut I want to explain to you the criteria that we chose
p318
aVfor interaction design. Aesthetics are really important.
p319
aVAnd I'm showing you Core War here,
p320
aVwhich is an early game that takes advantage aesthetically
p321
aVof the limitations of the processor.
p322
aVSo the kind of interferences that you see here
p323
aVthat look like beautiful barriers in the game
p324
aVare actually a consequence of the processor's limitedness,
p325
aVwhich is fantastic. So aesthetics is always important.
p326
aa(lp327
VAnd so is space, the spatial aspect of games.
p328
aVYou know, I feel that the best video games
p329
aVare the ones that have really savvy architects
p330
aVthat are behind them, and if they're not architects,
p331
aVbona fide trained in architecture, they have that feeling.
p332
aVBut the spatial evolution in video games is extremely important.
p333
aa(lp334
VTime. The way we experience time in video games,
p335
aVas in other forms of interaction design,
p336
aVis really quite amazing.
p337
aVIt can be real time or it can be the time within the game,
p338
aVas is in Animal Crossing, where seasons
p339
aVfollow each other at their own pace.
p340
aa(lp341
VSo time, space, aesthetics,
p342
aVand then, most important, behavior.
p343
aVThe real core issue of interaction design is behavior.
p344
aVDesigners that deal with interaction design behaviors
p345
aVthat go to influence the rest of our lives.
p346
aVThey're not just limited to our interaction with the screen.
p347
aVIn this case, I'm showing you Marble Madness,
p348
aVwhich is a beautiful game
p349
aVin which the controller is a big sphere that vibrates with you,
p350
aVso you have a sphere that's moving in this landscape,
p351
aVand the sphere, the controller itself, gives you a sense of the movement.
p352
aVIn a way, you can see how video games
p353
aVare the purest aspect of interaction design
p354
aVand are very useful to explain what interaction is.
p355
aa(lp356
VWe don't want to show the video games
p357
aVwith the paraphernalia. No arcade nostalgia.
p358
aVIf anything, we want to show the code,
p359
aVand here you see Ben Fry's distellamap of Pac-Man,
p360
aVof the Pac-Man code.
p361
aa(lp362
VSo the way we acquired the games is very interesting
p363
aVand very unorthodox. You see them here
p364
aVdisplayed alongside other examples of design,
p365
aVfurniture and other parts,
p366
aVbut there's no paraphernalia, no nostalagia,
p367
aVonly the screen and a little shelf with the controllers.
p368
aVThe controllers are, of course, part of the experience,
p369
aVso you cannot do away with it.
p370
aVBut interestingly, this choice was not condemned
p371
aVtoo vehemently by gamers.
p372
aVI was afraid that they would kill us,
p373
aVand instead they understood, especially
p374
aVwhen I told them that I was trying to apply the same stratagem
p375
aVthat Philip Johnson applied in 1934
p376
aVwhen he wanted to make people understand
p377
aVthe importance of design, and he took propeller blades
p378
aVand pieces of machinery and
p379
aVin the MoMA galleries he put them on white pedestals
p380
aVagainst white walls, as if they were Brancusi sculptures.
p381
aVHe created this strange distance, this shock,
p382
aVthat made people realize how gorgeous formally,
p383
aVand also important functionally, design pieces were.
p384
aVI would like to do the same with video games.
p385
aVBy getting rid of the sticky carpets and the cigarette butts
p386
aVand everything else that we might remember from our childhood,
p387
aVI want people to understand
p388
aVthat those are important forms of design.
p389
aVAnd in a way, the video games, the fonts and everything else
p390
aVlead us to make people understand
p391
aVa wider meaning for design.
p392
aa(lp393
VOne of my dream acquisitions,
p394
aVwhich has been on hold for a few years
p395
aVbut now will come back on the front burner,
p396
aVis a 747.
p397
aVI would like to acquire it, but without owning it.
p398
aVI don't want it to be at MoMA and possessed by MoMA.
p399
aVI want it to keep flying.
p400
aVSo it's an acquisition where MoMA makes an arrangement
p401
aVwith an airline and keeps the Boeing 747 flying.
p402
aa(lp403
VAnd the same with the "@" sign that we acquired a few years ago.
p404
aVIt was the first example of an acquisition of something
p405
aVthat is in the public domain.
p406
aVAnd what I say to people, it's almost as if
p407
aVa butterfly were flying by
p408
aVand we captured the shadow on the wall,
p409
aVand just we're showing the shadow.
p410
aVSo in a way, we're showing a manifestation
p411
aVof something that is truly important
p412
aVand that is part of our identity but that nobody can have.
p413
aVAnd it's too long to explain the acquisition,
p414
aVbut if you want to go on the MoMA blog,
p415
aVthere's a long post where I explain why
p416
aVit's such a great example of design.
p417
aa(lp418
VAlong the way, I've had to burn a few chairs. You know?
p419
aVI've had to do away with a few concepts of design past.
p420
aVBut I see that people are coming along,
p421
aVthat the audiences, paradoxically,
p422
aVare much more responsive and much more understanding
p423
aVof this expansion of design than some of my colleagues are.
p424
aVDesign is truly everywhere,
p425
aVand design is as important as anything,
p426
aVand I'm so glad that, because of its diversity
p427
aVand because of its centrality to our lives,
p428
aVmany more people are coming to it
p429
aVas a profession, as a passion,
p430
aVand as, very simply, part of their own culture.
p431

VTom Green: That's a 4chan thing.
p5
aVThese kids on the Internet, they have this group of kids
p6
aVand they like to say funny words
p7
aVlike "barrel roll."
p8
aVIt's a video game move from "Star Fox."
p9
aV"Star Fox 20"? (Assistant: "Star Fox 64.")
p10
aVTom Green: Yeah. And they've been dogging me for a year.
p11
aVI got to tell you, it's driving me nuts, actually.
p12
aVSometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I scream,
p13
aV"4chan!"
p14
aa(lp15
VChristopher Poole: When I was 15,
p16
aVI found this website called Futaba Channel.
p17
aVAnd it was a Japanese forum and imageboard.
p18
aVThat format of forum, at that time,
p19
aVwas not well-known outside of Japan.
p20
aVAnd so what I did is I took it, I translated it into English,
p21
aVand I stuck it up for my friends to use.
p22
aVNow, six and a half years later,
p23
aVover seven million people are using it,
p24
aVcontributing over 700,000 posts per day.
p25
aVAnd we've gone from one board
p26
aVto 48 boards.
p27
aa(lp28
VThis is what it looks like.
p29
aVSo, what's unique about the site
p30
aVis that it's anonymous,
p31
aVand it has no memory.
p32
aVThere's no archive, there are no barriers, there's no registration.
p33
aVThese things that we're used to with forums
p34
aVdon't exist on 4chan.
p35
aVAnd that's led to this
p36
aVdiscussion that's completely raw, completely unfiltered.
p37
aVWhat the site's known for,
p38
aVbecause it has this environment,
p39
aVis it's fostered the creation of a lot of
p40
aVInternet phenomena, viral videos and whatnot, known as "memes."
p41
aa(lp42
VTwo of the largest memes that have come out of this site
p43
aVsome of you might be familiar with are these LOLcats \u2014
p44
aVjust silly pictures of cats with text.
p45
aVAnd this resonates with millions of people, apparently,
p46
aVbecause there are tens of thousands of these,
p47
aVand there is a whole blogging empire now
p48
aVdedicated to pictures like these.
p49
aVAnd Rick Astley's kind of rebirth
p50
aVthese past two years ...
p51
aVRickroll was this bait and switch,
p52
aVreally simple, classic bait and switch.
p53
aVSomebody says they're linking to something interesting,
p54
aVand you get an '80s pop song. That's all it was.
p55
aVAnd it got big enough to the point where
p56
aVthere was a float last year at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade,
p57
aVand Rick Astley pops out, and rickrolls
p58
aVmillions of people on television.
p59
aV(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VThere are thousands of memes that come out of the site.
p62
aVThere are a handful that have escaped into the mainstream,
p63
aVthe ones I've just shown you,
p64
aVbut every day, every month,
p65
aVpeople are producing thousands of these.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo does a site like this have rules?
p68
aVWe do; they're the codified rules that I've come up with,
p69
aVwhich are more-or-less ignored by the community.
p70
aVAnd so they've come up with their own set of rules,
p71
aVthe "Rules of the Internet."
p72
aVAnd so there are three that I want to show you specifically.
p73
aVRule one is you don't talk about /b/.
p74
aVTwo is you do not talk about /b/.
p75
aVAnd this one's kind of interesting:
p76
aV"If it exists, there is porn of it. No exceptions."
p77
aV(Laughter)
p78
aVAnd I will spare you that slide.
p79
aVI assure you, it is very true.
p80
aa(lp81
V/b/ is the first board we started with,
p82
aVand it is, in many ways,
p83
aVthe beating heart of the website.
p84
aVIt is where a third of all the traffic is going.
p85
aVAnd /b/ is known for,
p86
aVmore than anything,
p87
aVnot just the memes they've created, but the exploits.
p88
aVAnd Chris just touched on one of those a second ago,
p89
aVand that was the Time 100 poll.
p90
aVSo somebody at Time, at the magazine,
p91
aVthought it would be fun to nominate me
p92
aVfor this thing they did last year.
p93
aVAnd so they placed me on it,
p94
aVand the Internet got wind of it. My community
p95
aVdecided they wanted me to win it.
p96
aVI didn't instruct them to do it; they just decided that that's what they wanted.
p97
aVAnd so, you know, 390 percent approval rating ain't so bad.
p98
aV(Laughter)
p99
aVSo they broke that poll.
p100
aVAnd I ended up on top.
p101
aVI ended up at this really fancy party.
p102
aa(lp103
VBut that's not what's interesting about this.
p104
aVIt's that they weren't putting me at the top of this list;
p105
aVthey were actually \u2014
p106
aVit got so sophisticated to the point where they gamed
p107
aVall of the top 21 places
p108
aVto spell "mARBLECAKE. ALSO, THE GAME."
p109
aV(Laughter)
p110
aVThe amount of time and effort that went into that
p111
aVis absolutely incredible.
p112
aVAnd "marble cake" is significant because
p113
aVit is the channel that this group called Anonymous organized.
p114
aVAnonymous is this group of people
p115
aVthat protested, very famously,
p116
aVScientology.
p117
aVThe story is,
p118
aVScientology had this embarrassing video of Tom Cruise. It went up online.
p119
aVThey got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the Internet.
p120
aVAnd so these people, over 7,000 people,
p121
aVless than one month later,
p122
aVorganized in a hundred cities around the globe and \u2014
p123
aVthis is L.A. \u2014
p124
aVprotested the Church of Scientology,
p125
aVand they have continued to do so,
p126
aVnow, two full years after the fact.
p127
aVThey are still protesting.
p128
aV(Laughter)
p129
aVSo we've got this activist group that's this grassroots group
p130
aVthat's come out of the site.
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd last, I'm going to show you the example,
p133
aVthe story of Dusty the cat.
p134
aVDusty is the name that we've given to this cat.
p135
aVThis young man
p136
aVposted a video
p137
aVof him abusing his cat on YouTube.
p138
aVAnd, you know, this didn't sit well with people,
p139
aVand so there was this outpouring of support
p140
aVfor people to do something about this.
p141
aVSo what they did is they \u2014 I mean, they put CSI to shame here \u2014
p142
aVthe Internet detectives came out.
p143
aVThey matched, they found his MySpace.
p144
aVThey took the YouTube video and they mashed everything in the video.
p145
aVWithin 24 hours,
p146
aVthey had his name,
p147
aVand within 48 hours, he was arrested.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Applause)
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd so, what I think is really intriguing
p152
aVabout a community like 4chan
p153
aVis just that it's this open place.
p154
aVAs I said, it's raw, it's unfiltered.
p155
aVAnd sites like it are kind of
p156
aVgoing the way of the dinosaur right now.
p157
aVThey're endangered because we're moving
p158
aVtowards social networking.
p159
aVWe're moving towards persistent identity.
p160
aVWe're moving towards,
p161
aVyou know, a lack of privacy, really.
p162
aVWe're sacrificing a lot of that, and I think in doing so,
p163
aVmoving towards those things, we're losing something valuable.
p164
aa(lp165
VThank you.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Applause)
p168
aa(lp169
VChris Anderson: Thank you.
p170
aVGot a couple questions for you.
p171
aVBut if I ask them, is the TED website going to go down?
p172
aa(lp173
VCP: You're lucky that this is not
p174
aVbeing streamed to them live right now.
p175
aa(lp176
VCA: Well, you never know. Some of them \u2014
p177
aVwe've got people in 75 countries out there watching.
p178
aVDon't tell.
p179
aVBut seriously,
p180
aVthis issue on anonymity is \u2014
p181
aVI mean, you made the case there.
p182
aVBut anonymity basically allows people to say anything,
p183
aVall the rules gone.
p184
aVYou've had to wrestle with issues like child pornography.
p185
aVAnd I'm just curious whether you
p186
aVsometimes lie awake in the night
p187
aVworrying that you've opened Pandora's box.
p188
aa(lp189
VCP: Yes and no.
p190
aVI mean, for as much good
p191
aVthat kind of comes out of this environment,
p192
aVthere is plenty of bad.
p193
aVThere are plenty of downsides.
p194
aVBut I think that the greater good
p195
aVis being served here by just allowing people \u2014
p196
aVthere are very few places, now, where you can go
p197
aVand not have identity, to be completely anonymous
p198
aVand say whatever you'd like.
p199
aVAnd saying whatever you like, I think, is powerful.
p200
aVDoing whatever you like is now crossing a line.
p201
aVBut I think it's important to have these places.
p202
aVWhen I get emails, people say, "Thank you for giving me this place,
p203
aVthis outlet, where I can come after work
p204
aVand be myself."
p205
aa(lp206
VCA: But words, saying things,
p207
aVyou know, can be constructive; it can be really damaging.
p208
aVAnd if you cut the link between what is said
p209
aVand any attribution back to you,
p210
aVI mean, surely there are huge risks with that.
p211
aa(lp212
VCP: There are, certainly.
p213
aVBut \u2014
p214
aa(lp215
VCA: Tell me about what \u2014 I mean, I think you asked the board
p216
aVwhat you might say at TED, right?
p217
aa(lp218
VCP: Yeah, I posted a thread
p219
aVon Sunday.
p220
aVAnd within 24 hours,
p221
aVit had over 12,000 responses.
p222
aVAnd the thing is,
p223
aVI didn't make it into that presentation
p224
aVbecause I can't read to you anything that they said, more or less.
p225
aV(Laughter)
p226
aV99 percent of it is just,
p227
aVwould have been, you know, bleeped out.
p228
aVBut there were some good things that came out of that too.
p229
aV(Laughter)
p230
aVLove and peace were mentioned.
p231
aa(lp232
VCA: Love and peace were mentioned,
p233
aVkind of with quote marks around them, right?
p234
aa(lp235
VCP: Cats and dogs were mentioned too.
p236
aVCA: And that content is all off the board now.
p237
aVRight, it's gone? Or is it still up there?
p238
aa(lp239
VCP: I stuck that thread so it lasted a few days.
p240
aVIt went up to about 16,000 posts,
p241
aVand now it has been taken off.
p242
aa(lp243
VCA: Okay, well.
p244
aVNow, I'm not sure I would have necessarily recommended
p245
aVeveryone at TED to go and check it out anyway.
p246
aVChris, you yourself? I mean, you're a figure of some intrigue.
p247
aVYou've got this surprising
p248
aVsemi-underground influence,
p249
aVbut it's not making you a lot of money, yet.
p250
aVWhat's the commercial picture here?
p251
aa(lp252
VCP: The commercial picture is that there really isn't
p253
aVmuch of one, I guess.
p254
aVThe site has adult content on it.
p255
aVI mean, obviously, it's got some very offensive, obscene content on it,
p256
aVjust in terms of language alone.
p257
aVAnd when you've got that, you've pretty much sacrificed
p258
aVany hope of making lots of money.
p259
aa(lp260
VCA: But you still live at home, right?
p261
aa(lp262
VCP: I actually moved out recently.
p263
aa(lp264
VCA: That's very cool.
p265
aa(lp266
V(Applause)
p267
aa(lp268
VCP: I got out of Mom's, and I'm back in school right now.
p269
aa(lp270
VCA: But what conversations did you or do you
p271
aVhave with your mother about 4chan?
p272
aa(lp273
VCP: At first, very kind of pained,
p274
aVawkward conversations.
p275
aVThe content is not dinner table conversation in the least.
p276
aVBut my parents \u2014 I think part of why
p277
aVthey kind of are able to appreciate it
p278
aVis because they don't understand it.
p279
aV(Laughter)
p280
aVCA: And they were probably pleased to see you
p281
aVon top of the Time poll.
p282
aa(lp283
VCP: Yeah. They still didn't know what to think of that though.
p284
aa(lp285
V(Laughter)
p286
aa(lp287
VCA: And so, in 10 years' time,
p288
aVwhat do you picture yourself doing?
p289
aa(lp290
VCP: That's a good question.
p291
aVAs I said, I just went back to school,
p292
aVand I am considering
p293
aVmajoring in urban studies
p294
aVand then going on to urban planning,
p295
aVkind of taking whatever I've learned from online communities
p296
aVand trying to adapt that
p297
aVto a physical community.
p298
aa(lp299
VCA: Chris, thank you. Absolutely fascinating. Thank you for coming to TED.

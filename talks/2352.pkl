VFather Daniel Berrigan once said that "writing about prisoners
p5
aVis a little like writing about the dead."
p6
aVI think what he meant is that we treat prisoners as ghosts.
p7
aVThey're unseen and unheard.
p8
aVIt's easy to simply ignore them
p9
aVand it's even easier when the government goes to great lengths to keep them hidden.
p10
aa(lp11
VAs a journalist, I think these stories
p12
aVof what people in power do when no one is watching,
p13
aVare precisely the stories that we need to tell.
p14
aVThat's why I began investigating
p15
aVthe most secretive and experimental prison units in the United States,
p16
aVfor so-called "second-tier" terrorists.
p17
aVThe government calls these units Communications Management Units or CMUs.
p18
aVPrisoners and guards call them "Little Guantanamo."
p19
aVThey are islands unto themselves.
p20
aVBut unlike Gitmo they exist right here, at home,
p21
aVfloating within larger federal prisons.
p22
aa(lp23
VThere are 2 CMUs.
p24
aVOne was opened inside the prison in Terre Haute, Indiana,
p25
aVand the other is inside this prison, in Marion, Illinois.
p26
aVNeither of them underwent the formal review process
p27
aVthat is required by law when they were opened.
p28
aVCMU prisoners have all been convicted of crimes.
p29
aVSome of their cases are questionable and some involve threats and violence.
p30
aVI'm not here to argue the guilt or innocence of any prisoner.
p31
aVI'm here because as Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall said,
p32
aV"When the prisons and gates slam shut,
p33
aVprisoners do not lose their human quality."
p34
aa(lp35
VEvery prisoner I've interviewed has said there are three flecks of light
p36
aVin the darkness of prison:
p37
aVphone calls,
p38
aVletters
p39
aVand visits from family.
p40
aVCMUs aren't solitary confinement, but they radically restrict all of these
p41
aVto levels that meet or exceed the most extreme prisons in the United States.
p42
aVTheir phone calls can be limited to 45 minutes a month,
p43
aVcompared to the 300 minutes other prisoners receive.
p44
aVTheir letters can be limited to six pieces of paper.
p45
aVTheir visits can be limited to four hours per month,
p46
aVcompared to the 35 hours that people like Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph
p47
aVreceive in the supermax.
p48
aVOn top of that, CMU visits are non-contact which means prisoners are not allowed
p49
aVto even hug their family.
p50
aVAs one CMU prisoner said,
p51
aV"We're not being tortured here, except psychologically."
p52
aa(lp53
VThe government won't say who is imprisoned here.
p54
aVBut through court documents, open records requests
p55
aVand interviews with current and former prisoners,
p56
aVsome small windows into the CMUs have opened.
p57
aa(lp58
VThere's an estimated 60 to 70 prisoners here,
p59
aVand they're overwhelmingly Muslim.
p60
aVThey include people like Dr. Rafil Dhafir,
p61
aVwho violated the economic sanctions on Iraq by sending medical supplies
p62
aVfor the children there.
p63
aVThey've included people like Yassin Aref.
p64
aVAref and his family fled to New York from Saddam Hussein's Iraq as refugees.
p65
aVHe was arrested in 2004 as part of an FBI sting.
p66
aVAref is an imam and he was asked to bear witness to a loan,
p67
aVwhich is a tradition in Islamic culture.
p68
aVIt turned out that one of the people involved in the loan was trying to enlist
p69
aVsomeone else in a fake attack.
p70
aVAref didn't know.
p71
aVFor that, he was convicted
p72
aVof conspiracy to provide material support to a terrorist group.
p73
aa(lp74
VThe CMUs also include some non-Muslim prisoners.
p75
aVThe guards call them "balancers,"
p76
aVmeaning they help balance out the racial numbers,
p77
aVin hopes of deflecting law suits.
p78
aVThese balancers include animal rights and environmental activists
p79
aVlike Daniel McGowan.
p80
aa(lp81
VMcGowan was convicted of participating in two arsons
p82
aVin the name of defending the environment
p83
aVas part of the Earth Liberation Front.
p84
aVDuring his sentencing, he was afraid that he would be sent
p85
aVto a rumored secret prison for terrorists.
p86
aVThe judge dismissed all those fears,
p87
aVsaying that they weren't supported by any facts.
p88
aVBut that might be because the government hasn't fully explained
p89
aVwhy some prisoners end up in a CMU,
p90
aVand who is responsible for these decisions.
p91
aVWhen McGowan was transferred, he was told
p92
aVit's because he is a "domestic terrorist,"
p93
aVa term the FBI uses repeatedly when talking about environmental activists.
p94
aVNow, keep in mind there are about 400 prisoners in US prisons
p95
aVwho are classified as terrorists,
p96
aVand only a handful of them are in the CMUs.
p97
aVIn McGowan's case, he was previously at a low-security prison
p98
aVand he had no communications violations.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo, why was he moved?
p101
aVLike other CMU prisoners,
p102
aVMcGowan repeatedly asked for an answer, a hearing,
p103
aVor some opportunity for an appeal.
p104
aVThis example from another prisoner shows how those requests are viewed.
p105
aV"Wants a transfer." "Told him no."
p106
aVAt one point, the prison warden himself recommended McGowan's transfer
p107
aVout of the CMU citing his good behavior,
p108
aVbut the warden was overruled
p109
aVby the Bureau of Prison's Counterterrorism Unit,
p110
aVworking with the Joint Terrorism Task Force of the FBI.
p111
aa(lp112
VLater I found out that McGowan was really sent to a CMU
p113
aVnot because of what he did,
p114
aVbut what he has said.
p115
aVA memo from the Counterterrorism Unit cited McGowan's "anti-government beliefs."
p116
aVWhile imprisoned, he continued writing about environmental issues,
p117
aVsaying that activists must reflect on their mistakes
p118
aVand listen to each other.
p119
aVNow, in fairness, if you've spent any time at all in Washington, DC,
p120
aVyou know this is really a radical concept for the government.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VI actually asked to visit McGowan in the CMU.
p125
aVAnd I was approved.
p126
aVThat came as quite a shock.
p127
aVFirst, because as I've discussed on this stage before,
p128
aVI learned that the FBI has been monitoring my work.
p129
aVSecond, because it would make me the first and only journalist to visit a CMU.
p130
aVI had even learned
p131
aVthrough the Bureau of Prisons Counterterrorism Unit,
p132
aVthat they had been monitoring my speeches about CMUs, like this one.
p133
aVSo how could I possibly be approved to visit?
p134
aVA few days before I went out to the prison, I got an answer.
p135
aa(lp136
VI was allowed to visit McGowan as a friend, not a journalist.
p137
aVJournalists are not allowed here.
p138
aVMcGowan was told by CMU officials that if I asked any questions
p139
aVor published any story,
p140
aVthat he would be punished for my reporting.
p141
aVWhen I arrived for our visit, the guards reminded me
p142
aVthat they knew who I was and knew about my work.
p143
aVAnd they said that if I attempted to interview McGowan,
p144
aVthe visit would be terminated.
p145
aVThe Bureau of Prisons describes CMUs as "self-contained housing units."
p146
aVBut I think that's an Orwellian way of describing black holes.
p147
aVWhen you visit a CMU,
p148
aVyou go through all the security checkpoints that you would expect.
p149
aVBut then the walk to the visitation room is silent.
p150
aVWhen a CMU prisoner has a visit, the rest of the prison is on lockdown.
p151
aVI was ushered into a small room,
p152
aVso small my outstretched arms could touch each wall.
p153
aVThere was a grapefruit-sized orb in the ceiling
p154
aVfor the visit to be live-monitored by the Counterterrorism Unit
p155
aVin West Virginia.
p156
aVThe unit insists that all the visits have to be in English for CMU prisoners,
p157
aVwhich is an additional hardship for many of the Muslim families.
p158
aVThere is a thick sheet of foggy, bulletproof glass
p159
aVand on the other side was Daniel McGowan.
p160
aVWe spoke through these handsets attached to the wall
p161
aVand talked about books and movies.
p162
aVWe did our best to find reasons to laugh.
p163
aVTo fight boredom and amuse himself while in the CMU,
p164
aVMcGowan had been spreading a rumor that I was secretly the president
p165
aVof a Twilight fan club in Washington, DC
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VFor the record, I'm not.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aVBut I kind of the hope the FBI now thinks that Bella and Edward
p173
aVare terrorist code names.
p174
aa(lp175
V(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VDuring our visit, McGowan spoke most and at length about his niece Lily,
p178
aVhis wife Jenny and how torturous it feels to never be able to hug them,
p179
aVto never be able to hold their hands.
p180
aVThree months after our visit, McGowan was transferred out of the CMU
p181
aVand then, without warning, he was sent back again.
p182
aVI had published leaked CMU documents on my website
p183
aVand the Counterterrorism Unit said that McGowan had called his wife
p184
aVand asked her to mail them.
p185
aVHe wanted to see what the government was saying about him,
p186
aVand for that he was sent back to the CMU.
p187
aVWhen he was finally released at the end of his sentence,
p188
aVhis story got even more Kafkaesque.
p189
aVHe wrote an article for the Huffington Post headlined,
p190
aV"Court Documents Prove I was Sent to a CMU for my Political Speech."
p191
aa(lp192
VThe next day he was thrown back in jail for his political speech.
p193
aVHis attorneys quickly secured his release,
p194
aVbut the message was very clear:
p195
aVDon't talk about this place.
p196
aa(lp197
VToday, nine years after they were opened by the Bush administration,
p198
aVthe government is codifying how and why CMUs were created.
p199
aVAccording to the Bureau of Prisons,
p200
aVthey are for prisoners with "inspirational significance."
p201
aVI think that is very nice way of saying these are political prisons
p202
aVfor political prisoners.
p203
aa(lp204
VPrisoners are sent to a CMU because of their race,
p205
aVtheir religion or their political beliefs.
p206
aa(lp207
VNow, if you think that characterization is too strong,
p208
aVjust look at some of the government's own documents.
p209
aVWhen some of McGowan's mail was rejected by the CMU, the sender was told
p210
aVit's because the letters were intended "for political prisoners."
p211
aVWhen another prisoner, animal rights activist Andy Stepanian,
p212
aVwas sent to a CMU, it was because of his anti-government and anti-corporate views.
p213
aa(lp214
VNow, I know all of this may be hard to believe,
p215
aVthat it's happening right now, and in the United States.
p216
aVBut the unknown reality is that the US has a dark history
p217
aVof disproportionately punishing people because of their political beliefs.
p218
aVIn the 1960s, before Marion was home to the CMU,
p219
aVit was home to the notorious Control Unit.
p220
aVPrisoners were locked down in solitary for 22 hours a day.
p221
aVThe warden said the unit was to "control revolutionary attitudes."
p222
aVIn the 1980s, another experiment called the Lexington High Security Unit
p223
aVheld women connected to the Weather Underground,
p224
aVBlack Liberation and Puerto Rican independent struggles.
p225
aVThe prison radically restricted communication and used sleep deprivation,
p226
aVand constant light for so-called "ideological conversion."
p227
aVThose prisons were eventually shut down, but only through the campaigning
p228
aVof religious groups and human rights advocates, like Amnesty International.
p229
aa(lp230
VToday, civil rights lawyers with the Center for Constitutional Rights
p231
aVare challenging CMUs in court
p232
aVfor depriving prisoners of their due process rights
p233
aVand for retaliating against them
p234
aVfor their protected political and religious speech.
p235
aVMany of these documents would have never come to light without this lawsuit.
p236
aa(lp237
VThe message of these groups and my message for you today
p238
aVis that we must bear witness to what is being done to these prisoners.
p239
aVTheir treatment is a reflection of the values held beyond prison walls.
p240
aVThis story is not just about prisoners.
p241
aVIt is about us.
p242
aVIt is about our own commitment to human rights.
p243
aVIt is about whether we will choose to stop repeating the mistakes of our past.
p244
aVIf we don't listen to what Father Berrigan described as the stories of the dead,
p245
aVthey will soon become the stories of ourselves.
p246
aa(lp247
VThank you.
p248
aa(lp249
V(Applause)
p250
aa(lp251
V(Applause ends)
p252
aa(lp253
VTom Rielly: I have a couple questions.
p254
aVWhen I was in high school, I learned about the Bill of Rights,
p255
aVthe Constitution, freedom of speech,
p256
aVdue process and  about 25 other laws and rights
p257
aVthat seem to be violated by this.
p258
aVHow could this possibly be happening?
p259
aa(lp260
VWill Potter: I think that's the number one question I get
p261
aVthroughout all of my work,
p262
aVand the short answer is that people don't know.
p263
aVI think the solution to any of these types of situations, any rights abuses,
p264
aVare really dependent on two things.
p265
aVThey're dependent on knowledge that it's actually happening
p266
aVand then a means and efficacy to actually make a change.
p267
aVAnd unfortunately with these prisoners,
p268
aVone, people don't know what's happening at all
p269
aVand then they're already disenfranchised populations
p270
aVwho don't have access to attorneys, not native English speakers.
p271
aVIn some of these cases, they have great representation that I mentioned,
p272
aVbut there's just not a public awareness of what's happening.
p273
aa(lp274
VTR: Isn't it guaranteed in prison that you have right to council
p275
aVor access to council?
p276
aa(lp277
VWP: There's a tendency in our culture
p278
aVto see when people have been convicted of a crime,
p279
aVno matter if that charge was bogus or legitimate,
p280
aVthat whatever happens to them after that is warranted.
p281
aVAnd I think that's a really damaging and dangerous narrative that we have,
p282
aVthat allows these types of things to happen,
p283
aVas the general public just kind of turns a blind eye to it.
p284
aa(lp285
VTR: All those documents on screen were all real documents, word for word,
p286
aVunchanged at all, right?
p287
aa(lp288
VWP: Absolutely. I've actually uploaded all of them to my website.
p289
aVIt's willpotter.com/CMU and it's a footnoted version of the talk,
p290
aVso you can see the documents for yourself without the little snippets.
p291
aVYou can see the full version.
p292
aVI relied overwhelmingly on primary source documents
p293
aVor on primary interviews with former and current prisoners,
p294
aVwith people that are dealing with this situation every day.
p295
aVAnd like I said, I've been there myself, as well.
p296
aa(lp297
VTR: You're doing courageous work.
p298
aa(lp299
VWP: Thank you very much. Thank you all.

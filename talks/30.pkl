VOnce upon a time, there was a dread disease that afflicted children.
p5
aVAnd in fact, among all the diseases that existed in this land,
p6
aVit was the worst. It killed the most children.
p7
aVAnd along came a brilliant inventor, a scientist,
p8
aVwho came up with a partial cure for that disease.
p9
aVAnd it wasn't perfect. Many children still died,
p10
aVbut it was certainly better than what they had before.
p11
aVAnd one of the good things about this cure was that it was free,
p12
aVvirtually free, and was very easy to use.
p13
aVBut the worst thing about it was that you couldn't use it
p14
aVon the youngest children, on infants, and on one-year-olds.
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd so, as a consequence, a few years later,
p17
aVanother scientist \u2014 perhaps maybe this scientist
p18
aVnot quite as brilliant as the one who had preceded him,
p19
aVbut building on the invention of the first one \u2014
p20
aVcame up with a second cure.
p21
aVAnd the beauty of the second cure for this disease
p22
aVwas that it could be used on infants and one-year-olds.
p23
aVAnd the problem with this cure was it was very expensive,
p24
aVand it was very complicated to use.
p25
aVAnd although parents tried as hard as they could to use it properly,
p26
aValmost all of them ended up using it wrong in the end.
p27
aVBut what they did, of course, since it was so complicated and expensive,
p28
aVthey only used it on the zero-year-olds and the one-year-olds.
p29
aVAnd they kept on using the existing cure that they had
p30
aVon the two-year-olds and up.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd this went on for quite some time. People were happy.
p33
aVThey had their two cures. Until a particular mother,
p34
aVwhose child had just turned two, died of this disease.
p35
aVAnd she thought to herself, "My child just turned two,
p36
aVand until the child turned two, I had always used
p37
aVthis complicated, expensive cure, you know, this treatment.
p38
aVAnd then the child turned two, and I started using
p39
aVthe cheap and easy treatment, and I wonder" \u2014
p40
aVand she wondered, like all parents who lose children wonder \u2014
p41
aV"if there isn't something that I could have done,
p42
aVlike keep on using that complicated, expensive cure."
p43
aVAnd she told all the other people, and she said,
p44
aV"How could it possibly be that something
p45
aVthat's cheap and simple works as well as something
p46
aVthat's complicated and expensive?"
p47
aVAnd the people thought, "You know, you're right.
p48
aVIt probably is the wrong thing to do to switch
p49
aVand use the cheap and simple solution."
p50
aVAnd the government, they heard her story and the other people,
p51
aVand they said, "Yeah, you're right, we should make a law.
p52
aVWe should outlaw this cheap and simple treatment
p53
aVand not let anybody use this on their children."
p54
aVAnd the people were happy. They were satisfied.
p55
aa(lp56
VFor many years this went along, and everything was fine.
p57
aVBut then along came a lowly economist, who had children himself,
p58
aVand he used the expensive and complicated treatment.
p59
aVBut he knew about the cheap and simple one.
p60
aVAnd he thought about it, and the expensive one
p61
aVdidn't seem that great to him. So he thought,
p62
aV"I don't know anything about science, but I do know something about data,
p63
aVso maybe I should go and look at the data
p64
aVand see whether this expensive and complicated treatment
p65
aVactually works any better than the cheap and simple one."
p66
aVAnd lo and behold, when he went through the data,
p67
aVhe found that it didn't look like the expensive, complicated
p68
aVsolution was any better than the cheap one,
p69
aVat least for the children who were two and older \u2014
p70
aVthe cheap one still didn't work on the kids who were younger.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd so, he went forth to the people and he said,
p73
aV"I've made this wonderful finding:
p74
aVit looks as if we could just use the cheap and simple solution,
p75
aVand by doing so we could save ourselves 300 million dollars a year,
p76
aVand we could spend that on our children in other ways."
p77
aVAnd the parents were very unhappy, and they said,
p78
aV"This is a terrible thing, because how can the cheap and easy thing
p79
aVbe as good as the hard thing?" And the government was very upset.
p80
aVAnd in particular, the people who made this expensive solution
p81
aVwere very upset because they thought,
p82
aV"How can we hope to compete with something that's essentially free?
p83
aVWe would lose all of our market."
p84
aVAnd people were very angry, and they called him horrible names.
p85
aVAnd he decided that maybe he should leave the country
p86
aVfor a few days, and seek out some more intelligent,
p87
aVopen-minded people in a place called Oxford,
p88
aVand come and try and tell the story at that place.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd so, anyway, here I am. It's not a fairy tale.
p91
aVIt's a true story about the United States today,
p92
aVand the disease I'm referring to is actually
p93
aVmotor vehicle accidents for children.
p94
aVAnd the free cure is adult seatbelts, and the expensive cure \u2014
p95
aVthe 300-million-dollar-a-year cure \u2014 is child car seats.
p96
aVAnd what I'd like to talk to you about today
p97
aVis some of the evidence why I believe this to be true:
p98
aVthat for children two years old and up,
p99
aVthere really is no real benefit \u2014 proven benefit \u2014 of car seats,
p100
aVin spite of the incredible energy
p101
aVthat has been devoted toward expanding the laws
p102
aVand making it socially unacceptable
p103
aVto put your children into seatbelts. And then talk about why \u2014
p104
aVwhat is it that makes that true?
p105
aVAnd then, finally talk a little bit about a third way,
p106
aVabout another technology, which is probably better than anything we have,
p107
aVbut which \u2014 there hasn't been any enthusiasm for adoption
p108
aVprecisely because people are so enamored
p109
aVwith the current car seat solution. OK.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo, many times when you try to do research on data,
p112
aVit records complicated stories \u2014 it's hard to find in the data.
p113
aVIt doesn't turn out to be the case when you look at seatbelts versus car seats.
p114
aVSo the United States keeps a data set
p115
aVof every fatal accident that's happened since 1975.
p116
aVSo in every car crash in which at least one person dies,
p117
aVthey have information on all of the people.
p118
aVSo if you look at that data \u2014 it's right up on the National Highway
p119
aVTransportation Safety Administration's website \u2014
p120
aVyou can just look at the raw data,
p121
aVand begin to get a sense of the limited amount of evidence
p122
aVthat's in favor of car seats for children aged two and up.
p123
aVSo, here is the data. Here I have, among two- to six-year-olds \u2014
p124
aVanyone above six, basically no one uses car seats,
p125
aVso you can't compare \u2014 29.3 percent of the children who are unrestrained
p126
aVin a crash in which at least one person dies, themselves die.
p127
aVIf you put a child in a car seat, 18.2 percent of the children die.
p128
aVIf they're wearing a lap-and-shoulder belt, in this raw data,
p129
aV19.4 percent die. And interestingly, wearing a lap-only seatbelt,
p130
aV16.7 percent die. And actually, the theory tells you
p131
aVthat the lap-only seatbelt's got to be worse
p132
aVthan the lap-and-shoulder belt. And that just reminds you
p133
aVthat when you deal with raw data, there are hundreds
p134
aVof confounding variables that may be getting in the way.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo what we do in the study is \u2014 and this is just presenting
p137
aVthe same information, but turned into a figure to make it easier.
p138
aVSo the yellow bar represents car seats,
p139
aVthe orange bar lap-and-shoulder, and the red bar lap-only seatbelts.
p140
aVAnd this is all relative to unrestrained \u2014
p141
aVthe bigger the bar, the better. Okay.
p142
aVSo, this is the data I just showed, OK?
p143
aVSo the highest bar is what you're striving to beat.
p144
aVSo you can control for the basic things, like how hard the crash was,
p145
aVwhat seat the child was sitting in, etc., the age of the child.
p146
aVAnd that's that middle set of bars.
p147
aVAnd so, you can see that the lap-only seatbelts
p148
aVstart to look worse once you do that.
p149
aVAnd then finally, the last set of bars,
p150
aVwhich are really controlling for everything
p151
aVyou could possibly imagine about the crash,
p152
aV50, 75, 100 different characteristics of the crash.
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd what you find is that the car seats and the lap-and-shoulder belts,
p155
aVwhen it comes to saving lives, fatalities look exactly identical.
p156
aVAnd the standard error bands are relatively small around these estimates as well.
p157
aVAnd it's not just overall. It's very robust
p158
aVto anything you want to look at.
p159
aVOne thing that's interesting: if you look at frontal-impact crashes \u2014
p160
aVwhen the car crashes, the front hits into something \u2014
p161
aVindeed, what you see is that the car seats look a little bit better.
p162
aVAnd I think this isn't just chance.
p163
aVIn order to have the car seat approved,
p164
aVyou need to pass certain federal standards,
p165
aVall of which involve slamming your car into a direct frontal crash.
p166
aVBut when you look at other types of crashes, like rear-impact crashes,
p167
aVindeed, the car seats don't perform as well.
p168
aVAnd I think that's because they've been optimized to pass,
p169
aVas we always expect people to do,
p170
aVto optimize relative to bright-line rules
p171
aVabout how affected the car will be.
p172
aa(lp173
VAnd the other thing you might argue is,
p174
aV"Well, car seats have got a lot better over time.
p175
aVAnd so if we look at recent crashes \u2014
p176
aVthe whole data set is almost 30 years' worth of data \u2014
p177
aVyou won't see it in the recent crashes. The new car seats are far, far better."
p178
aVBut indeed, in recent crashes the lap-and-shoulder seatbelts,
p179
aVactually, are doing even better than the car seats.
p180
aVThey say, "Well, that's impossible, that can't be."
p181
aVAnd the line of argument, if you ask parents, is,
p182
aV"But car seats are so expensive and complicated,
p183
aVand they have this big tangle of latches,
p184
aVhow could they possibly not work better than seatbelts
p185
aVbecause they are so expensive and complicated?"
p186
aVIt's kind of an interesting logic,
p187
aVI think, that people use. And the other logic, they say,
p188
aV"Well, the government wouldn't have told us [to] use them
p189
aVif they weren't much better."
p190
aa(lp191
VBut what's interesting is the government telling us to use them
p192
aVis not actually based on very much.
p193
aVIt really is based on some impassioned pleas of parents
p194
aVwhose children died after they turned two,
p195
aVwhich has led to the passage of all these laws \u2014 not very much on data.
p196
aVSo you can only get so far, I think, in telling your story
p197
aVby using these abstract statistics.
p198
aVAnd so I had some friends over to dinner, and I was asking \u2014
p199
aVwe had a cookout \u2014 I was asking them what advice they might have for me
p200
aVabout proving my point. They said, "Why don't you run some crash tests?"
p201
aVAnd I said, "That's a great idea."
p202
aVSo we actually tried to commission some crash tests.
p203
aVAnd it turns out that as we called around to the independent
p204
aVcrash test companies around the country,
p205
aVnone of them wanted to do our crash test
p206
aVbecause they said, some explicitly, some not so explicitly,
p207
aV"All of our business comes from car seat manufacturers.
p208
aVWe can't risk alienating them by testing seatbelts relative to car seats."
p209
aa(lp210
VNow, eventually, one did. Under the conditions of anonymity,
p211
aVthey said they would be happy to do this test for us \u2014
p212
aVso anonymity, and 1,500 dollars per seat that we crashed.
p213
aVAnd so, we went to Buffalo, New York,
p214
aVand here is the precursor to it.
p215
aVThese are the crash test dummies,
p216
aVwaiting for their chance to take the center stage.
p217
aVAnd then, here's how the crash test works.
p218
aVHere, they don't actually crash the entire car, you know \u2014
p219
aVit's not worth ruining a whole car to do it.
p220
aVSo they just have these bench seats,
p221
aVand they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it.
p222
aVSo I just wanted you to look at this.
p223
aVAnd I think this gives you a good idea of why parents think
p224
aVcar seats are so great. Look at the kid in the car seat.
p225
aVDoes he not look content, ready to go,
p226
aVlike he could survive anything? And then, if you look at the kid in back,
p227
aVit looks like he's already choking before the crash even happens.
p228
aVIt's hard to believe, when you look at this, that
p229
aVthat kid in back is going to do very well when you get in a crash.
p230
aVSo this is going to be a crash
p231
aVwhere they're going to slam this thing forward into a wall
p232
aVat 30 miles an hour, and see what happens. OK?
p233
aa(lp234
VSo, let me show you what happens.
p235
aVThese are three-year-old dummies, by the way.
p236
aVSo here \u2014 this is the car seat. Now watch two things:
p237
aVwatch how the head goes forward,
p238
aVand basically hits the knees \u2014 and this is in the car seat \u2014
p239
aVand watch how the car seat flies around, in the rebound, up in the air.
p240
aVThe car seat's moving all over the place.
p241
aVBear in mind there are two things about this.
p242
aVThis is a car seat that was installed by someone
p243
aVwho has installed 1,000 car seats, who knew exactly how to do it.
p244
aVAnd also it turned out these bench seats
p245
aVare the very best way to install car seats.
p246
aVHaving a flat back makes it much easier to install them.
p247
aVAnd so this is a test that's very much rigged in favor of the car seat,
p248
aVOK? So, that kid in this crash fared very well.
p249
aa(lp250
VThe federal standards are
p251
aVthat you have to score below a 1,000
p252
aVto be an approved car seat on this crash,
p253
aVin some metric of units which are not important.
p254
aVAnd this crash would have been about a 450.
p255
aVSo this car seat was actually an above-average car seat
p256
aVfrom Consumer Reports, and did quite well.
p257
aVSo the next one. Now, this is the kid, same crash,
p258
aVwho is in the seatbelt. He hardly moves at all, actually,
p259
aVrelative to the other child. The funny thing is,
p260
aVthe cam work is terrible because they've only set it up
p261
aVto do the car seats, and so, they actually don't even have a way
p262
aVto move the camera so you can see the kid that's on the rebound.
p263
aVAnyway, it turns out that those two crashes, that actually
p264
aVthe three-year-old did slightly worse. So, he gets about a 500
p265
aVout of \u2014 you know, on this range \u2014 relative to a 400 and something.
p266
aVBut still, if you just took that data from that crash
p267
aVto the federal government, and said, "I have invented a new car seat.
p268
aVI would like you to approve it for selling,"
p269
aVthen they would say, "This is a fantastic new car seat, it works great.
p270
aVIt only got a 500, it could have gotten as high up as a 1,000."
p271
aVAnd this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors
p272
aVinto being approved as a car seat.
p273
aa(lp274
VSo, in some sense, what this is suggesting
p275
aVis that it's not just that people are setting up their car seats wrong,
p276
aVwhich is putting children at risk. It's just that, fundamentally,
p277
aVthe car seats aren't doing much.
p278
aVSo here's the crash. So these are timed at the same time,
p279
aVso you can see that it takes much longer with the car seat \u2014
p280
aVat rebound, it takes a lot longer \u2014
p281
aVbut there's just a lot less movement for child who's in the seatbelt.
p282
aVSo, I'll show you the six-year-old crashes as well.
p283
aVThe six-year-old is in a car seat, and it turns out
p284
aVthat looks terrible, but that's great. That's like a 400, OK?
p285
aVSo that kid would do fine in the crash.
p286
aVNothing about that would have been problematic to the child at all.
p287
aVAnd then here's the six-year-old in the seatbelt,
p288
aVand in fact, they get exactly within, you know,
p289
aVwithin one or two points of the same. So really, for the six-year-old,
p290
aVthe car seat did absolutely nothing whatsoever.
p291
aa(lp292
VThat's some more evidence, so in some sense \u2014
p293
aVI was criticized by a scientist, who said, "You could never publish
p294
aVa study with an n of 4," meaning those four crashes.
p295
aVSo I wrote him back and I said, "What about an n of 45,004?"
p296
aVBecause I had the other 45,000 other real-world crashes.
p297
aVAnd I just think that it's interesting that the idea
p298
aVof using real-world crashes, which is very much something
p299
aVthat economists think would be the right thing to do,
p300
aVis something that scientists don't actually, usually think \u2014
p301
aVthey would rather use a laboratory,
p302
aVa very imperfect science of looking at the dummies,
p303
aVthan actually 30 years of data of what we've seen
p304
aVwith children and with car seats.
p305
aa(lp306
VAnd so I think the answer to this puzzle
p307
aVis that there's a much better solution out there,
p308
aVthat's gotten nobody excited because everyone
p309
aVis so delighted with the way car seats are presumably working.
p310
aVAnd if you think from a design perspective,
p311
aVabout going back to square one, and say,
p312
aV"I just want to protect kids in the back seat."
p313
aVI don't there's anyone in this room who'd say,
p314
aV"Well, the right way to start would be,
p315
aVlet's make a great seat belt for adults.
p316
aVAnd then, let's make this really big contraption
p317
aVthat you have to rig up to it in this daisy chain."
p318
aVI mean, why not start \u2014 who's sitting in the back seat anyway except for kids?
p319
aVBut essentially, do something like this,
p320
aVwhich I don't know exactly how much it would cost to do,
p321
aVbut there's no reason I could see
p322
aVwhy this should be much more expensive than a regular car seat.
p323
aVIt's just actually \u2014 you see, this is folding up \u2014 it's behind the seat.
p324
aVYou've got a regular seat for adults, and then you fold it down,
p325
aVand the kid sits on top, and it's integrated.
p326
aVIt seems to me that this can't be a very expensive solution,
p327
aVand it's got to work better than what we already have.
p328
aa(lp329
VSo the question is, is there any hope for adoption of something like this,
p330
aVwhich would presumably save a lot of lives?
p331
aVAnd I think the answer, perhaps, lies in a story.
p332
aVThe answer both to why has a car seat been so successful,
p333
aVand why this may someday be adopted or not,
p334
aVlies in a story that my dad told me, relating to when he was a doctor
p335
aVin the U.S. Air Force in England. And this is a long time ago:
p336
aVyou were allowed to do things then you can't do today.
p337
aVSo, my father would have patients come in
p338
aVwho he thought were not really sick.
p339
aVAnd he had a big jar full of placebo pills that he would give them,
p340
aVand he'd say, "Come back in a week, if you still feel lousy."
p341
aVOK, and most of them would not come back,
p342
aVbut some of them would come back.
p343
aVAnd when they came back, he, still convinced they were not sick,
p344
aVhad another jar of pills. In this jar were huge horse pills.
p345
aVThey were almost impossible to swallow.
p346
aVAnd these, to me, are the analogy for the car seats.
p347
aVPeople would look at these and say, "Man, this thing is so big
p348
aVand so hard to swallow. If this doesn't make me feel better,
p349
aVyou know, what possibly could?"
p350
aa(lp351
VAnd it turned out that most people wouldn't come back,
p352
aVbecause it worked. But every once in a while,
p353
aVthere was still a patient convinced that he was sick,
p354
aVand he'd come back. And my dad had a third jar of pills.
p355
aVAnd the jar of pills he had, he said,
p356
aVwere the tiniest little pills he could find,
p357
aVso small you could barely see them.
p358
aVAnd he would say, listen, I know I gave you that huge pill,
p359
aVthat complicated, hard-to-swallow pill before,
p360
aVbut now I've got one that's so potent,
p361
aVthat is really tiny and small and almost invisible.
p362
aVIt's almost like this thing here, which you can't even see."
p363
aa(lp364
VAnd it turned out that never,
p365
aVin all the times my dad gave out this pill, the really tiny pill,
p366
aVdid anyone ever come back still complaining of sickness.
p367
aVSo, my dad always took that as evidence
p368
aVthat this little, teeny, powerful pill
p369
aVhad the ultimate placebo effect. And in some sense, if that's the right story,
p370
aVI think integrated car seats you will see, very quickly,
p371
aVbecoming something that everyone has. The other possible conclusion
p372
aVis, well, maybe after coming to my father three times,
p373
aVgetting sent home with placebos, he still felt sick,
p374
aVhe went and found another doctor.
p375
aVAnd that's completely possible. And if that's the case,
p376
aVthen I think we're stuck with conventional car seats for a long time to come.
p377
aVThank you very much.
p378
aa(lp379

V(Audience: I just wanted to ask you, when we wear seatbelts
p382
aVwe don't necessarily wear them just to prevent loss of life,
p383
aVit's also to prevent lots of serious injury.
p384
aVYour data looks at fatalities. It doesn't look at serious injury.
p385
aVIs there any data to show that child seats
p386
aVare actually less effective, or just as effective as seatbelts
p387
aVfor serious injury? Because that would prove your case.)
p388
aa(lp389
VSteven Levitt: Yeah, that's a great question. In my data, and in another data set
p390
aVI've looked at for New Jersey crashes,
p391
aVI find very small differences in injury.
p392
aVSo in this data, it's statistically insignificant differences
p393
aVin injury between car seats and lap-and-shoulder belts.
p394
aVIn the New Jersey data, which is different,
p395
aVbecause it's not just fatal crashes,
p396
aVbut all crashes in New Jersey that are reported,
p397
aVit turns out that there is a 10 percent difference in injuries,
p398
aVbut generally they're the minor injuries.
p399
aVNow, what's interesting, I should say this as a disclaimer,
p400
aVthere is medical literature that is very difficult to resolve with this other data,
p401
aVwhich suggests that car seats are dramatically better.
p402
aa(lp403
VAnd they use a completely different methodology that involves \u2014
p404
aVafter the crash occurs, they get from the insurance companies
p405
aVthe names of the people who were in the crash,
p406
aVand they call them on the phone,
p407
aVand they asked them what happened.
p408
aVAnd I really can't resolve, yet,
p409
aVand I'd like to work with these medical researchers
p410
aVto try to understand how there can be these differences,
p411
aVwhich are completely at odds with one another.
p412
aVBut it's obviously a critical question.
p413
aVThe question is even if \u2014 are there enough serious injuries
p414
aVto make these cost-effective? It's kind of tricky.
p415
aVEven if they're right, it's not so clear
p416
aVthat they're so cost-effective.

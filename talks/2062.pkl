VWhen my first children's book was published
p5
aVin 2001,
p6
aVI returned to my old elementary school
p7
aVto talk to the students about being an author
p8
aVand an illustrator,
p9
aVand when I was setting up my slide projector
p10
aVin the cafetorium,
p11
aVI looked across the room,
p12
aVand there she was:
p13
aVmy old lunch lady.
p14
aVShe was still there at the school
p15
aVand she was busily preparing lunches for the day.
p16
aVSo I approached her to say hello,
p17
aVand I said, "Hi, Jeannie! How are you?"
p18
aVAnd she looked at me, and I could tell
p19
aVthat she recognized me,
p20
aVbut she couldn't quite place me, and she looked at me and she said,
p21
aV"Stephen Krosoczka?"
p22
aVAnd I was amazed that she knew I was a Krosoczka,
p23
aVbut Stephen is my uncle who is 20 years older than I am,
p24
aVand she had been his lunch lady when he was a kid.
p25
aVAnd she started telling me about her grandkids,
p26
aVand that blew my mind.
p27
aVMy lunch lady had grandkids,
p28
aVand therefore kids,
p29
aVand therefore left school at the end of the day?
p30
aVI thought she lived in the cafeteria
p31
aVwith the serving spoons.
p32
aVI had never thought about any of that before.
p33
aa(lp34
VWell, that chance encounter inspired my imagination,
p35
aVand I created the Lunch Lady graphic novel series,
p36
aVa series of comics about a lunch lady
p37
aVwho uses her fish stick nunchucks
p38
aVto fight off evil cyborg substitutes,
p39
aVa school bus monster, and mutant mathletes,
p40
aVand the end of every book,
p41
aVthey get the bad guy with their hairnet,
p42
aVand they proclaim, "Justice is served!"
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd it's been amazing, because the series
p47
aVwas so welcomed into the reading lives of children,
p48
aVand they sent me the most amazing letters
p49
aVand cards and artwork.
p50
aVAnd I would notice as I would visit schools,
p51
aVthe lunch staff would be involved in the programming
p52
aVin a very meaningful way.
p53
aVAnd coast to coast,
p54
aVall of the lunch ladies told me the same thing:
p55
aV"Thank you for making a superhero in our likeness."
p56
aVBecause the lunch lady has not been treated
p57
aVvery kindly in popular culture over time.
p58
aVBut it meant the most to Jeannie.
p59
aVWhen the books were first published,
p60
aVI invited her to the book launch party,
p61
aVand in front of everyone there,
p62
aVeveryone she had fed over the years,
p63
aVI gave her a piece of artwork and some books.
p64
aVAnd two years after this photo was taken,
p65
aVshe passed away,
p66
aVand I attended her wake,
p67
aVand nothing could have prepared me for what I saw there,
p68
aVbecause next to her casket was this painting,
p69
aVand her husband told me it meant so much to her
p70
aVthat I had acknowledged her hard work,
p71
aVI had validated what she did.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd that inspired me to create a day
p74
aVwhere we could recreate that feeling
p75
aVin cafeterias across the country:
p76
aVSchool Lunch Hero Day, a day where kids
p77
aVcan make creative projects for their lunch staff.
p78
aVAnd I partnered with the School Nutrition Association,
p79
aVand did you know that a little over 30 million kids
p80
aVparticipate in school lunch programs every day.
p81
aVThat equals up to a little over five billion lunches
p82
aVmade every school year.
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd the stories of heroism go well beyond
p85
aVjust a kid getting a few extra chicken nuggets
p86
aVon their lunch tray.
p87
aVThere is Ms. Brenda in California,
p88
aVwho keeps a close eye on every student that comes through her line
p89
aVand then reports back to the guidance counselor
p90
aVif anything is amiss.
p91
aVThere are the lunch ladies in Kentucky
p92
aVwho realized that 67 percent of their students
p93
aVrelied on those meals every day,
p94
aVand they were going without food over the summer,
p95
aVso they retrofitted a school bus
p96
aVto create a mobile feeding unit,
p97
aVand they traveled around the neighborhoods
p98
aVfeedings 500 kids a day during the summer.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd kids made the most amazing projects.
p101
aVI knew they would.
p102
aVKids made hamburger cards
p103
aVthat were made out of construction paper.
p104
aVThey took photos of their lunch lady's head
p105
aVand plastered it onto my cartoon lunch lady
p106
aVand fixed that to a milk carton
p107
aVand presented them with flowers.
p108
aVAnd they made their own comics,
p109
aVstarring the cartoon lunch lady
p110
aValongside their actual lunch ladies.
p111
aVAnd they made thank you pizzas,
p112
aVwhere every kid signed a different topping
p113
aVof a construction paper pizza.
p114
aa(lp115
VFor me, I was so moved by the response
p116
aVthat came from the lunch ladies,
p117
aVbecause one woman said to me, she said,
p118
aV"Before this day, I felt like I was
p119
aVat the end of the planet at this school.
p120
aVI didn't think that anyone noticed us down here."
p121
aVAnother woman said to me,
p122
aV"You know, what I got out of this
p123
aVis that what I do is important."
p124
aa(lp125
VAnd of course what she does is important.
p126
aVWhat they all do is important.
p127
aVThey're feeding our children every single day,
p128
aVand before a child can learn,
p129
aVtheir belly needs to be full,
p130
aVand these women and men
p131
aVare working on the front lines to create
p132
aVan educated society.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo I hope that
p135
aVyou don't wait for School Lunch Hero Day
p136
aVto say thank you to your lunch staff,
p137
aVand I hope that you remember
p138
aVhow powerful a thank you can be.
p139
aVA thank you can change a life.
p140
aVIt changes the life of the person who receives it,
p141
aVand it changes the life of the person
p142
aVwho expresses it.
p143
aa(lp144
VThank you.
p145

VChris has been so nice.
p5
aVI don't know how you keep it up, Chris, I really don't.
p6
aVSo nice, all week. He's the kind of man you could say to,
p7
aV"Chris, I'm really sorry, I've crashed your car.
p8
aVAnd it gets worse, I crashed it into your house.
p9
aVYour house has caught fire.
p10
aVAnd what's more, your wife has just run off with your best friend."
p11
aa(lp12
VAnd you know that Chris would say, "Thank you."
p13
aV(Laughter)
p14
aV"Thank you for sharing, that's really interesting."
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aV"Thank you for taking me to a place that I didn't know existed. Thank you."
p17
aV(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VOne of the \u2014 (Applause) Thank you for inviting us.
p20
aVOne of the things about appearing later on in the TED week is that,
p21
aVgradually, as the days go by,
p22
aVall the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say.
p23
aV(Laughter)
p24
aVNuclear fusion, I had about 10 minutes on that.
p25
aVSpectroscopy, that was another one.
p26
aVParallel universes.
p27
aVAnd so this morning I thought, "Oh well, I'll just do a card trick."
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aVThat one's gone as well.
p30
aVAnd today is Emmanuel's day, I think we've agreed that, already, haven't we?
p31
aVEmmanuel? Absolutely. (Applause)
p32
aVI was planning on finishing on a dance ...
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVSo, that's going to look pretty shabby now.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo, what I thought I'd do is \u2014 in honor of Emmanuel \u2014
p37
aVis, what I can do is to launch today the first
p38
aVTED Global auction.
p39
aVIf I could start, this is the Enigma decoding machine.
p40
aV(Laughter)
p41
aVWho will start me with $1,000? Anyone?
p42
aa(lp43
VThank you. Bruno's face, just then,
p44
aVhe said, "No, don't go through this. Don't, please don't.
p45
aVDon't go through this. Don't do it."
p46
aV(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VI'm worried. When I first got the invitation,
p49
aVthey said somewhere in the thing, they said, "15 minutes to change the world,
p50
aVyour moment onstage." 15 minutes to change the world.
p51
aVI don't know about you, it takes me 15 minutes to change a plug.
p52
aV(Laughter)
p53
aVSo, the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one.
p54
aVWell, of course now we know we don't have to change a plug,
p55
aVnow we've seen that wonderful demonstration
p56
aVof the wireless electric \u2014 fantastic. You know, it inspires us.
p57
aV300 years ago he'd have been burnt at the stake for that.
p58
aV(Laughter)
p59
aVAnd now it's an idea.
p60
aV(Laughter)
p61
aVIt's great. It's fantastic.
p62
aVBut you do meet some fantastic people,
p63
aVpeople who look at the world in a totally different way.
p64
aa(lp65
VYesterday, David Deutsch, another one
p66
aVwho covered most of what I was going to say.
p67
aV(Laughter)
p68
aVBut when you think of the world in that way,
p69
aVit does make going to Starbucks a whole new experience, don't you think?
p70
aVI mean, he must walk in and they will say,
p71
aV"Would you like a macchiato,
p72
aVor a latte, or an Americano,
p73
aVor a cappuccino?"
p74
aVAnd he'll say,
p75
aV"You're offering me things that are infinitely variable."
p76
aV(Laughter)
p77
aV"How can your coffee be true?"
p78
aV(Laughter)
p79
aVAnd they will say,
p80
aV"Would you mind if I serve the next customer?"
p81
aV(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd Elaine Morgan yesterday, wasn't she wonderful?
p84
aVFantastic. Really good.
p85
aVHer talk about the aquatic ape, and the link, of course,
p86
aVthe link between Darwinism
p87
aVand the fact that we are all naked beneath this \u2014
p88
aVwe're not hirsute and we can swim rather well.
p89
aVAnd she said, you know, she's 90. She's running out of time, she said.
p90
aVAnd she's desperate to find more evidence for the link.
p91
aVAnd I think, "I'm sitting next to Lewis Pugh."
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aVThis man has swum around the North Pole, what more evidence do you want?
p94
aV(Laughter)
p95
aVAnd there he is.
p96
aV(Applause)
p97
aVThat's how TED brings these connections together.
p98
aa(lp99
VI wasn't here on Tuesday. I didn't actually see Gordon Brown's
p100
aVjob application \u2014 um, sorry.
p101
aV(Laughter)
p102
aVI'm so sorry. (Applause)
p103
aVI'm so sorry. No, no. (Applause)
p104
aVNo, no, ahh ... (Applause)
p105
aV(As Brown): "Global problems require Scottish solutions."
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aVThe problem I have is because Gordon Brown, he comes onstage
p108
aVand he looks for all the world like a man
p109
aVwho's just taken the head off a bear suit.
p110
aa(lp111
V(As Brown): "Hello, can I tell you what happened in the woods back there?
p112
aVUh, no." (Laughter)
p113
aV"I'm sorry. I've only got 18 minutes, 18 minutes to talk about saving the world,
p114
aVsaving the planet, global institutions.
p115
aVOur work on climate change,
p116
aVI've only got 18 minutes, unfortunately I'm not able to tell you about
p117
aVall the wonderful things we're doing to promote the climate change agenda
p118
aVin Great Britain,
p119
aVlike the third runway we're planning at Heathrow Airport ..."
p120
aV(Laughter)
p121
aV"The large coal-fired power station we're building
p122
aVat King's North,
p123
aVand of course the exciting news that only today,
p124
aVonly this week, Britain's only manufacturer
p125
aVof wind turbines has been forced to close.
p126
aVNo time, unfortunately,
p127
aVto mention those."
p128
aV(Applause)
p129
aV"British jobs for Scottish people ...
p130
aVNo." (Laughter)
p131
aV"Christian principles, Christian values.
p132
aVThou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal,
p133
aVthou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife."
p134
aV(Laughter)
p135
aV"Although to be honest, when I was at Number 11 that was never going to be a problem."
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
V(As Tony Blair): "Yeah, alright, come on, eh.
p139
aVAlright Gordon, come on, eh.
p140
aVI just, can I just say a few things about,
p141
aVfirst about Cherie, because she's a wonderful lady,
p142
aVmy wife, with a wonderful smile.
p143
aVThat reminds me, I must post that letter."
p144
aV(Laughter)
p145
aV"I just think, you know, what people forget,
p146
aVGordon and I, we always got on perfectly well.
p147
aVAlright, it was never exactly 'Brokeback Mountain.'"
p148
aV(Laughter)
p149
aV"You know, I wrote to him, just before I left office. I said,
p150
aV'Can I rely on your support for the next month?'
p151
aVAnd he wrote back. He said, 'No, you can't.'
p152
aVWhich kind of surprised me, because I'd never seen 'can't' spelled that way before."
p153
aV(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VAnother thing Gordon could have mentioned in his speech
p156
aVto the Mansion House in 2002 \u2014
p157
aVthat was to the building; the people weren't listening.
p158
aVBut the people, when talking about the finance industry, he said,
p159
aV"What you as the city of London have done for financial services,
p160
aVwe, as a government, hope to do for the economy as a whole."
p161
aV(Laughter)
p162
aVWhen you think what's happened to financial services,
p163
aVand you see what's happened to the economy, you think,
p164
aV"Well, there is a man who delivers on his promises."
p165
aV(Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
VBut we're in a new world now. We're in a completely new world.
p168
aVThis is the first time that I can remember, where if you get a letter
p169
aVfrom the bank manager about a loan, you don't know if you're borrowing
p170
aVmoney from him, or if he's borrowing money from you.
p171
aVAm I right?
p172
aa(lp173
VThese extraordinary things, Icelandic Internet accounts.
p174
aVDid anyone here have an Icelandic Internet account?
p175
aVWhy would you do that? Why would \u2014 It's like one step up
p176
aVfrom replying to one of those emails from Nigeria, isn't it?
p177
aV(Laughter)
p178
aVAsking for your bank details.
p179
aVAnd, you know, Iceland, it was never going to cut it.
p180
aVIt didn't have that kind of collateral.
p181
aVWhat does it have? It has fish, that's all.
p182
aVThat's why the Prime Minister went on television. He said,
p183
aV"This has left us all
p184
aVwith a very big haddock."
p185
aV(Laughter)
p186
aa(lp187
VA lot of what I do \u2014 I have to try and make sense
p188
aVof things before I can make nonsense of them.
p189
aVAnd making sense of the financial crisis is very, very difficult.
p190
aVLuckily, somebody like George Bush was really helpful.
p191
aVHe summed it up, really, at a dinner.
p192
aVHe was speaking at a dinner, he said,
p193
aV"Wall Street got drunk."
p194
aV(Laughter)
p195
aV"And now it's got a hangover."
p196
aVAnd that's, you know, that's something \u2014
p197
aV(Applause)
p198
aVAnd that's something we can relate to.
p199
aVIt's certainly something he can relate to.
p200
aV(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd the other one, of course, is Donald Rumsfeld, who said,
p203
aV"There are the known knowns, the things we know we know.
p204
aVAnd then you got the known unknowns,
p205
aVthe things we know we don't know.
p206
aVAnd then you got the unknown unknowns, those are the things
p207
aVwe don't know we don't know."
p208
aVAnd being English, when I first heard that I thought, "What a load of cock."
p209
aVAnd then, you're now, well, actually, that's what this is about.
p210
aa(lp211
VThis whole, what Ben Bernanke has said,
p212
aVthe chaotic unwinding of the world's financial system,
p213
aVit's about \u2014 they don't know, they didn't know what they were doing.
p214
aVIn 2006, the head of the American Mortgage Bankers Association said, quote,
p215
aV"As we can clearly see,
p216
aVno seismic occurrence
p217
aVis about to overwhelm the U.S. economy."
p218
aVNow, there is a man on top of his job.
p219
aV(Laughter)
p220
aVAnd when the crisis was happening, the head of quantitative equities
p221
aVat Lehman Brothers said,
p222
aV"Events which models predicted would happen
p223
aVonce every 10,000 years
p224
aVhappened every day for three days."
p225
aa(lp226
VSo, it's extraordinary. It's a new world that's very, very difficult to make sense of.
p227
aVBut we have a new hope. We have a new man.
p228
aVAmerica has now elected its first openly black President.
p229
aV(Laughter)
p230
aVWonderful news.
p231
aVNot only that, he's left-handed. Have you noticed this?
p232
aVHow many people here are left-handed?
p233
aVYou see, a lot of the people that I most admire,
p234
aVthey're great artists, great designers, great thinkers,
p235
aVthey're left-handed.
p236
aVAnd somebody said to me last night, you know, being left-handed,
p237
aVyou have to learn to write without smudging the ink.
p238
aVAnd somebody was talking about metaphors on Monday.
p239
aVAnd I thought, what a wonderful metaphor, isn't it? An American President who
p240
aVhas to write without smudging the ink.
p241
aa(lp242
VYou like that one? As opposed to you could see
p243
aVGeorge Bush, well, what's the metaphor there?
p244
aVI think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing, wouldn't it?
p245
aV"Well, you know I'm sorry about that.
p246
aVI'm right-handed but I seem to have smudged that ink as well."
p247
aV(Laughter)
p248
aVBut, you know, he's gone. Now he's gone.
p249
aVThat's eight years of American History, eight minutes of my act,
p250
aVjust gone like that.
p251
aa(lp252
V"You know, it's the end of an error [sic].
p253
aVI happen to believe it was a great error.
p254
aVI know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors
p255
aVin the history of the United States.
p256
aVBut we proved them wrong in Iraq.
p257
aVThey said there was no link between Iraq and Al Qaeda.
p258
aVThere is now."
p259
aV(Laughter)
p260
aV"But I have a message for the suicide bombers,
p261
aVfor those people who've blown themselves up."
p262
aV(Laughter)
p263
aV"We're going to find you."
p264
aV(Laughter)
p265
aV"We're going to make sure you don't do it again."
p266
aV(Laughter)
p267
aa(lp268
VBut now he's gone, and it's great to see one of the \u2014
p269
aVarguably one of the worst speech makers
p270
aVin American history,
p271
aVnow given way to one of the greatest, in Obama.
p272
aVYou were there, maybe, on the night of his victory.
p273
aVAnd he spoke to the crowd in Chicago, he said,
p274
aV"If there is anyone out there
p275
aVwho still doubts
p276
aVthat America is a place
p277
aVwhere all things are possible ..."
p278
aVI can't do the whole thing because it would take too long, it really would.
p279
aV(Laughter)
p280
aVBut you get the picture. And then it goes to the inauguration.
p281
aVAnd he and the Chief Justice, they trip over each other,
p282
aVthey get their words wrong and they screw the thing up.
p283
aVAnd there is George Bush sitting there going, "Heh heh heh heh ..."
p284
aV(Laughter)
p285
aV"Not so easy is it? Heh heh heh."
p286
aV(Laughter)
p287
aa(lp288
VBut the interesting thing is, Gordon Brown was talking about Cicero,
p289
aVwho said, people would listen to a speech, they said, "Great speech."
p290
aVAnd then they'd listen to Demosthenes,
p291
aVand they'd say, "Let's march."
p292
aVAnd we all want to believe in President Obama.
p293
aVIt's rather like that line in the film "As Good As it Gets."
p294
aVDo you remember that film with Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson,
p295
aVand Helen Hunt says to Jack Nicholson, "What do you see in me?"
p296
aVAnd Jack Nicholson just says,
p297
aV"You make me want to be a better man."
p298
aa(lp299
VAnd you want a leader who inspires and challenges
p300
aVand makes you want to be a better citizen. Right?
p301
aVBut at the moment, it's a Cicero thing.
p302
aVWe like what Barack Obama says, but we don't do anything about it.
p303
aVSo he comes over to this country, and he says,
p304
aV"We need
p305
aVa big fiscal stimulus."
p306
aVAnd everyone goes, "Great!" He leaves the country
p307
aVand the French and the Germans go, "No, no, forget about that,
p308
aVabsolutely not." Nothing happens. He goes to Strasburg.
p309
aVHe says, "We need more boots on the ground in Afghanistan."
p310
aVAnd everyone goes, "Great idea."
p311
aVHe leaves, people go, "No no no, we're not going to do that.
p312
aV5,000 maximum, and no rockets. No, no, not going to do it."
p313
aVHe goes to Prague, he says, "We believe in a nuclear-free world."
p314
aa(lp315
VAnd it's great to have an American president who can say the word "nuclear,"
p316
aVlet's just point that out first.
p317
aVDo you remember that? George Bush, "A nu-ca-ler."
p318
aVSorry, what? "A nu-ca-ler."
p319
aV(Laughter)
p320
aVCould you say "avuncular"? "Avunclear."
p321
aV(Laughter)
p322
aVThank you very much.
p323
aa(lp324
VBut he says, "We want a nuclear-free world."
p325
aVAnd that day, North Korea, that very day,
p326
aVNorth Korea is just seeing if it can
p327
aVjust get one over Japan \u2014
p328
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p329
aVand land it before ...
p330
aa(lp331
VSo, where do we look for inspiration? We've still got Bill Clinton.
p332
aV"Travels the world." (Laughs)
p333
aV"I believe, I believe it was President Dwight D. Eisenhower who said ..."
p334
aV(Laughter)
p335
aV"Tell a lie; it was Diana Ross ..."
p336
aV(Laughter)
p337
aV"... who said, reach out and touch ..."
p338
aV(Laughter)
p339
aV"... somebody's gla \u2014 hand."
p340
aV(Laughter)
p341
aV"Make this world a better place, if you can.
p342
aVI just think that's important. I really do.
p343
aVAnd I was hoping Hillary would get to the White House,
p344
aVbecause she'd have been out of our home for four years.
p345
aVAnd I, you know." (Laughter)
p346
aV"So, when that didn't work out I had to make a few arrangements, let me tell you."
p347
aV(Laughter)
p348
aa(lp349
VSo, there's him. In Britain we have Prince Charles:
p350
aV"And the environment is so important, all we can do.
p351
aVMy wife gets fed up with me constantly trying to
p352
aVpush emissions up her agenda."
p353
aV(Laughter)
p354
aa(lp355
VOr, any South Africans, we have Mandela to inspire.
p356
aVMandela, the great man Mandela.
p357
aVHe's been honored with a statue now.
p358
aVThe previous highest honor he had in Britain
p359
aVwas a visit from the team from Ground Force, a gardening program.
p360
aV"So, Nelson, how would you like a nice water feature?"
p361
aV"Ahh, listen to me Mr. Titchmarsh."
p362
aV(Laughter)
p363
aV"I was held in prison
p364
aVfor nearly 30 years
p365
aVon an island
p366
aVin the middle of the ocean.
p367
aVWhy would I need a bloody water feature?"
p368
aV(Laughter)
p369
aa(lp370
VVery quickly: I wasn't quite sure how to end this talk
p371
aVand then yesterday that man came up with a wonderful quote
p372
aVfrom the "Japanese Essays on Idleness"
p373
aVwhich said it's nice to have something which is unfinished
p374
aVbecause it implies there is still room for growth.
p375
aVThank you very much indeed.

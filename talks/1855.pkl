VHave you ever asked yourselves why it is that
p5
aVcompanies, the really cool companies,
p6
aVthe innovative ones, the creative,
p7
aVnew economy-type companies \u2014
p8
aVApple, Google, Facebook \u2014
p9
aVare coming out of one particular country,
p10
aVthe United States of America?
p11
aVUsually when I say this, someone says, "Spotify!
p12
aVThat's Europe." But, yeah.
p13
aVIt has not had the impact that these other companies have had.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow what I do is I'm an economist,
p16
aVand I actually study the relationship
p17
aVbetween innovation and economic growth
p18
aVat the level of the company, the industry and the nation,
p19
aVand I work with policymakers worldwide,
p20
aVespecially in the European Commission,
p21
aVbut recently also in interesting places like China,
p22
aVand I can tell you that that question
p23
aVis on the tip of all of their tongues:
p24
aVWhere are the European Googles?
p25
aVWhat is the secret behind the Silicon Valley growth model,
p26
aVwhich they understand is different
p27
aVfrom this old economy growth model?
p28
aVAnd what is interesting is that often,
p29
aVeven if we're in the 21st century,
p30
aVwe kind of come down in the end to these ideas
p31
aVof market versus state.
p32
aVIt's talked about in these modern ways,
p33
aVbut the idea is that somehow, behind places like Silicon Valley,
p34
aVthe secret have been different types of market-making mechanisms,
p35
aVthe private initiative, whether this be about
p36
aVa dynamic venture capital sector
p37
aVthat's actually able to provide that high-risk finance
p38
aVto these innovative companies,
p39
aVthe gazelles as we often call them,
p40
aVwhich traditional banks are scared of,
p41
aVor different types of really successful
p42
aVcommercialization policies which actually allow these companies
p43
aVto bring these great inventions, their products,
p44
aVto the market and actually get over this
p45
aVreally scary Death Valley period
p46
aVin which many companies instead fail.
p47
aa(lp48
VBut what really interests me, especially nowadays
p49
aVand because of what's happening politically around the world,
p50
aVis the language that's used, the narrative,
p51
aVthe discourse, the images, the actual words.
p52
aVSo we often are presented
p53
aVwith the kind of words like that the private sector
p54
aVis also much more innovative because it's able to
p55
aVthink out of the box.
p56
aVThey are more dynamic.
p57
aVThink of Steve Jobs' really inspirational speech
p58
aVto the 2005 graduating class at Stanford,
p59
aVwhere he said to be innovative,
p60
aVyou've got to stay hungry, stay foolish.
p61
aVRight? So these guys are kind of the hungry
p62
aVand foolish and colorful guys, right?
p63
aVAnd in places like Europe,
p64
aVit might be more equitable,
p65
aVwe might even be a bit better dressed
p66
aVand eat better than the U.S.,
p67
aVbut the problem is this damn public sector.
p68
aVIt's a bit too big, and it hasn't actually allowed
p69
aVthese things like dynamic venture capital
p70
aVand commercialization to actually be able to really
p71
aVbe as fruitful as it could.
p72
aVAnd even really respectable newspapers,
p73
aVsome that I'm actually subscribed to,
p74
aVthe words they use are, you know,
p75
aVthe state as this Leviathan. Right?
p76
aVThis monster with big tentacles.
p77
aVThey're very explicit in these editorials.
p78
aVThey say, "You know, the state, it's necessary
p79
aVto fix these little market failures
p80
aVwhen you have public goods
p81
aVor different types of negative externalities like pollution,
p82
aVbut you know what, what is the next big revolution
p83
aVgoing to be after the Internet?
p84
aVWe all hope it might be something green,
p85
aVor all of this nanotech stuff, and in order for that stuff to happen," they say \u2014
p86
aVthis was a special issue on the next industrial revolution \u2014
p87
aVthey say, "the state, just stick to the basics, right?
p88
aVFund the infrastructure. Fund the schools.
p89
aVEven fund the basic research, because this is
p90
aVpopularly recognized, in fact, as a big public good
p91
aVwhich private companies don't want to invest in,
p92
aVdo that, but you know what?
p93
aVLeave the rest to the revolutionaries."
p94
aVThose colorful, out-of-the-box kind of thinkers.
p95
aVThey're often called garage tinkerers,
p96
aVbecause some of them actually did some things in garages,
p97
aVeven though that's partly a myth.
p98
aVAnd so what I want to do with you in, oh God,
p99
aVonly 10 minutes,
p100
aVis to really think again this juxtaposition,
p101
aVbecause it actually has massive, massive implications
p102
aVbeyond innovation policy,
p103
aVwhich just happens to be the area
p104
aVthat I often talk with with policymakers.
p105
aVIt has huge implications, even with this whole notion
p106
aVthat we have on where, when and why
p107
aVwe should actually be cutting back on public spending
p108
aVand different types of public services which,
p109
aVof course, as we know, are increasingly being
p110
aVoutsourced because of this juxtaposition.
p111
aVRight? I mean, the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools
p112
aVis in order to make them more innovative without being emburdened
p113
aVby this heavy hand of the state curriculum, or something.
p114
aVSo these kind of words are constantly,
p115
aVthese juxtapositions come up everywhere,
p116
aVnot just with innovation policy.
p117
aa(lp118
VAnd so to think again,
p119
aVthere's no reason that you should believe me,
p120
aVso just think of some of the smartest
p121
aVrevolutionary things that you have in your pockets
p122
aVand do not turn it on, but you might want to take it out, your iPhone.
p123
aVAsk who actually funded the really cool,
p124
aVrevolutionary thinking-out-of-the-box
p125
aVthings in the iPhone.
p126
aVWhat actually makes your phone
p127
aVa smartphone, basically, instead of a stupid phone?
p128
aVSo the Internet, which you can surf the web
p129
aVanywhere you are in the world;
p130
aVGPS, where you can actually know where you are
p131
aVanywhere in the world;
p132
aVthe touchscreen display, which makes it also
p133
aVa really easy-to-use phone for anybody.
p134
aVThese are the very smart, revolutionary bits about the iPhone,
p135
aVand they're all government-funded.
p136
aVAnd the point is that the Internet
p137
aVwas funded by DARPA, U.S. Department of Defense.
p138
aVGPS was funded by the military's Navstar program.
p139
aVEven Siri was actually funded by DARPA.
p140
aVThe touchscreen display was funded
p141
aVby two public grants by the CIA and the NSF
p142
aVto two public university researchers at the University of Delaware.
p143
aVNow, you might be thinking, "Well, she's just said
p144
aVthe word 'defense' and 'military' an awful lot,"
p145
aVbut what's really interesting is that this is actually true
p146
aVin sector after sector and department after department.
p147
aVSo the pharmaceutical industry, which I am personally
p148
aVvery interested in because I've actually had the fortune
p149
aVto study it in quite some depth,
p150
aVis wonderful to be asking this question
p151
aVabout the revolutionary versus non-revolutionary bits,
p152
aVbecause each and every medicine can actually be
p153
aVdivided up on whether it really is revolutionary or incremental.
p154
aVSo the new molecular entities with priority rating
p155
aVare the revolutionary new drugs,
p156
aVwhereas the slight variations of existing drugs \u2014
p157
aVViagra, different color, different dosage \u2014
p158
aVare the less revolutionary ones.
p159
aVAnd it turns out that a full 75 percent
p160
aVof the new molecular entities with priority rating
p161
aVare actually funded in boring, Kafka-ian public sector labs.
p162
aVThis doesn't mean that Big Pharma is not spending on innovation.
p163
aVThey do. They spend on the marketing part.
p164
aVThey spend on the D part of R&D.
p165
aVThey spend an awful lot on buying back their stock,
p166
aVwhich is quite problematic.
p167
aVIn fact, companies like Pfizer and Amgen recently
p168
aVhave spent more money in buying back their shares
p169
aVto boost their stock price than on R&D,
p170
aVbut that's a whole different TED Talk which one day
p171
aVI'd be fascinated to tell you about.
p172
aa(lp173
VNow, what's interesting in all of this
p174
aVis the state, in all these examples,
p175
aVwas doing so much more than just fixing market failures.
p176
aVIt was actually shaping and creating markets.
p177
aVIt was funding not only the basic research,
p178
aVwhich again is a typical public good,
p179
aVbut even the applied research.
p180
aVIt was even, God forbid, being a venture capitalist.
p181
aVSo these SBIR and SDTR programs,
p182
aVwhich give small companies early-stage finance
p183
aVhave not only been extremely important
p184
aVcompared to private venture capital,
p185
aVbut also have become increasingly important.
p186
aVWhy? Because, as many of us know,
p187
aVV.C. is actually quite short-term.
p188
aVThey want their returns in three to five years.
p189
aVInnovation takes a much longer time than that,
p190
aV15 to 20 years.
p191
aVAnd so this whole notion \u2014 I mean, this is the point, right?
p192
aVWho's actually funding the hard stuff?
p193
aVOf course, it's not just the state.
p194
aVThe private sector does a lot.
p195
aVBut the narrative that we've always been told
p196
aVis the state is important for the basics,
p197
aVbut not really providing that sort of high-risk,
p198
aVrevolutionary thinking out of the box.
p199
aVIn all these sectors, from funding the Internet
p200
aVto doing the spending, but also the envisioning,
p201
aVthe strategic vision, for these investments,
p202
aVit was actually coming within the state.
p203
aVThe nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating
p204
aVto study this, because the word itself, nanotechnology,
p205
aVcame from within government.
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd so there's huge implications of this.
p208
aVFirst of all, of course I'm not someone,
p209
aVthis old-fashioned person, market versus state.
p210
aVWhat we all know in dynamic capitalism
p211
aVis that what we actually need are public-private partnerships.
p212
aVBut the point is, by constantly depicting
p213
aVthe state part as necessary
p214
aVbut actually \u2014 pffff \u2014 a bit boring
p215
aVand often a bit dangerous kind of Leviathan,
p216
aVI think we've actually really stunted the possibility
p217
aVto build these public-private partnerships
p218
aVin a really dynamic way.
p219
aVEven the words that we often use to justify the "P" part,
p220
aVthe public part \u2014 well, they're both P's \u2014
p221
aVwith public-private partnerships
p222
aVis in terms of de-risking.
p223
aVWhat the public sector did in all these examples
p224
aVI just gave you, and there's many more,
p225
aVwhich myself and other colleagues have been looking at,
p226
aVis doing much more than de-risking.
p227
aVIt's kind of been taking on that risk. Bring it on.
p228
aVIt's actually been the one thinking out of the box.
p229
aVBut also, I'm sure you all have had experience
p230
aVwith local, regional, national governments,
p231
aVand you're kind of like, "You know what, that Kafka-ian bureaucrat, I've met him."
p232
aVThat whole juxtaposition thing, it's kind of there.
p233
aVWell, there's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
p234
aVBy talking about the state as kind of irrelevant,
p235
aVboring, it's sometimes
p236
aVthat we actually create those organizations in that way.
p237
aVSo what we have to actually do is build
p238
aVthese entrepreneurial state organizations.
p239
aVDARPA, that funded the Internet and Siri,
p240
aVactually thought really hard about this,
p241
aVhow to welcome failure, because you will fail.
p242
aVYou will fail when you innovative.
p243
aVOne out of 10 experiments has any success.
p244
aVAnd the V.C. guys know this,
p245
aVand they're able to actually fund the other losses
p246
aVfrom that one success.
p247
aa(lp248
VAnd this brings me, actually, probably,
p249
aVto the biggest implication,
p250
aVand this has huge implications beyond innovation.
p251
aVIf the state is more than just a market fixer,
p252
aVif it actually is a market shaper,
p253
aVand in doing that has had to take on this massive risk,
p254
aVwhat happened to the reward?
p255
aVWe all know, if you've ever taken a finance course,
p256
aVthe first thing you're taught is sort of the risk-reward relationship,
p257
aVand so some people are foolish enough
p258
aVor probably smart enough if they have time to wait,
p259
aVto actually invest in stocks, because they're higher risk
p260
aVwhich over time will make a greater reward than bonds,
p261
aVthat whole risk-reward thing.
p262
aVWell, where's the reward for the state
p263
aVof having taken on these massive risks
p264
aVand actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet?
p265
aVThe Internet was crazy.
p266
aVIt really was. I mean, the probability of failure was massive.
p267
aVYou had to be completely nuts to do it,
p268
aVand luckily, they were.
p269
aVNow, we don't even get to this question about rewards
p270
aVunless you actually depict the state as this risk-taker.
p271
aVAnd the problem is that economists often think,
p272
aVwell, there is a reward back to the state. It's tax.
p273
aVYou know, the companies will pay tax,
p274
aVthe jobs they create will create growth
p275
aVso people who get those jobs and their incomes rise
p276
aVwill come back to the state through the tax mechanism.
p277
aVWell, unfortunately, that's not true.
p278
aVOkay, it's not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad.
p279
aVGlobalization, and that's fine. We shouldn't be nationalistic.
p280
aVLet the jobs go where they have to go, perhaps.
p281
aVI mean, one can take a position on that.
p282
aVBut also these companies
p283
aVthat have actually had this massive benefit from the state \u2014
p284
aVApple's a great example.
p285
aVThey even got the first \u2014 well, not the first,
p286
aVbut 500,000 dollars actually went to Apple, the company,
p287
aVthrough this SBIC program,
p288
aVwhich predated the SBIR program,
p289
aVas well as, as I said before, all the technologies behind the iPhone.
p290
aVAnd yet we know they legally,
p291
aVas many other companies, pay very little tax back.
p292
aa(lp293
VSo what we really need to actually rethink
p294
aVis should there perhaps be a return-generating mechanism
p295
aVthat's much more direct than tax. Why not?
p296
aVIt could happen perhaps through equity.
p297
aVThis, by the way, in the countries
p298
aVthat are actually thinking about this strategically,
p299
aVcountries like Finland in Scandinavia,
p300
aVbut also in China and Brazil,
p301
aVthey're retaining equity in these investments.
p302
aVSitra funded Nokia, kept equity, made a lot of money,
p303
aVit's a public funding agency in Finland,
p304
aVwhich then funded the next round of Nokias.
p305
aVThe Brazilian Development Bank,
p306
aVwhich is providing huge amounts of funds today
p307
aVto clean technology, they just announced
p308
aVa $56 billion program for the future on this,
p309
aVis retaining equity in these investments.
p310
aVSo to put it provocatively,
p311
aVhad the U.S. government thought about this,
p312
aVand maybe just brought back
p313
aVjust something called an innovation fund,
p314
aVyou can bet that, you know, if even just .05 percent
p315
aVof the profits from what the Internet produced
p316
aVhad come back to that innovation fund,
p317
aVthere would be so much more money
p318
aVto spend today on green technology.
p319
aVInstead, many of the state budgets
p320
aVwhich in theory are trying to do that
p321
aVare being constrained.
p322
aVBut perhaps even more important,
p323
aVwe heard before about the one percent,
p324
aVthe 99 percent.
p325
aVIf the state is thought about in this more strategic way,
p326
aVas one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism,
p327
aVbecause that's what we're talking about, right?
p328
aVWho are the different players in creating value
p329
aVin the economy, and is the state's role,
p330
aVhas it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat player?
p331
aVIf we can actually have a broader theory
p332
aVof value creation and allow us to actually admit
p333
aVwhat the state has been doing and reap something back,
p334
aVit might just be that in the next round,
p335
aVand I hope that we all hope that the next big revolution
p336
aVwill in fact be green,
p337
aVthat that period of growth
p338
aVwill not only be smart, innovation-led,
p339
aVnot only green, but also more inclusive,
p340
aVso that the public schools in places like Silicon Valley
p341
aVcan actually also benefit from that growth,
p342
aVbecause they have not.
p343
aa(lp344
VThank you.

That argument is used in support of making states smaller and the private sector bigger. In her latest book, <em><a href=\\"http://www.anthempress.com/the-entrepreneurial-state\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The Entrepreneurial State: Debunking Private vs. Public Myths in Innovation</a> </em>and in her research, Mariana Mazzucato offers a bold contrarian view: States aren&#39;t only market regulators and fixers, but &quot;market makers&quot; -- actively creating a vision for innovation and investing in risky and uncertain areas where private capital may not see the ROI. Yes: Private venture capital is much less risk-taking than generally thought. As an example, the technology behind the iPhone and Google exists because the U.S. government has been very interventionist in funding innovation. Private investors jumped in only later. The same is true today of what promises to be the next big thing after the Internet: the green revolution.</p><p>Mazzucato, a professor of economics at the Science and Technology Policy Research Unit (SPRU, University of Sussex), argues that Europe needs today to rediscover that role -- that what the continent needs is not austerity but strategic investments (and new instruments such as public investments banks) towards an &quot;innovation Union.&quot;</p>", "slug": "mariana_mazzucato", "whotheyare": "Which actor in the economy is most responsible for making radical innovation happen?

In her latest book, <em><a href=\\"http://www.anthempress.com/the-entrepreneurial-state\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The Entrepreneurial State: Debunking Private vs. Public Myths in Innovation</a> </em>and in her research, Mariana Mazzucato offers a bold contrarian view: States aren&#39;t only market regulators and fixers, but &quot;market makers&quot; -- actively creating a vision for innovation and investing in risky and uncertain areas where private capital may not see the ROI. Yes: Private venture capital is much less risk-taking than generally thought. As an example, the technology behind the iPhone and Google exists because the U.S. government has been very interventionist in funding innovation. Private investors jumped in only later. The same is true today of what promises to be the next big thing after the Internet: the green revolution.</p><p>Mazzucato, a professor of economics at the Science and Technology Policy Research Unit (SPRU, University of Sussex), argues that Europe needs today to rediscover that role -- that what the continent needs is not austerity but strategic investments (and new instruments such as public investments banks) towards an &quot;innovation Union.&quot;</p>", "slug": "mariana_mazzucato", "whotheyare": "Which actor in the economy is most responsible for making radical innovation happen?

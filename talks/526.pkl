VThis machine, which we all have residing in our skulls,
p5
aVreminds me of an aphorism, of a
p6
aVcomment of Woody Allen
p7
aVto ask about what is the very best thing to have within your skull.
p8
aVAnd it's this machine.
p9
aVAnd it's constructed for change. It's all about change.
p10
aVIt confers on us the ability to do things tomorrow that we can't do today,
p11
aVthings today that we couldn't do yesterday.
p12
aVAnd of course it's born stupid.
p13
aa(lp14
VThe last time you were in the presence of a baby \u2014
p15
aVthis happens to be my granddaughter, Mitra.
p16
aVIsn't she fabulous?
p17
aV(Laughter)
p18
aVBut nonetheless when she popped out
p19
aVdespite the fact that her brain had actually been progressing
p20
aVin its development for several months before
p21
aVon the basis of her experiences in the womb \u2014
p22
aVnonetheless she had very limited abilities,
p23
aVas does every infant
p24
aVat the time of normal, natural full-term birth.
p25
aVIf we were to assay her perceptual abilities, they would be crude.
p26
aVThere is no real indication that there is any real thinking going on.
p27
aVIn fact there is little evidence that there is any
p28
aVcognitive ability in a very young infant.
p29
aVInfants don't respond to much.
p30
aVThere is not really much of an indication in fact that there is a person on board.
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aVAnd they can only in a very primitive way, and in a very limited way
p33
aVcontrol their movements.
p34
aa(lp35
VIt would be several months before this infant
p36
aVcould do something as simple as reach out and grasp
p37
aVunder voluntary control an object and retrieve it,
p38
aVusually to the mouth.
p39
aVAnd it will be some months beforeward,
p40
aVand we see a long steady progression
p41
aVof the evolution from the first wiggles,
p42
aVto rolling over, and sitting up, and crawling,
p43
aVstanding, walking,
p44
aVbefore we get to that magical point
p45
aVin which we can motate in the world.
p46
aVAnd yet, when we look forward in the brain
p47
aVwe see really remarkable advance.
p48
aVBy this age the brain can actually store.
p49
aVIt has stored, recorded,
p50
aVcan fastly retrieve
p51
aVthe meanings of thousands,
p52
aVtens of thousands of objects,
p53
aVactions, and their relationships in the world.
p54
aVAnd those relationships can in fact be constructed in hundreds of thousands,
p55
aVpotentially millions of ways.
p56
aVBy this age the brain controls very refined perceptual abilities.
p57
aVAnd it actually has a growing repertoire of cognitive skills.
p58
aVThis brain is very much a thinking machine.
p59
aVAnd by this age there is absolutely no question
p60
aVthat this brain, it has a person on board.
p61
aVAnd in fact at this age it is substantially controlling its own self-development.
p62
aVAnd by this age we see a remarkable evolution
p63
aVin its capacity to control movement.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow movement has advanced to the point
p66
aVwhere it can actually control movement simultaneously,
p67
aVin a complex sequence, in complex ways
p68
aVas would be required for example
p69
aVfor playing a complicated game,
p70
aVlike soccer.
p71
aVNow this boy can bounce a soccer ball on his head.
p72
aVAnd where this boy comes from, Sao Paulo, Brazil,
p73
aVabout 40 percent of boys of his age have this ability.
p74
aVYou could go out into the community in Monterey,
p75
aVand you'd have difficulty finding a boy that has this ability.
p76
aVAnd if you did he'd probably be from Sao Paulo.
p77
aV(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VThat's all another way of saying
p80
aVthat our individual skills and abilities
p81
aVare very much shaped by our environments.
p82
aVThat environment extends into our contemporary culture,
p83
aVthe thing our brain is challenged with.
p84
aVBecause what we've done in our personal evolutions
p85
aVis build up a large repertoire of specific skills and abilities
p86
aVthat are specific to our own individual histories.
p87
aVAnd in fact they result in a wonderful
p88
aVdifferentiation in humankind,
p89
aVin the way that, in fact, no two of us
p90
aVare quite alike.
p91
aVEvery one of us has a different set of acquired skills and abilities
p92
aVthat all derive out of the plasticity,
p93
aVthe adaptability of this really remarkable adaptive machine.
p94
aVIn an adult brain of course we've built up
p95
aVa large repertoire of mastered skills and abilities
p96
aVthat we can perform more or less automatically from memory,
p97
aVand that define us as acting, moving, thinking creatures.
p98
aa(lp99
VNow we study this,
p100
aVas the nerdy, laboratory, university-based scientists that we are,
p101
aVby engaging the brains
p102
aVof animals like rats, or monkeys,
p103
aVor of this particularly curious creature \u2014
p104
aVone of the more bizarre forms of life on earth \u2014
p105
aVto engage them in learning new skills and abilities.
p106
aVAnd we try to track the changes that occur
p107
aVas the new skill or ability is acquired.
p108
aVIn fact we do this in individuals
p109
aVof any age, in these different species \u2014
p110
aVthat is to say from infancies,
p111
aVinfancy up to adulthood and old age.
p112
aVSo we might engage a rat, for example,
p113
aVto acquire a new skill or ability
p114
aVthat might involve the rat using its paw
p115
aVto master particular manual grasp behaviors
p116
aVjust like we might examine a child
p117
aVand their ability to acquire the sub-skills,
p118
aVor the general overall skill of accomplishing something
p119
aVlike mastering the ability to read.
p120
aVOr you might look in an older individual
p121
aVwho has mastered a complex set of abilities
p122
aVthat might relate to reading musical notation
p123
aVor performing the mechanical acts of performance
p124
aVthat apply to musical performance.
p125
aa(lp126
VFrom these studies we defined two great epochs
p127
aVof the plastic history of the brain.
p128
aVThe first great epoch is commonly called the "Critical Period."
p129
aVAnd that is the period in which the brain is setting up
p130
aVin its initial form its basic processing machinery.
p131
aVThis is actually a period of dramatic change
p132
aVin which it doesn't take learning, per se, to drive
p133
aVthe initial differentiation of the machinery of the brain.
p134
aVAll it takes for example in the sound domain,
p135
aVis exposure to sound.
p136
aVAnd the brain actually is at the mercy
p137
aVof the sound environment in which it is reared.
p138
aVSo for example I can rear an animal
p139
aVin an environment in which there is meaningless dumb sound,
p140
aVa repertoire of sound that I make up,
p141
aVthat I make, just by exposure, artificially important
p142
aVto the animal and its young brain.
p143
aVAnd what I see is that the animal's brain sets up
p144
aVits initial processing of that sound
p145
aVin a form that's idealized, within the limits of its processing achievements
p146
aVto represent it in an organized and orderly way.
p147
aVThe sound doesn't have to be valuable to the animal:
p148
aVI could raise the animal in something that could be hypothetically valuable,
p149
aVlike the sounds that simulate
p150
aVthe sounds of a native language of a child.
p151
aVAnd I see the brain actually develop a processor that is specialized \u2014
p152
aVspecialized for that complex array, a repertoire of sounds.
p153
aVIt actually exaggerates their separateness of representation,
p154
aVin multi-dimensional neuronal representational terms.
p155
aa(lp156
VOr I can expose the animal to a completely meaningless and destructive sound.
p157
aVI can raise an animal under conditions
p158
aVthat would be equivalent to raising a baby
p159
aVunder a moderately loud ceiling fan,
p160
aVin the presence of continuous noise.
p161
aVAnd when I do that I actually specialize the brain
p162
aVto be a master processor for that meaningless sound.
p163
aVAnd I frustrate its ability
p164
aVto represent any meaningful sound as a consequence.
p165
aVSuch things in the early history of babies
p166
aVoccur in real babies.
p167
aVAnd they account for, for example
p168
aVthe beautiful evolution of a language-specific processor
p169
aVin every normally developing baby.
p170
aVAnd so they also account for
p171
aVdevelopment of defective processing
p172
aVin a substantial population of children
p173
aVwho are more limited, as a consequence,
p174
aVin their language abilities at an older age.
p175
aa(lp176
VNow in this early period of plasticity
p177
aVthe brain actually changes outside of a learning context.
p178
aVI don't have to be paying attention to what I hear.
p179
aVThe input doesn't really have to be meaningful.
p180
aVI don't have to be in a behavioral context.
p181
aVThis is required so the brain sets up it's processing
p182
aVso that it can act differentially,
p183
aVso that it can act selectively,
p184
aVso that the creature that wears it, that carries it,
p185
aVcan begin to operate on it in a selective way.
p186
aVIn the next great epoch of life, which applies for most of life,
p187
aVthe brain is actually refining its machinery
p188
aVas it masters a wide repertoire of skills and abilities.
p189
aVAnd in this epoch,
p190
aVwhich extends from late in the first year of life to death;
p191
aVit's actually doing this under behavioral control.
p192
aVAnd that's another way of saying
p193
aVthe brain has strategies that define
p194
aVthe significance of the input to the brain.
p195
aVAnd it's focusing on skill after skill,
p196
aVor ability after ability,
p197
aVunder specific attentional control.
p198
aVIt's a function of whether a goal in a behavior is achieved
p199
aVor whether the individual is rewarded in the behavior.
p200
aVThis is actually very powerful.
p201
aVThis lifelong capacity for plasticity, for brain change,
p202
aVis powerfully expressed.
p203
aVIt is the basis of our real differentiation,
p204
aVone individual from another.
p205
aVYou can look down in the brain of an animal
p206
aVthat's engaged in a specific skill,
p207
aVand you can witness or document this change on a variety of levels.
p208
aa(lp209
VSo here is a very simple experiment.
p210
aVIt was actually conducted about five years ago
p211
aVin collaboration with scientists from the University of Provence
p212
aVin Marseilles.
p213
aVIt's a very simple experiment where a monkey has been trained
p214
aVin a task that involves it manipulating a tool
p215
aVthat's equivalent in its difficulty
p216
aVto a child learning to manipulate or handle a spoon.
p217
aVThe monkey actually mastered the task
p218
aVin about 700 practice tries.
p219
aVSo in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all.
p220
aVIt had a success rate of about one in eight tries.
p221
aVThose tries were elaborate.
p222
aVEach attempt was substantially different from the other.
p223
aVBut the monkey gradually developed a strategy.
p224
aVAnd 700 or so tries later
p225
aVthe monkey is performing it flawlessly \u2014 never fails.
p226
aVHe's successful in his retrieval of food with this tool every time.
p227
aVAt this point the task is being performed
p228
aVin a beautifully stereotyped way:
p229
aVvery beautifully regulated and highly repeated, trial to trial.
p230
aa(lp231
VWe can look down in the brain of the monkey.
p232
aVAnd we see that it's distorted.
p233
aVWe can track these changes, and have tracked these changes
p234
aVin many such behaviors across time.
p235
aVAnd here we see the distortion
p236
aVreflected in the map of the skin surfaces of the hand of the monkey.
p237
aVNow this is a map, down in the surface of the brain,
p238
aVin which, in a very elaborate experiment we've reconstructed the responses,
p239
aVlocation by location,
p240
aVin a highly detailed response mapping of the responses of its neurons.
p241
aVWe see here a reconstruction of how
p242
aVthe hand is represented in the brain.
p243
aVWe've actually distorted the map by the exercise.
p244
aVAnd that is indicated in the pink. We have a couple fingertip surfaces that are larger.
p245
aVThese are the surfaces the monkey is using to manipulate the tool.
p246
aVIf we look at the selectivity of responses
p247
aVin the cortex of the monkey,
p248
aVwe see that the monkey has actually changed the filter characteristics
p249
aVwhich represents input from the skin
p250
aVof the fingertips that are engaged.
p251
aVIn other words there is still a single, simple representation of the fingertips
p252
aVin this most organized of cortical areas
p253
aVof the surface of the skin of the body.
p254
aVMonkey has like you have.
p255
aVAnd yet now it's represented in substantially finer grain.
p256
aVThe monkey is getting more detailed information from these surfaces.
p257
aVAnd that is an unknown \u2014 unsuspected, maybe, by you \u2014
p258
aVpart of acquiring the skill or ability.
p259
aa(lp260
VNow actually we've looked in several different cortical areas
p261
aVin the monkey learning this task.
p262
aVAnd each one of them changes in ways that are specific
p263
aVto the skill or ability.
p264
aVSo for example we can look to the cortical area
p265
aVthat represents input that's controlling the posture of the monkey.
p266
aVWe look in cortical areas that control specific movements,
p267
aVand the sequences of movements
p268
aVthat are required in the behavior, and so forth.
p269
aVThey are all remodeled. They all become specialized for the task at hand.
p270
aVThere are 15 or 20 cortical areas that are changed specifically
p271
aVwhen you learn a simple skill like this.
p272
aVAnd that represents in your brain, really massive change.
p273
aVIt represents the change in a reliable way
p274
aVof the responses of tens of millions,
p275
aVpossibly hundreds of millions of neurons in your brain.
p276
aVIt represents changes
p277
aVof hundreds of millions, possibly billions
p278
aVof synaptic connections in your brain.
p279
aVThis is constructed by physical change.
p280
aVAnd the level of construction that occurs is massive.
p281
aVThink about the changes that occur in the brain of a child
p282
aVthrough the course of acquiring their movement behavior abilities in general.
p283
aVOr acquiring their native language abilities.
p284
aVThe changes are massive.
p285
aa(lp286
VWhat it's all about is the selective representations
p287
aVof things that are important to the brain.
p288
aVBecause in most of the life of the brain
p289
aVthis is under control of behavioral context.
p290
aVIt's what you pay attention to.
p291
aVIt's what's rewarding to you.
p292
aVIt's what the brain regards, itself,
p293
aVas positive and important to you.
p294
aVIt's all about cortical processing
p295
aVand forebrain specialization.
p296
aVAnd that underlies your specialization.
p297
aVThat is why you, in your many skills and abilities,
p298
aVare a unique specialist:
p299
aVa specialist that's vastly different
p300
aVin your physical brain in detail
p301
aVthan the brain of an individual 100 years ago;
p302
aVenormously different in the details
p303
aVfrom the brain of the average individual 1,000 years ago.
p304
aVNow, one of the characteristics of this change process
p305
aVis that information is always related
p306
aVto other inputs or information that is occurring
p307
aVin immediate time, in context.
p308
aVAnd that's because the brain is constructing representations of things
p309
aVthat are correlated in little moments of time
p310
aVand that relate to one another in little moments of successive time.
p311
aVThe brain is recording all information
p312
aVand driving all change
p313
aVin temporal context.
p314
aVNow overwhelmingly the most powerful context
p315
aVthat's occurred in your brain is you.
p316
aVBillions of events have occurred in your history
p317
aVthat are related in time to yourself
p318
aVas the receiver,
p319
aVor yourself as the actor, yourself as the thinker,
p320
aVyourself as the mover.
p321
aVBillions of times little pieces of sensation have come in
p322
aVfrom the surface of your body
p323
aVthat are always associated with you as the receiver,
p324
aVand that result in
p325
aVthe embodiment of you.
p326
aVYou are constructed, your self is constructed
p327
aVfrom these billions of events.
p328
aVIt's constructed. It's created in your brain.
p329
aVAnd it's created in the brain via physical change.
p330
aVThis is a marvelously constructed thing
p331
aVthat results in individual form
p332
aVbecause each one of us has vastly different histories,
p333
aVand vastly different experiences,
p334
aVthat drive in to us this marvelous differentiation of self,
p335
aVof personhood.
p336
aa(lp337
VNow we've used this research
p338
aVto try to understand not just how a normal person develops,
p339
aVand elaborates their skills and abilities,
p340
aVbut also try to understand
p341
aVthe origins of impairment,
p342
aVand the origins of differences or variations
p343
aVthat might limit the capacities of a child, or an adult.
p344
aVI'm going to talk about using these strategies
p345
aVto actually design brain plasticity-based
p346
aVapproach to drive corrections in the machinery of a child
p347
aVthat increases the competence of the child
p348
aVas a language receiver and user
p349
aVand, thereafter, as a reader.
p350
aVAnd I'm going to talk about experiments that involve
p351
aVactually using this brain science,
p352
aVfirst of all to understand how it contributes to the loss of function as we age.
p353
aVAnd then, by using it in a targeted approach
p354
aVwe're going to try to differentiate
p355
aVthe machinery to recover function in old age.
p356
aa(lp357
VSo the first example I'm going to talk about
p358
aVrelates to children with learning impairments.
p359
aVWe now have a large body of literature
p360
aVthat demonstrates that the fundamental
p361
aVproblem that occurs in the majority of children
p362
aVthat have early language impairments,
p363
aVand that are going to struggle to learn to read,
p364
aVis that their language processor
p365
aVis created in a defective form.
p366
aVAnd the reason that it rises in a defective form
p367
aVis because early in the baby's brain's life
p368
aVthe machine process is noisy.
p369
aVIt's that simple.
p370
aVIt's a signal-to-noise problem. Okay?
p371
aVAnd there are a lot of things that contribute to that.
p372
aVThere are numerous inherited faults
p373
aVthat could make the machine process noisier.
p374
aVNow I might say the noise problem could also occur
p375
aVon the basis of information provided
p376
aVin the world from the ears.
p377
aa(lp378
VIf any \u2014 those of you who are older in the audience know
p379
aVthat when I was a child we understood that a child born with a cleft palate
p380
aVwas born with what we called mental retardation.
p381
aVWe knew that they were going to be slow cognitively;
p382
aVwe knew they were going to struggle to learn to develop normal language abilities;
p383
aVand we knew that they were going to struggle to learn to read.
p384
aVMost of them would be intellectual and academic failures.
p385
aVThat's disappeared. That no longer applies.
p386
aVThat inherited weakness, that inherited condition
p387
aVhas evaporated.
p388
aVWe don't hear about that anymore. Where did it go?
p389
aVWell, it was understood by a Dutch surgeon,
p390
aVabout 35 years ago,
p391
aVthat if you simply fix the problem early enough,
p392
aVwhen the brain is still in this initial plastic period
p393
aVso it can set up this machinery adequately,
p394
aVin this initial set up time in the critical period,
p395
aVnone of that happens.
p396
aVWhat are you doing by operating on the cleft palate to correct it?
p397
aVYou're basically opening up
p398
aVthe tubes that drain fluid from the middle ears,
p399
aVwhich have had them reliably full.
p400
aVEvery sound the child hears uncorrected is muffled.
p401
aVIt's degraded.
p402
aVThe child's native language is such a case is not English.
p403
aVIt's not Japanese.
p404
aVIt's muffled English. It's degraded Japanese.
p405
aVIt's crap.
p406
aVAnd the brain specializes for it.
p407
aVIt creates a representation of language crap.
p408
aVAnd then the child is stuck with it.
p409
aa(lp410
VNow the crap doesn't just happen in the ear.
p411
aVIt can also happen in the brain.
p412
aVThe brain itself can be noisy. It's commonly noisy.
p413
aVThere are many inherited faults that can make it noisier.
p414
aVAnd the native language for a child with such a brain
p415
aVis degraded.
p416
aVIt's not English. It's noisy English.
p417
aVAnd that results in defective representations of sounds of words \u2014
p418
aVnot normal \u2014 a different strategy,
p419
aVby a machine that has different time constants and different space constants.
p420
aVAnd you can look in the brain of such a child and record those time constants.
p421
aVThey are about an order of magnitude longer,
p422
aVabout 11 times longer in duration on average,
p423
aVthan in a normal child.
p424
aVSpace constants are about three times greater.
p425
aVSuch a child will have memory and cognitive deficits
p426
aVin this domain.
p427
aVOf course they will. Because as a receiver of language,
p428
aVthey are receiving it and representing it,
p429
aVand in information it's representing crap.
p430
aVAnd they are going to have poor reading skills.
p431
aVBecause reading is dependent upon the translation of word sounds
p432
aVinto this orthographic or visual
p433
aVrepresentational form.
p434
aVIf you don't have a brain representation of word sounds
p435
aVthat translation makes no sense.
p436
aVAnd you are going to have corresponding abnormal neurology.
p437
aa(lp438
VThen these children increasingly
p439
aVin evaluation after evaluation,
p440
aVin their operations in language, and their operations in reading \u2014
p441
aVwe document that abnormal neurology.
p442
aVThe point is is that you can train the brain out of this.
p443
aVA way to think about this is you can actually re-refine
p444
aVthe processing capacity of the machinery
p445
aVby changing it.
p446
aVChanging it in detail. It takes about 30 hours on the average.
p447
aVAnd we've accomplished that in about 430,000 kids today.
p448
aVActually, probably about 15,000 children are being trained as we speak.
p449
aVAnd actually when you look at the impacts, the impacts are substantial.
p450
aa(lp451
VSo here we're looking at the normal distribution.
p452
aVWhat we're most interested in is these kids on the left side of the distribution.
p453
aVThis is from about 3,000 children.
p454
aVYou can see that most of the children on the left side of the distribution
p455
aVare moving into the middle or the right.
p456
aVThis is in a broad assessment of their language abilities.
p457
aVThis is like an IQ test for language.
p458
aVThe impact in the distribution, if you trained every child
p459
aVin the United States, would be to shift the whole distribution to the right
p460
aVand narrow the distribution.
p461
aVThis is a substantially large impact.
p462
aa(lp463
VThink of a classroom of children in the language arts.
p464
aVThink of the children on the slow side of the class.
p465
aVWe have the potential to move most of those children
p466
aVto the middle or to the right side.
p467
aVIn addition to accurate language training
p468
aVit also fixes memory and cognition
p469
aVspeech fluency and speech production.
p470
aVAnd an important language dependent skill is enabled by this training \u2014
p471
aVthat is to say reading.
p472
aVAnd to a large extent it fixes the brain.
p473
aVYou can look down in the brain of a child
p474
aVin a variety of tasks that scientists have at Stanford,
p475
aVand MIT, and UCSF, and UCLA, and a number of other institutions.
p476
aVAnd children operating in various language behaviors,
p477
aVor in various reading behaviors,
p478
aVyou see for the most extent,
p479
aVfor most children, their neuronal responses,
p480
aVcomplexly abnormal before you start,
p481
aVare normalized by the training.
p482
aa(lp483
VNow you can also take the same approach
p484
aVto address problems in aging.
p485
aVWhere again the machinery is deteriorating now
p486
aVfrom competent machinery, it's going south.
p487
aVNoise is increasing in the brain.
p488
aVAnd learning modulation and control is deteriorating.
p489
aVAnd you can actually look down on the brain of such an individual
p490
aVand witness a change in the time constants and space constants
p491
aVwith which, for example, the brain is representing language again.
p492
aVJust as the brain came out of chaos at the beginning,
p493
aVit's going back into chaos in the end.
p494
aVThis results in declines in memory
p495
aVin cognition, and in postural ability and agility.
p496
aVIt turns out you can train the brain of such an individual \u2014
p497
aVthis is a small population of such individuals \u2014
p498
aVtrain equally intensively for about 30 hours.
p499
aVThese are 80- to 90-year-olds.
p500
aa(lp501
VAnd what you see are substantial improvements of their immediate memory,
p502
aVof their ability to remember things after a delay,
p503
aVof their ability to control their attention,
p504
aVtheir language abilities and visual-spatial abilities.
p505
aVThe overall neuropsychological index
p506
aVof these trained individuals in this population
p507
aVis about two standard deviations.
p508
aVThat means that if you sit at the left side of the distribution,
p509
aVand I'm looking at your neuropyschological abilities,
p510
aVthe average person has moved to the middle
p511
aVor the right side of the distribution.
p512
aVIt means that most people who are at risk for senility,
p513
aVmore or less immediately,
p514
aVare now in a protected position.
p515
aa(lp516
VMy issues are to try to get to rescuing
p517
aVolder citizens more completely and in larger numbers,
p518
aVbecause I think this can be done in this arena on a vast scale \u2014
p519
aVand the same for kids.
p520
aVMy main interest is how to elaborate this science to address other maladies.
p521
aVI'm specifically interested in things like autism,
p522
aVand cerebral palsy, these great childhood catastrophes.
p523
aVAnd in older age conditions like Parkinsonism,
p524
aVand in other acquired impairments like schizophrenia.
p525
aa(lp526
VYour issues as it relates to this science,
p527
aVis how to maintain your own high-functioning learning machine.
p528
aVAnd of course, a well-ordered life
p529
aVin which learning is a continuous part of it, is key.
p530
aVBut also in your future is brain aerobics.
p531
aVGet ready for it. It's going to be a part of every life
p532
aVnot too far in the future,
p533
aVjust like physical exercise
p534
aVis a part of every well organized life in the contemporary period.
p535
aVThe other way that we will ultimately come to consider this
p536
aVliterature and the science that is important to you
p537
aVis in a consideration of how to nurture yourself.
p538
aVNow that you know, now that science is telling us
p539
aVthat you are in charge,
p540
aVthat it's under your control,
p541
aVthat your happiness, your well-being,
p542
aVyour abilities, your capacities,
p543
aVare capable of continuous modification,
p544
aVcontinuous improvement,
p545
aVand you're the responsible agent and party.
p546
aVOf course a lot of people will ignore this advice.
p547
aVIt will be a long time before they really understand it.
p548
aV(Laughter)
p549
aVNow that's another issue and not my fault.
p550
aVOkay. Thank you.

VWe grew up
p5
aVinteracting with the physical objects around us.
p6
aVThere are an enormous number of them that we use every day.
p7
aVUnlike most of our computing devices,
p8
aVthese objects are much more fun to use.
p9
aVWhen you talk about objects,
p10
aVone other thing automatically comes attached to that thing,
p11
aVand that is gestures:
p12
aVhow we manipulate these objects,
p13
aVhow we use these objects in everyday life.
p14
aVWe use gestures not only to interact with these objects,
p15
aVbut we also use them to interact with each other.
p16
aVA gesture of "Namaste!", maybe, to respect someone, or maybe,
p17
aVin India I don't need to teach a kid that this means
p18
aV"four runs" in cricket.
p19
aVIt comes as a part of our everyday learning.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo, I am very interested, from the beginning,
p22
aVhow our knowledge about everyday objects and gestures,
p23
aVand how we use these objects,
p24
aVcan be leveraged to our interactions with the digital world.
p25
aVRather than using a keyboard and mouse,
p26
aVwhy can I not use my computer
p27
aVin the same way that I interact in the physical world?
p28
aa(lp29
VSo, I started this exploration around eight years back,
p30
aVand it literally started with a mouse on my desk.
p31
aVRather than using it for my computer, I actually opened it.
p32
aVMost of you might be aware that, in those days,
p33
aVthe mouse used to come with a ball inside,
p34
aVand there were two rollers
p35
aVthat actually guide the computer where the ball is moving,
p36
aVand, accordingly, where the mouse is moving.
p37
aVSo, I was interested in these two rollers,
p38
aVand I actually wanted more, so I borrowed another mouse from a friend \u2014
p39
aVnever returned to him \u2014
p40
aVand I now had four rollers.
p41
aVInterestingly, what I did with these rollers is,
p42
aVbasically, I took them off of these mouses and then put them in one line.
p43
aVIt had some strings and pulleys and some springs.
p44
aVWhat I got is basically a gesture-interface device
p45
aVthat actually acts as a motion-sensing device
p46
aVmade for two dollars.
p47
aVSo, here, whatever movement I do in my physical world
p48
aVis actually replicated inside the digital world
p49
aVjust using this small device that I made, around eight years back,
p50
aVin 2000.
p51
aa(lp52
VBecause I was interested in integrating these two worlds,
p53
aVI thought of sticky notes.
p54
aVI thought, "Why can I not connect
p55
aVthe normal interface of a physical sticky note
p56
aVto the digital world?"
p57
aVA message written on a sticky note to my mom,
p58
aVon paper,
p59
aVcan come to an SMS,
p60
aVor maybe a meeting reminder
p61
aVautomatically syncs with my digital calendar \u2014
p62
aVa to-do list that automatically syncs with you.
p63
aVBut you can also search in the digital world,
p64
aVor maybe you can write a query, saying,
p65
aV"What is Dr. Smith's address?"
p66
aVand this small system actually prints it out \u2014
p67
aVso it actually acts like a paper input-output system,
p68
aVjust made out of paper.
p69
aa(lp70
VIn another exploration,
p71
aVI thought of making a pen that can draw in three dimensions.
p72
aVSo, I implemented this pen that can help designers and architects
p73
aVnot only think in three dimensions,
p74
aVbut they can actually draw,
p75
aVso that it's more intuitive to use that way.
p76
aa(lp77
VThen I thought, "Why not make a Google Map,
p78
aVbut in the physical world?"
p79
aVRather than typing a keyword to find something,
p80
aVI put my objects on top of it.
p81
aVIf I put a boarding pass, it will show me where the flight gate is.
p82
aVA coffee cup will show where you can find more coffee,
p83
aVor where you can trash the cup.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo, these were some of the earlier explorations I did
p86
aVbecause the goal was to connect these two worlds seamlessly.
p87
aVAmong all these experiments,
p88
aVthere was one thing in common:
p89
aVI was trying to bring a part of the physical world
p90
aVto the digital world.
p91
aVI was taking some part of the objects,
p92
aVor any of the intuitiveness of real life,
p93
aVand bringing them to the digital world,
p94
aVbecause the goal was to make our computing interfaces more intuitive.
p95
aa(lp96
VBut then I realized that we humans are not actually interested in computing.
p97
aVWhat we are interested in is information.
p98
aVWe want to know about things.
p99
aVWe want to know about dynamic things going around.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo I thought, around last year \u2014 in the beginning of the last year \u2014
p102
aVI started thinking, "Why can I not take this approach in the reverse way?"
p103
aVMaybe, "How about I take my digital world
p104
aVand paint the physical world with that digital information?"
p105
aVBecause pixels are actually, right now, confined in these rectangular devices
p106
aVthat fit in our pockets.
p107
aVWhy can I not remove this confine
p108
aVand take that to my everyday objects, everyday life
p109
aVso that I don't need to learn the new language
p110
aVfor interacting with those pixels?
p111
aa(lp112
VSo, in order to realize this dream,
p113
aVI actually thought of putting a big-size projector on my head.
p114
aVI think that's why this is called a head-mounted projector, isn't it?
p115
aVI took it very literally,
p116
aVand took my bike helmet,
p117
aVput a little cut over there so that the projector actually fits nicely.
p118
aVSo now, what I can do \u2014
p119
aVI can augment the world around me with this digital information.
p120
aa(lp121
VBut later,
p122
aVI realized that I actually wanted to interact
p123
aVwith those digital pixels, also.
p124
aVSo I put a small camera over there that acts as a digital eye.
p125
aVLater, we moved to a much better,
p126
aVconsumer-oriented pendant version of that,
p127
aVthat many of you now know as the SixthSense device.
p128
aa(lp129
VBut the most interesting thing about this particular technology
p130
aVis that you can carry your digital world with you
p131
aVwherever you go.
p132
aVYou can start using any surface, any wall around you,
p133
aVas an interface.
p134
aVThe camera is actually tracking all your gestures.
p135
aVWhatever you're doing with your hands,
p136
aVit's understanding that gesture.
p137
aVAnd, actually, if you see, there are some color markers
p138
aVthat in the beginning version we are using with it.
p139
aVYou can start painting on any wall.
p140
aVYou stop by a wall, and start painting on that wall.
p141
aVBut we are not only tracking one finger, here.
p142
aVWe are giving you the freedom of using all of both of your hands,
p143
aVso you can actually use both of your hands to zoom into or zoom out
p144
aVof a map just by pinching all present.
p145
aVThe camera is actually doing \u2014 just, getting all the images \u2014
p146
aVis doing the edge recognition and also the color recognition
p147
aVand so many other small algorithms are going on inside.
p148
aVSo, technically, it's a little bit complex,
p149
aVbut it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use, in some sense.
p150
aa(lp151
VBut I'm more excited that you can actually take it outside.
p152
aVRather than getting your camera out of your pocket,
p153
aVyou can just do the gesture of taking a photo,
p154
aVand it takes a photo for you.
p155
aa(lp156
V(Applause)
p157
aa(lp158
VThank you.
p159
aVAnd later I can find a wall, anywhere,
p160
aVand start browsing those photos
p161
aVor maybe, "OK, I want to modify this photo a little bit
p162
aVand send it as an email to a friend."
p163
aVSo, we are looking for an era
p164
aVwhere computing will actually merge with the physical world.
p165
aVAnd, of course, if you don't have any surface,
p166
aVyou can start using your palm for simple operations.
p167
aVHere, I'm dialing a phone number just using my hand.
p168
aVThe camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements,
p169
aVbut, interestingly,
p170
aVis also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand.
p171
aa(lp172
VFor example, in this case,
p173
aVthe book cover is matched
p174
aVwith so many thousands, or maybe millions of books online,
p175
aVand checking out which book it is.
p176
aVOnce it has that information,
p177
aVit finds out more reviews about that,
p178
aVor maybe New York Times has a sound overview on that,
p179
aVso you can actually hear, on a physical book,
p180
aVa review as sound.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Video) Famous talk at Harvard University \u2014
p183
aa(lp184
VThis was Obama's visit last week to MIT.
p185
aa(lp186
V(Video) And particularly I want to thank two outstanding MIT \u2014
p187
aa(lp188
VPranav Mistry: So, I was seeing the live [video] of his talk,
p189
aVoutside, on just a newspaper.
p190
aVYour newspaper will show you live weather information
p191
aVrather than having it updated.
p192
aVYou have to check your computer in order to do that, right?
p193
aa(lp194
V(Applause)
p195
aa(lp196
VWhen I'm going back, I can just use my boarding pass
p197
aVto check how much my flight has been delayed,
p198
aVbecause at that particular time,
p199
aVI'm not feeling like opening my iPhone,
p200
aVand checking out a particular icon.
p201
aVAnd I think this technology will not only change the way \u2014
p202
aa(lp203
V(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
VYes.
p206
aVIt will change the way we interact with people, also,
p207
aVnot only the physical world.
p208
aVThe fun part is, I'm going to the Boston metro,
p209
aVand playing a pong game inside the train on the ground, right?
p210
aa(lp211
V(Laughter)
p212
aa(lp213
VAnd I think the imagination is the only limit
p214
aVof what you can think of
p215
aVwhen this kind of technology merges with real life.
p216
aa(lp217
VBut many of you argue, actually,
p218
aVthat all of our work is not only about physical objects.
p219
aVWe actually do lots of accounting and paper editing
p220
aVand all those kinds of things; what about that?
p221
aVAnd many of you are excited about the next-generation tablet computers
p222
aVto come out in the market.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo, rather than waiting for that,
p225
aVI actually made my own, just using a piece of paper.
p226
aVSo, what I did here is remove the camera \u2014
p227
aVAll the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera.
p228
aVI removed the microphone from that,
p229
aVand then just pinched that \u2014
p230
aVlike I just made a clip out of the microphone \u2014
p231
aVand clipped that to a piece of paper, any paper that you found around.
p232
aVSo now the sound of the touch
p233
aVis getting me when exactly I'm touching the paper.
p234
aVBut the camera is actually tracking where my fingers are moving.
p235
aa(lp236
VYou can of course watch movies.
p237
aa(lp238
V(Video) Good afternoon. My name is Russell,
p239
aVand I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54."
p240
aa(lp241
VPM: And you can of course play games.
p242
aa(lp243
V(Car engine)
p244
aa(lp245
VHere, the camera is actually understanding how you're holding the paper
p246
aVand playing a car-racing game.
p247
aa(lp248
V(Applause)
p249
aa(lp250
VMany of you already must have thought, OK, you can browse.
p251
aVYeah. Of course you can browse to any websites
p252
aVor you can do all sorts of computing on a piece of paper
p253
aVwherever you need it.
p254
aVSo, more interestingly,
p255
aVI'm interested in how we can take that in a more dynamic way.
p256
aVWhen I come back to my desk, I can just pinch that information
p257
aVback to my desktop
p258
aVso I can use my full-size computer.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Applause)
p261
aa(lp262
VAnd why only computers? We can just play with papers.
p263
aVPaper world is interesting to play with.
p264
aVHere, I'm taking a part of a document,
p265
aVand putting over here a second part from a second place,
p266
aVand I'm actually modifying the information that I have over there.
p267
aVYeah. And I say, "OK, this looks nice, let me print it out, that thing."
p268
aVSo I now have a print-out of that thing.
p269
aVSo the workflow is more intuitive,
p270
aVthe way we used to do it maybe 20 years back,
p271
aVrather than now switching between these two worlds.
p272
aa(lp273
VSo, as a last thought,
p274
aVI think that integrating information to everyday objects
p275
aVwill not only help us to get rid of the digital divide,
p276
aVthe gap between these two worlds,
p277
aVbut will also help us, in some way,
p278
aVto stay human,
p279
aVto be more connected to our physical world.
p280
aVAnd it will actually help us not end up being machines
p281
aVsitting in front of other machines.
p282
aa(lp283
VThat's all. Thank you.
p284
aa(lp285
V(Applause)
p286
aa(lp287
VThank you.
p288
aa(lp289
V(Applause)
p290
aa(lp291
VChris Anderson: So, Pranav, first of all, you're a genius.
p292
aVThis is incredible, really.
p293
aVWhat are you doing with this? Is there a company being planned?
p294
aVOr is this research forever, or what?
p295
aa(lp296
VPranav Mistry: So, there are lots of companies,
p297
aVsponsor companies of Media Lab interested in taking this ahead
p298
aVin one or another way.
p299
aVCompanies like mobile-phone operators
p300
aVwant to take this in a different way than the NGOs in India,
p301
aVthinking, "Why can we only have 'Sixth Sense'?
p302
aVWe should have a 'Fifth Sense' for missing-sense people who cannot speak.
p303
aVThis technology can be used for them to speak out in a different way
p304
aVmaybe a speaker system."
p305
aa(lp306
VCA: What are your own plans? Are you staying at MIT,
p307
aVor are you going to do something with this?
p308
aa(lp309
VPM: I'm trying to make this more available to people
p310
aVso that anyone can develop their own SixthSense device,
p311
aVbecause the hardware is actually not that hard to manufacture
p312
aVor hard to make your own.
p313
aVWe will provide all the open source software for them,
p314
aVmaybe starting next month.
p315
aa(lp316
VCA: Open source? Wow.
p317
aa(lp318
V(Applause)
p319
aa(lp320
VCA: Are you going to come back to India with some of this, at some point?
p321
aa(lp322
VPM: Yeah. Yes, yes, of course.
p323
aa(lp324
VCA: What are your plans? MIT? India?
p325
aVHow are you going to split your time going forward?
p326
aa(lp327
VPM: There is a lot of energy here. Lots of learning.
p328
aVAll of this work that you have seen is all about my learning in India.
p329
aVAnd now, if you see, it's more about the cost-effectiveness:
p330
aVthis system costs you $300
p331
aVcompared to the $20,000 surface tables, or anything like that.
p332
aVOr maybe even the $2 mouse gesture system at that time was costing around $5,000?
p333
aVI showed that, at a conference, to President Abdul Kalam, at that time,
p334
aVand then he said, "OK, we should use this in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre
p335
aVfor some use of that."
p336
aVSo I'm excited about how I can bring the technology to the masses
p337
aVrather than just keeping that technology in the lab environment.
p338
aa(lp339
V(Applause)
p340
aa(lp341
VCA: Based on the people we've seen at TED,
p342
aVI would say you're truly one of the two or three
p343
aVbest inventors in the world right now.
p344
aVIt's an honor to have you at TED.
p345
aVThank you so much.
p346
aVThat's fantastic.

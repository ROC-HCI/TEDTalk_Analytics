VA few years ago, I broke into my own house.
p5
aVI had just driven home,
p6
aVit was around midnight in the dead of Montreal winter,
p7
aVI had been visiting my friend, Jeff, across town,
p8
aVand the thermometer on the front porch read minus 40 degrees \u2014
p9
aVand don't bother asking if that's Celsius or Fahrenheit,
p10
aVminus 40 is where the two scales meet \u2014
p11
aVit was very cold.
p12
aVAnd as I stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets,
p13
aVI found I didn't have my keys.
p14
aVIn fact, I could see them through the window,
p15
aVlying on the dining room table where I had left them.
p16
aVSo I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows,
p17
aVand they were locked tight.
p18
aVI thought about calling a locksmith \u2014 at least I had my cellphone,
p19
aVbut at midnight, it could take a while for a locksmith to show up,
p20
aVand it was cold.
p21
aVI couldn't go back to my friend Jeff's house for the night
p22
aVbecause I had an early flight to Europe the next morning,
p23
aVand I needed to get my passport and my suitcase.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo, desperate and freezing cold,
p26
aVI found a large rock and I broke through the basement window,
p27
aVcleared out the shards of glass,
p28
aVI crawled through,
p29
aVI found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the opening,
p30
aVfiguring that in the morning, on the way to the airport,
p31
aVI could call my contractor and ask him to fix it.
p32
aVThis was going to be expensive,
p33
aVbut probably no more expensive than a middle-of-the-night locksmith,
p34
aVso I figured, under the circumstances, I was coming out even.
p35
aa(lp36
VNow, I'm a neuroscientist by training
p37
aVand I know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress.
p38
aVIt releases cortisol that raises your heart rate,
p39
aVit modulates adrenaline levels
p40
aVand it clouds your thinking.
p41
aVSo the next morning,
p42
aVwhen I woke up on too little sleep,
p43
aVworrying about the hole in the window,
p44
aVand a mental note that I had to call my contractor,
p45
aVand the freezing temperatures,
p46
aVand the meetings I had upcoming in Europe,
p47
aVand, you know, with all the cortisol in my brain,
p48
aVmy thinking was cloudy,
p49
aVbut I didn't know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd it wasn't until I got to the airport check-in counter,
p54
aVthat I realized I didn't have my passport.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VSo I raced home in the snow and ice, 40 minutes,
p59
aVgot my passport, raced back to the airport,
p60
aVI made it just in time,
p61
aVbut they had given away my seat to someone else,
p62
aVso I got stuck in the back of the plane, next to the bathrooms,
p63
aVin a seat that wouldn't recline, on an eight-hour flight.
p64
aVWell, I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd I started wondering, are there things that I can do,
p69
aVsystems that I can put into place,
p70
aVthat will prevent bad things from happening?
p71
aVOr at least if bad things happen,
p72
aVwill minimize the likelihood of it being a total catastrophe.
p73
aVSo I started thinking about that,
p74
aVbut my thoughts didn't crystallize until about a month later.
p75
aVI was having dinner with my colleague, Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner,
p76
aVand I somewhat embarrassedly told him about having broken my window,
p77
aVand, you know, forgotten my passport,
p78
aVand Danny shared with me
p79
aVthat he'd been practicing something called prospective hindsight.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VIt's something that he had gotten from the psychologist Gary Klein,
p84
aVwho had written about it a few years before,
p85
aValso called the pre-mortem.
p86
aVNow, you all know what the postmortem is.
p87
aVWhenever there's a disaster,
p88
aVa team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong, right?
p89
aVWell, in the pre-mortem, Danny explained,
p90
aVyou look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong,
p91
aVand then you try to figure out what you can do
p92
aVto prevent those things from happening, or to minimize the damage.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo what I want to talk to you about today
p95
aVare some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-mortem.
p96
aVSome of them are obvious, some of them are not so obvious.
p97
aVI'll start with the obvious ones.
p98
aa(lp99
VAround the home, designate a place for things that are easily lost.
p100
aVNow, this sounds like common sense, and it is,
p101
aVbut there's a lot of science to back this up,
p102
aVbased on the way our spatial memory works.
p103
aVThere's a structure in the brain called the hippocampus,
p104
aVthat evolved over tens of thousands of years,
p105
aVto keep track of the locations of important things \u2014
p106
aVwhere the well is, where fish can be found,
p107
aVthat stand of fruit trees,
p108
aVwhere the friendly and enemy tribes live.
p109
aVThe hippocampus is the part of the brain
p110
aVthat in London taxicab drivers becomes enlarged.
p111
aVIt's the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts.
p112
aVAnd if you're wondering, somebody actually did the experiment
p113
aVwhere they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels,
p114
aVand they could still find their nuts.
p115
aVThey weren't using smell, they were using the hippocampus,
p116
aVthis exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things.
p117
aVBut it's really good for things that don't move around much,
p118
aVnot so good for things that move around.
p119
aVSo this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports.
p120
aVSo in the home, designate a spot for your keys \u2014
p121
aVa hook by the door, maybe a decorative bowl.
p122
aVFor your passport, a particular drawer.
p123
aVFor your reading glasses, a particular table.
p124
aVIf you designate a spot and you're scrupulous about it,
p125
aVyour things will always be there when you look for them.
p126
aa(lp127
VWhat about travel?
p128
aVTake a cell phone picture of your credit cards,
p129
aVyour driver's license, your passport,
p130
aVmail it to yourself so it's in the cloud.
p131
aVIf these things are lost or stolen, you can facilitate replacement.
p132
aa(lp133
VNow these are some rather obvious things.
p134
aVRemember, when you're under stress, the brain releases cortisol.
p135
aVCortisol is toxic, and it causes cloudy thinking.
p136
aVSo part of the practice of the pre-mortem
p137
aVis to recognize that under stress you're not going to be at your best,
p138
aVand you should put systems in place.
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd there's perhaps no more stressful a situation
p141
aVthan when you're confronted with a medical decision to make.
p142
aVAnd at some point, all of us are going to be in that position,
p143
aVwhere we have to make a very important decision
p144
aVabout the future of our medical care or that of a loved one,
p145
aVto help them with a decision.
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd so I want to talk about that.
p148
aVAnd I'm going to talk about a very particular medical condition.
p149
aVBut this stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decision-making,
p150
aVand indeed for financial decision-making, and social decision-making \u2014
p151
aVany kind of decision you have to make
p152
aVthat would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts.
p153
aa(lp154
VSo suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says,
p155
aV"I just got your lab work back, your cholesterol's a little high."
p156
aVNow, you all know that high cholesterol
p157
aVis associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease,
p158
aVheart attack, stroke.
p159
aVAnd so you're thinking
p160
aVhaving high cholesterol isn't the best thing,
p161
aVand so the doctor says, "You know, I'd like to give you a drug
p162
aVthat will help you lower your cholesterol, a statin."
p163
aVAnd you've probably heard of statins,
p164
aVyou know that they're among the most widely prescribed drugs
p165
aVin the world today,
p166
aVyou probably even know people who take them.
p167
aVAnd so you're thinking, "Yeah! Give me the statin."
p168
aa(lp169
VBut there's a question you should ask at this point,
p170
aVa statistic you should ask for
p171
aVthat most doctors don't like talking about,
p172
aVand pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less.
p173
aVIt's for the number needed to treat.
p174
aVNow, what is this, the NNT?
p175
aVIt's the number of people that need to take a drug
p176
aVor undergo a surgery or any medical procedure
p177
aVbefore one person is helped.
p178
aVAnd you're thinking, what kind of crazy statistic is that?
p179
aVThe number should be one.
p180
aVMy doctor wouldn't prescribe something to me
p181
aVif it's not going to help.
p182
aVBut actually, medical practice doesn't work that way.
p183
aVAnd it's not the doctor's fault,
p184
aVif it's anybody's fault, it's the fault of scientists like me.
p185
aVWe haven't figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough.
p186
aVBut GlaxoSmithKline estimates
p187
aVthat 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people.
p188
aVSo the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin,
p189
aVwhat do you suppose it is?
p190
aVHow many people have to take it before one person is helped?
p191
aV300.
p192
aVThis is according to research
p193
aVby research practitioners Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband,
p194
aVindependently confirmed by Bloomberg.com.
p195
aVI ran through the numbers myself.
p196
aV300 people have to take the drug for a year
p197
aVbefore one heart attack, stroke or other adverse event is prevented.
p198
aa(lp199
VNow you're probably thinking,
p200
aV"Well, OK, one in 300 chance of lowering my cholesterol.
p201
aVWhy not, doc? Give me the prescription anyway."
p202
aVBut you should ask at this point for another statistic,
p203
aVand that is, "Tell me about the side effects." Right?
p204
aVSo for this particular drug,
p205
aVthe side effects occur in five percent of the patients.
p206
aVAnd they include terrible things \u2014
p207
aVdebilitating muscle and joint pain, gastrointestinal distress \u2014
p208
aVbut now you're thinking, "Five percent,
p209
aVnot very likely it's going to happen to me,
p210
aVI'll still take the drug."
p211
aVBut wait a minute.
p212
aVRemember under stress you're not thinking clearly.
p213
aVSo think about how you're going to work through this ahead of time,
p214
aVso you don't have to manufacture the chain of reasoning on the spot.
p215
aV300 people take the drug, right? One person's helped,
p216
aVfive percent of those 300 have side effects,
p217
aVthat's 15 people.
p218
aVYou're 15 times more likely to be harmed by the drug
p219
aVthan you are to be helped by the drug.
p220
aa(lp221
VNow, I'm not saying whether you should take the statin or not.
p222
aVI'm just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor.
p223
aVMedical ethics requires it,
p224
aVit's part of the principle of informed consent.
p225
aVYou have the right to have access to this kind of information
p226
aVto begin the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
p227
aa(lp228
VNow you might be thinking
p229
aVI've pulled this number out of the air for shock value,
p230
aVbut in fact it's rather typical, this number needed to treat.
p231
aVFor the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50,
p232
aVremoval of the prostate for cancer,
p233
aVthe number needed to treat is 49.
p234
aVThat's right, 49 surgeries are done for every one person who's helped.
p235
aVAnd the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients.
p236
aVThey include impotence, erectile dysfunction,
p237
aVurinary incontinence, rectal tearing,
p238
aVfecal incontinence.
p239
aVAnd if you're lucky, and you're one of the 50 percent who has these,
p240
aVthey'll only last for a year or two.
p241
aa(lp242
VSo the idea of the pre-mortem is to think ahead of time
p243
aVto the questions that you might be able to ask
p244
aVthat will push the conversation forward.
p245
aVYou don't want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot.
p246
aVAnd you also want to think about things like quality of life.
p247
aVBecause you have a choice oftentimes,
p248
aVdo you I want a shorter life that's pain-free,
p249
aVor a longer life that might have a great deal of pain towards the end?
p250
aVThese are things to talk about and think about now,
p251
aVwith your family and your loved ones.
p252
aVYou might change your mind in the heat of the moment,
p253
aVbut at least you're practiced with this kind of thinking.
p254
aa(lp255
VRemember, our brain under stress releases cortisol,
p256
aVand one of the things that happens at that moment
p257
aVis a whole bunch on systems shut down.
p258
aVThere's an evolutionary reason for this.
p259
aVFace-to-face with a predator, you don't need your digestive system,
p260
aVor your libido, or your immune system,
p261
aVbecause if you're body is expending metabolism on those things
p262
aVand you don't react quickly,
p263
aVyou might become the lion's lunch, and then none of those things matter.
p264
aVUnfortunately,
p265
aVone of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress
p266
aVis rational, logical thinking,
p267
aVas Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have shown.
p268
aVSo we need to train ourselves to think ahead
p269
aVto these kinds of situations.
p270
aa(lp271
VI think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed.
p272
aVWe all are going to fail now and then.
p273
aVThe idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be,
p274
aVto put systems in place that will help minimize the damage,
p275
aVor to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place.
p276
aa(lp277
VGetting back to that snowy night in Montreal,
p278
aVwhen I got back from my trip,
p279
aVI had my contractor install a combination lock next to the door,
p280
aVwith a key to the front door in it, an easy to remember combination.
p281
aVAnd I have to admit,
p282
aVI still have piles of mail that haven't been sorted,
p283
aVand piles of emails that I haven't gone through.
p284
aVSo I'm not completely organized,
p285
aVbut I see organization as a gradual process,
p286
aVand I'm getting there.
p287
aa(lp288
VThank you very much.

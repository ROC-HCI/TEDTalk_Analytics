VHello. Actually, that's "hello" in Bauer Bodoni
p5
aVfor the typographically hysterical amongst us.
p6
aVOne of the threads that seems to have come through
p7
aVloud and clear in the last couple of days
p8
aVis this need to reconcile what the Big wants \u2014
p9
aVthe "Big" being the organization, the system, the country \u2014
p10
aVand what the "Small" wants \u2014 the individual, the person.
p11
aVAnd how do you bring those two things together?
p12
aVCharlie Ledbetter, yesterday, I thought, talked very articulately
p13
aVabout this need to bring consumers, to bring people
p14
aVinto the process of creating things.
p15
aVAnd that's what I want to talk about today.
p16
aVSo, bringing together the Small to help facilitate and create the Big,
p17
aVI think, is something that we believe in \u2014 something I believe in,
p18
aVand something that we kind of bring to life
p19
aVthrough what we do at Ideo.
p20
aa(lp21
VI call this first chapter \u2014 for the Brits in the room \u2014
p22
aVthe "Blinding Glimpse of the Bleeding Obvious."
p23
aVOften, the good ideas are so staring-at-you-right-in-the-face
p24
aVthat you kind of miss them. And I think, a lot of times,
p25
aVwhat we do is just, sort of, hold the mirror up to our clients, and sort of go,
p26
aV"Duh! You know, look what's really going on."
p27
aVAnd rather than talk about it in the theory,
p28
aVI think I'm just going to show you an example.
p29
aVWe were asked by a large healthcare system in Minnesota
p30
aVto describe to them what their patient experience was.
p31
aVAnd I think they were expecting \u2014
p32
aVthey'd worked with lots of consultants before \u2014
p33
aVI think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart
p34
aVwith thousands of bubbles and systemic this, that and the other,
p35
aVand all kinds of mappy stuff.
p36
aVOr even worse, some kind of ghastly death-by-Powerpoint thing
p37
aVwith WowCharts and all kinds of, you know, God knows, whatever.
p38
aa(lp39
VThe first thing we actually shared with them was this.
p40
aVI'll play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve.
p41
aVThis is 59 seconds into the film.
p42
aVThis is a minute 59.
p43
aV3:19.
p44
aVI think something happens. I think a head may appear in a second.
p45
aV5:10.
p46
aV5:58.
p47
aV6:20.
p48
aVWe showed them the whole cut,
p49
aVand they were all completely, what is this?
p50
aVAnd the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day,
p51
aVall you do is look at the roof, and it's a really shitty experience.
p52
aVAnd just putting yourself in the position of the patient \u2014
p53
aa(lp54
Vthis is Christian, who works with us at Ideo.
p55
aVHe just lay in the hospital bed,
p56
aVand, kind of, stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles
p57
aVfor a really long time.
p58
aVThat's what it's like to be a patient in the hospital.
p59
aVAnd they were sort, you know, blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious.
p60
aVOh, my goodness. So, looking at the situation
p61
aVfrom the point of view of the person out \u2014
p62
aVas opposed to the traditional position of the organization in \u2014
p63
aVwas, for these guys, quite a revelation.
p64
aVAnd so, that was a really catalytic thing for them.
p65
aVSo they snapped into action.
p66
aVThey said, OK, it's not about systemic change.
p67
aVIt's not about huge, ridiculous things that we need to do.
p68
aVIt's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo we started with them prototyping some really little things
p71
aVthat we could do to have a huge amount of impact.
p72
aVThe first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror
p73
aVand we Band-Aided it here, onto a gurney, a hospital trolley,
p74
aVso that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor,
p75
aVyou could actually have a conversation with them.
p76
aVYou could, kind of, see them in your rear-view mirror,
p77
aVso it created a tiny human interaction.
p78
aVVery small example of something that they could do.
p79
aVInterestingly, the nurses themselves, sort of, snapped into action \u2014
p80
aVsaid, OK, we embrace this. What can we do?
p81
aVThe first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling.
p82
aVWhich I thought was really \u2014 I showed this to my mother recently.
p83
aVI think my mother now thinks that I'm some sort of interior decorator.
p84
aVIt's what I do for a living, sort of Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.
p85
aVNot particularly the world's best design solution
p86
aVfor those of us who are real, sort of, hard-core designers,
p87
aVbut nonetheless, a fabulous empathic solution for people.
p88
aVThings that they started doing themselves \u2014
p89
aVlike changing the floor going into the patient's room
p90
aVso that it signified, "This is my room. This is my personal space" \u2014
p91
aVwas a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo you went from public space to private space.
p94
aVAnd another idea, again, that came from one of the nurses \u2014 which I love \u2014
p95
aVwas they took traditional, sort of, corporate white boards,
p96
aVthen they put them on one wall of the patient's room,
p97
aVand they put this sticker there.
p98
aVSo that what you could actually do was go into the room
p99
aVand write messages to the person who was sick in that room,
p100
aVwhich was lovely.
p101
aVSo, tiny, tiny, tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact.
p102
aVI thought that was a really, really nice example.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo this is not particularly a new idea,
p105
aVkind of, seeing opportunities in things that are around you
p106
aVand snapping and turning them into a solution.
p107
aVIt's a history of invention based around this.
p108
aVI'm going to read this because I want to get these names right.
p109
aVJoan Ganz Cooney saw her daughter \u2014 came down on a Saturday morning,
p110
aVsaw her daughter watching the test card,
p111
aVwaiting for programs to come on one morning
p112
aVand from that came Sesame Street.
p113
aVMalcolm McLean was moving from one country to another
p114
aVand was wondering why it took these guys so long
p115
aVto get the boxes onto the ship.
p116
aVAnd he invented the shipping container.
p117
aVGeorge de Mestral \u2014 this is not bugs all over a Birkenstock \u2014
p118
aVwas walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs,
p119
aVsort of little prickly things, and from that came Velcro.
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd finally, for the Brits, Percy Shaw \u2014 this is a big British invention \u2014
p122
aVsaw the cat's eyes at the side of the road,
p123
aVwhen he was driving home one night and from that came the Catseye.
p124
aVSo there's a whole series of just using your eyes,
p125
aVseeing things for the first time, seeing things afresh
p126
aVand using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities.
p127
aVSecond one, without sounding overly Zen,
p128
aVand this is a quote from the Buddha:
p129
aV"Finding yourself in the margins, looking to the edges of things,
p130
aVis often a really interesting place to start."
p131
aVBlinkered vision tends to produce, I think, blinkered solutions.
p132
aVSo, looking wide, using your peripheral vision,
p133
aVis a really interesting place to look for opportunity.
p134
aa(lp135
VAgain, another medical example here.
p136
aVWe were asked by a device producer \u2014
p137
aVwe did the Palm Pilot and the Treo.
p138
aVWe did a lot of sexy tech at Ideo \u2014
p139
aVthey'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology
p140
aVfor medical diagnostics.
p141
aVThis was a device that a nurse uses
p142
aVwhen they're doing a spinal procedure in hospital.
p143
aVThey'll ask the nurses to input data.
p144
aVAnd they had this vision of the nurse, kind of, clicking away
p145
aVon this aluminum device
p146
aVand it all being incredibly, sort of, gadget-lustish.
p147
aVWhen we actually went and watched this procedure taking place \u2014
p148
aVand I'll explain this in a second \u2014
p149
aVit became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this
p150
aVthat they really weren't recognizing.
p151
aVWhen you're having a four-inch needle inserted into your spine \u2014
p152
aVwhich was the procedure that this device's data was about;
p153
aVit was for pain management \u2014 you're shit scared; you're freaking out.
p154
aVAnd so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did,
p155
aVwas hold the patient's hand to comfort them. Human gesture \u2014
p156
aVwhich made the fabulous two-handed data input completely impossible.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo, the thing that we designed, much less sexy
p159
aVbut much more human and practical, was this.
p160
aVSo, it's not a Palm Pilot by any stretch of the imagination,
p161
aVbut it has a thumb-scroll so you can do everything with one hand.
p162
aVSo, again, going back to this \u2014 the idea that a tiny human gesture
p163
aVdictated the design of this product.
p164
aVAnd I think that's really, really important.
p165
aVSo, again, this idea of workarounds.
p166
aVWe use this phrase "workarounds" a lot,
p167
aVsort of, looking around us. I was actually looking around the TED
p168
aVand just watching all of these kind of things happen
p169
aVwhile I've been here.
p170
aVThis idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life \u2014
p171
aVand the things we kind of do in our environment
p172
aVthat are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential \u2014
p173
aVis something that we look at a lot.
p174
aa(lp175
VWe wrote a book recently, I think you might have received it,
p176
aVcalled "Thoughtless Acts?"
p177
aVIt's been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do,
p178
aVwhich have huge intention and huge opportunity.
p179
aVWhy do we all follow the line in the street?
p180
aVThis is a picture in a Japanese subway.
p181
aVPeople consciously follow things even though, why, we don't know.
p182
aVWhy do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence?
p183
aVBecause we kind of have to \u2014 we're just compelled to.
p184
aVWe don't know why, but we do.
p185
aVWhy do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle?
p186
aVAgain, we're sort of using the world around us
p187
aVto create our own design solutions.
p188
aVAnd we're always saying to our clients: "You should look at this stuff.
p189
aVThis stuff is really important. This stuff is really vital."
p190
aVThis is people designing their own experiences.
p191
aVYou can draw from this.
p192
aVWe sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street,
p193
aVthat it's okay to use it, so we park our shopping cart there.
p194
aVIt's there for our use, on some level.
p195
aa(lp196
VSo, again, we sort of co-opt our environment
p197
aVto do all these different things.
p198
aVWe co-opt other experiences \u2014
p199
aVwe take one item and transfer it to another.
p200
aVAnd this is my favorite one. My mother used to say to me,
p201
aV"Just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn't mean you have to."
p202
aVBut, of course, we all do. We all follow each other every day.
p203
aVSo somebody assumes
p204
aVthat because somebody else has done something,
p205
aVthat's permission for them to do the same thing.
p206
aVAnd there's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time.
p207
aVI mean, shopping bag equals "parking meter out of order."
p208
aVAnd we all, kind of, know how to read these signals now.
p209
aVWe all talk to one another in this highly visual way
p210
aVwithout realizing what we're doing.
p211
aVThird section is this idea of not knowing,
p212
aVof consciously putting yourself backwards.
p213
aVI talk about unthinking situations all the time.
p214
aVSort of having beginner's mind, scraping your mind clean
p215
aVand looking at things afresh.
p216
aa(lp217
VA friend of mine was a designer at IKEA,
p218
aVand he was asked by his boss
p219
aVto help design a storage system for children.
p220
aVThis is the Billy bookcase \u2014 it's IKEA's biggest selling product.
p221
aVHammer it together. Hammer it together with a shoe, if you're me,
p222
aVbecause they're impossible to assemble.
p223
aVBut big selling bookcase. How do we replicate this for children?
p224
aVThe reality is when you actually watch children,
p225
aVchildren don't think about things like storage in linear terms.
p226
aVChildren assume permission in a very different way.
p227
aVChildren live on things. They live under things.
p228
aVThey live around things,
p229
aVand so their spatial awareness relationship,
p230
aVand their thinking around storage is totally different.
p231
aVSo the first thing you have to do \u2014 this is Graham, the designer \u2014
p232
aVis, sort of, put yourself in their shoes. And so, here he is
p233
aVsitting under the table.
p234
aVSo, what came out of this?
p235
aVThis is the storage system that he designed.
p236
aVSo what is this? I hear you all ask. No, I don't.
p237
aa(lp238
V(Laughter)
p239
aa(lp240
VIt's this, and I think this is a particularly lovely solution.
p241
aVSo, you know, it's a totally different way of looking at the situation.
p242
aVIt's a completely empathic solution \u2014
p243
aVapart from the fact that teddy's probably not loving it.
p244
aa(lp245
V(Laughter)
p246
aa(lp247
VBut a really nice way of re-framing the ordinary,
p248
aVand I think that's one of the things.
p249
aVAnd putting yourself in the position of the person,
p250
aVand I think that's one of the threads that I've heard again
p251
aVfrom this conference is how do we put ourselves
p252
aVin other peoples' shoes and really feel what they feel?
p253
aVAnd then use that information to fuel solutions?
p254
aVAnd I think that's what this is very much about.
p255
aVLast section: green armband. We've all got them.
p256
aVIt's about this really.
p257
aVI mean, it's about picking battles big enough to matter
p258
aVbut small enough to win.
p259
aVAgain, that's one of the themes
p260
aVthat I think has come through loud and clear in this conference
p261
aVis: Where do we start? How do we start? What do we do to start?
p262
aVSo, again, we were asked to design a water pump
p263
aVfor a company called ApproTEC, in Kenya.
p264
aVThey're now called KickStart.
p265
aa(lp266
VAnd, again, as designers,
p267
aVwe wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful
p268
aVand spend a lot of time thinking of the form.
p269
aVAnd that was completely irrelevant.
p270
aVWhen you put yourself in the position of these people,
p271
aVthings like the fact that this has to be able to fold up
p272
aVand fit on a bicycle, become much more relevant
p273
aVthan the form of it. The way it's produced,
p274
aVit has to be produced with indigenous manufacturing methods
p275
aVand indigenous materials.
p276
aVSo it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user.
p277
aVWe had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world.
p278
aVSo what seems like a very clunky product
p279
aVis, in fact, incredibly useful.
p280
aVIt's powered a bit like a Stairmaster \u2014 you pump up and down on it.
p281
aVChildren can use it. Adults can use it. Everybody uses it.
p282
aVIt's turning these guys \u2014 again, one of the themes \u2014
p283
aVit's turning them into entrepreneurs.
p284
aa(lp285
VThese guys are using this very successfully.
p286
aVAnd for us, it's been great
p287
aVbecause it's won loads of design awards.
p288
aVSo we actually managed to reconcile the needs of the design company,
p289
aVthe needs of the individuals in the company,
p290
aVto feel good about a product we were actually designing,
p291
aVand the needs of the individuals we were designing it for.
p292
aVThere it is, pumping water from 30 feet.
p293
aVSo as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets
p294
aVto all of you this morning.
p295
aVWe've made a donation on everybody's behalf here
p296
aVto kick start, no pun intended, their next project.
p297
aVBecause, again, I think, sort of, putting our money where our mouth is, here.
p298
aVWe feel that this is an important gesture.
p299
aVSo we've handed out bracelets. Small is the new big.
p300
aVI hope you'll all wear them.
p301
aVSo that's it. Thank you.

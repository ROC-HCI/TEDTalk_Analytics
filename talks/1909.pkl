VSo when I was in Morocco,
p5
aVin Casablanca, not so long ago,
p6
aVI met a young unmarried mother called Faiza.
p7
aVFaiza showed me photos of her infant son
p8
aVand she told me the story of his conception, pregnancy, and delivery.
p9
aa(lp10
VIt was a remarkable tale,
p11
aVbut Faiza saved the best for last.
p12
aV"You know, I am a virgin," she told me.
p13
aV"I have two medical certificates to prove it."
p14
aa(lp15
VThis is the modern Middle East,
p16
aVwhere two millennia after the coming of Christ,
p17
aVvirgin births are still a fact of life.
p18
aa(lp19
VFaiza's story is just one of hundreds I've heard  over the years, traveling across the Arab region
p20
aVtalking to people about sex.
p21
aVNow, I know this might sound like a dream job,
p22
aVor possibly a highly dubious occupation,
p23
aa(lp24
Vbut for me, it's something else altogether.
p25
aVI'm half Egyptian, and I'm Muslim.
p26
aVBut I grew up in Canada, far from my Arab roots.
p27
aa(lp28
VLike so many who straddle East and West,
p29
aVI've been drawn, over the years, to try to better understand my origins.
p30
aVThat I chose to look at sex comes from  my background in HIV/AIDS,
p31
aVas a writer and a researcher and an activist.
p32
aVSex lies at the heart of an emerging epidemic in the Middle East and North Africa,
p33
aVwhich is one of only two regions in the world where HIV/AIDS is still on the rise.
p34
aa(lp35
VNow sexuality is an incredibly powerful lens
p36
aVwith which to study any society,
p37
aVbecause what happens in our intimate lives
p38
aVis reflected by forces on a bigger stage:
p39
aVin politics and economics, in religion and tradition,  in gender and generations.
p40
aVAs I found, if you really want to know a people,
p41
aVyou start by looking inside their bedrooms.
p42
aa(lp43
VNow to be sure, the Arab world is vast and varied.
p44
aVBut running across it are three red lines \u2014
p45
aVthese are topics you are not supposed  to challenge in word or deed.
p46
aa(lp47
VThe first of these is politics.
p48
aVBut the Arab Spring has changed all that,
p49
aVin uprisings which have blossomed  across the region since 2011.
p50
aVNow while those in power, old and new,
p51
aVcontinue to cling to business as usual,
p52
aVmillions are still pushing back,
p53
aVand pushing forward to what they hope will be a better life.
p54
aa(lp55
VThat second red line is religion.
p56
aVBut now religion and politics are connected,
p57
aVwith the rise of such groups as the  Muslim Brotherhood.
p58
aVAnd some people, at least, are starting  to ask questions
p59
aVabout the role of Islam in public and private life.
p60
aa(lp61
VYou know, as for that third red line,  that off-limits subject,
p62
aVwhat do you think it might be?
p63
aa(lp64
VAudience: Sex.
p65
aa(lp66
VShereen El Feki: Louder, I can't hear you.
p67
aa(lp68
VAudience: Sex.
p69
aa(lp70
VSEF: Again, please don't be shy.
p71
aa(lp72
VAudience: Sex.
p73
aa(lp74
VSEF: Absolutely, that's right, it's sex. (Laughter)
p75
aVAcross the Arab region, the only accepted context for sex is marriage \u2014
p76
aVapproved by your parents, sanctioned by religion
p77
aVand registered by the state.
p78
aVMarriage is your ticket to adulthood.
p79
aVIf you don't tie the knot, you can't  move out of your parents' place,
p80
aVand you're not supposed to be having sex,
p81
aVand you're definitely not supposed  to be having children.
p82
aa(lp83
VIt's a social citadel; it's an impregnable fortress
p84
aVwhich resists any assault, any alternative.
p85
aVAnd around the fortress is this vast field of taboo
p86
aVagainst premarital sex, against condoms,
p87
aVagainst abortion, against homosexuality,
p88
aVyou name it.
p89
aa(lp90
VFaiza was living proof of this.
p91
aVHer virginity statement was  not a piece of wishful thinking.
p92
aVAlthough the major religions of the region extoll premarital chastity,
p93
aVin a patriarchy, boys will be boys.
p94
aVMen have sex before marriage,
p95
aVand people more or less turn a blind eye.
p96
aa(lp97
VNot so for women,
p98
aVwho are expected to be virgins  on their wedding night \u2014
p99
aVthat is, to turn up with your hymen intact.
p100
aVThis is not a question of individual concern,
p101
aVthis is a matter of family honor,  and in particular, men's honor.
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd so women and their relatives
p104
aVwill go to great lengths to preserve  this tiny piece of anatomy \u2014
p105
aVfrom female genital mutilation,
p106
aVto virginity testing, to hymen repair surgery.
p107
aa(lp108
VFaiza chose a different route:
p109
aVnon-vaginal sex.
p110
aVOnly she became pregnant all the same.
p111
aVBut Faiza didn't actually realize this,
p112
aVbecause there's so little  sexuality education in schools,
p113
aVand so little communication in the family.
p114
aa(lp115
VWhen her condition became hard to hide,
p116
aVFaiza's mother helped her flee  her father and brothers.
p117
aVThis is because honor killings are a real threat
p118
aVfor untold numbers of women in the Arab region.
p119
aVAnd so when Faiza eventually fetched up at  a hospital in Casablanca,
p120
aVthe man who offered to help her,
p121
aVinstead tried to rape her.
p122
aa(lp123
VSadly, Faiza is not alone.
p124
aVIn Egypt, where my research is focused,
p125
aVI have seen plenty of trouble  in and out of the citadel.
p126
aVThere are legions of young men
p127
aVwho can't afford to get married,
p128
aVbecause marriage has become  a very expensive proposition.
p129
aVThey are expected to bear the burden of costs in married life,
p130
aVbut they can't find jobs.
p131
aVThis is one of the major drivers  of the recent uprisings,
p132
aVand it is one of the reasons for the  rising age of marriage
p133
aVin much of the Arab region.
p134
aa(lp135
VThere are career women who want to get married,
p136
aVbut can't find a husband,
p137
aVbecause they defy gender expectations,
p138
aVor as one young female doctor  in Tunisia put it to me,
p139
aV"The women, they are becoming more and more open.
p140
aVBut the man, he is still at the prehistoric stage."
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd then there are men and women who  cross the heterosexual line,
p143
aVwho have sex with their own sex,
p144
aVor who have a different gender identity.
p145
aVThey are on the receiving end of laws which punish their activities,
p146
aVeven their appearance.
p147
aVAnd they face a daily struggle with social stigma,
p148
aVwith family despair,
p149
aVand with religious fire and brimstone.
p150
aa(lp151
VNow, it's not as if it's all rosy  in the marital bed either.
p152
aVCouples who are looking for greater happiness,
p153
aVgreater sexual happiness in their married lives,
p154
aVbut are at a loss of how to achieve it,
p155
aVespecially wives, who are afraid  of being seen as bad women
p156
aVif they show some spark in the bedroom.
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd then there are those whose marriages
p159
aVare actually a veil for prostitution.
p160
aVThey have been sold by their families,
p161
aVoften to wealthy Arab tourists.
p162
aVThis is just one face of a booming  sex trade across the Arab region.
p163
aa(lp164
VNow raise your hand if any of  this is sounding familiar to you,
p165
aVfrom your part of the world.
p166
aVYeah. It's not as if the Arab world has a monopoly on sexual hangups.
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd although we don't yet have an Arab Kinsey Report
p169
aVto tell us exactly what's happening  inside bedrooms across the Arab region,
p170
aVIt's pretty clear that  something is not right.
p171
aVDouble standards for men and women,
p172
aVsex as a source of shame,
p173
aVfamily control limiting individual choices,
p174
aVand a vast gulf between appearance and reality:
p175
aVwhat people are doing
p176
aVand what they're willing to admit to,
p177
aVand a general reluctance to move  beyond private whispers
p178
aVto a serious and sustained public discussion.
p179
aa(lp180
VAs one doctor in Cairo summed it up for me,
p181
aV"Here, sex is the opposite of sport.
p182
aVFootball, everybody talks about it,
p183
aVbut hardly anyone plays.
p184
aVBut sex, everybody is doing it,
p185
aVbut nobody wants to talk about it." (Laughter)
p186
aa(lp187
V(Music) (In Arabic)
p188
aa(lp189
VSEF: I want to give you a piece of advice,
p190
aVwhich if you follow it, will make you happy in life.
p191
aa(lp192
VWhen your husband reaches out to you,
p193
aVwhen he seizes a part of your body,
p194
aVsigh deeply and look at him lustily.
p195
aa(lp196
VWhen he penetrates you with his penis,
p197
aVtry to talk flirtatiously and  move yourself in harmony with him.
p198
aa(lp199
VHot stuff!
p200
aVAnd it might sound that these handy hints
p201
aVcome from "The Joy of Sex" or YouPorn.
p202
aVBut in fact, they come from a 10th-century Arabic book
p203
aVcalled "The Encyclopedia of Pleasure,"
p204
aVwhich covers sex from aphrodisiacs to zoophilia,
p205
aVand everything in between.
p206
aa(lp207
VThe Encyclopedia is just one  in a long line of Arabic erotica,
p208
aVmuch of it written by religious scholars.
p209
aVGoing right back to the Prophet Muhammad,
p210
aVthere is a rich tradition in Islam
p211
aVof talking frankly about sex:
p212
aVnot just its problems, but also its pleasures,
p213
aVand not just for men, but also for women.
p214
aVA thousand years ago, we used to have  whole dictionaries of sex in Arabic.
p215
aVWords to cover every conceivable sexual feature,
p216
aVposition and preference, a body of language
p217
aVthat was rich enough to make up the body  of the woman you see on this page.
p218
aa(lp219
VToday, this history is largely unknown  in the Arab region.
p220
aVEven by educated people, who often feel more comfortable talking about sex
p221
aVin a foreign language than they do in their own tongue.
p222
aVToday's sexual landscape looks a lot like Europe and America
p223
aVon the brink of the sexual revolution.
p224
aa(lp225
VBut while the West has opened on sex,
p226
aVwhat we found is that Arab societies appear to have been moving in the opposite direction.
p227
aVIn Egypt and many of its neighbors,
p228
aVthis closing down is part of a wider closing
p229
aVin political, social and cultural thought.
p230
aVAnd it is the product of a complex historical process,
p231
aVone which has gained ground with the rise  of Islamic conservatism
p232
aVsince the late 1970s.
p233
aV"Just say no" is what conservatives  around the world
p234
aVsay to any challenge to the sexual status quo.
p235
aVIn the Arab region, they brand these attempts as a Western conspiracy
p236
aVto undermine traditional Arab and Islamic values.
p237
aVBut what's really at stake here
p238
aVis one of their most powerful tools of control:
p239
aVsex wrapped up in religion.
p240
aa(lp241
VBut history shows us that  even as recently
p242
aVas our fathers' and grandfathers' day,
p243
aVthere have been times of greater pragmatism,
p244
aVand tolerance, and a willingness to consider other interpretations:
p245
aVbe it abortion, or masturbation, or even  the incendiary topic of homosexuality.
p246
aVIt is not black and white, as conservatives would have us believe.
p247
aVIn these, as in so many other matters,
p248
aVIslam offers us at least 50 shades of gray.
p249
aV(Laughter)
p250
aa(lp251
VOver my travels,
p252
aVI've met men and women  across the Arab region
p253
aVwho've been exploring that spectrum \u2014
p254
aVsexologists who are trying to help couples
p255
aVfind greater happiness in their marriages,
p256
aVinnovators who are managing to get  sexuality education into schools,
p257
aVsmall groups of men and women,
p258
aVlesbian, gay, transgendered, transsexual,
p259
aVwho are reaching out to their peers
p260
aVwith online initiatives and real-world support.
p261
aVWomen, and increasingly men, who are starting to speak out
p262
aVand push back against sexual violence
p263
aVon the streets and in the home.
p264
aVGroups that are trying to help sex workers protect themselves against HIV
p265
aVand other occupational hazards,
p266
aVand NGOs that are helping unwed mothers like Faiza
p267
aVfind a place in society, and critically, stay with their kids.
p268
aa(lp269
VNow these efforts are small,  they're often underfunded,
p270
aVand they face formidable opposition.
p271
aVBut I am optimistic that, in the long run,
p272
aVtimes are changing, and they and their ideas
p273
aVwill gain ground.
p274
aVSocial change doesn't happen in the Arab region through dramatic confrontation,
p275
aVbeating or indeed baring of breasts,
p276
aVbut rather through negotiation.
p277
aa(lp278
VWhat we're talking here is not about a  sexual revolution,
p279
aVbut a sexual evolution,  learning from other parts of the world,
p280
aVadapting to local conditions,
p281
aVforging our own path, not following one blazed by another.
p282
aVThat path, I hope, will one day lead us  to the right to control our own bodies,
p283
aVand to access the information  and services we need
p284
aVto lead satisfying and safe sexual lives.
p285
aVThe right to express our ideas freely,
p286
aVto marry whom we choose,  to choose our own partners,
p287
aVto be sexually active or not, to decide whether to have children and when,
p288
aVall this without violence or force or discrimination.
p289
aa(lp290
VNow we are very far from this  across the Arab region,
p291
aVand so much needs to change:
p292
aVlaw, education, media, the economy,
p293
aVthe list goes on and on,
p294
aVand it is the work of a generation, at least.
p295
aa(lp296
VBut it begins with a journey that I myself have made,
p297
aVasking hard questions of received wisdoms
p298
aVin sexual life.
p299
aVAnd it is a journey which has only served to strengthen my faith,
p300
aVand my appreciation of local histories and cultures
p301
aVby showing me possibilities  where I once only saw absolutes.
p302
aa(lp303
VNow given the turmoil in many countries in the Arab region,
p304
aVtalking about sex,  challenging the taboos,
p305
aVseeking alternatives might sound like something of a luxury.
p306
aa(lp307
VBut at this critical moment in history,
p308
aVif we do not anchor freedom and justice,
p309
aVdignity and equality,
p310
aVprivacy and autonomy in our personal lives, in our sexual lives,
p311
aVwe will find it very hard to achieve in public life.
p312
aa(lp313
VThe political and the sexual are intimate bedfellows, and that is true for us all.
p314
aVno matter where we live and love.
p315
aa(lp316
VThank you.
p317
aa(lp318

VFour years ago, on the TED stage,
p5
aVI announced a company I was working with at the time
p6
aVcalled Odeo.
p7
aVAnd because of that announcement,
p8
aVwe got a big article in The New York Times,
p9
aVwhich led to more press, which led to more attention,
p10
aVand me deciding to become CEO of that company \u2014
p11
aVwhereas I was just an adviser \u2014
p12
aVand raising a round of venture capital
p13
aVand ramping up hiring.
p14
aa(lp15
VOne of the guys I hired was an engineer named Jack Dorsey,
p16
aVand a year later, when we were trying to decide which way to go with Odeo,
p17
aVJack presented an idea he'd been tinkering around with for a number of years
p18
aVthat was based around sending simple status updates to friends.
p19
aVWe were also playing with SMS at the time at Odeo,
p20
aVso we kind of put two and two together,
p21
aVand in early 2006 we launched Twitter as a side project at Odeo.
p22
aa(lp23
VNow, it's hard to justify doing a side project
p24
aVat a startup, where focus is so critical,
p25
aVbut I had actually launched Blogger as a side project
p26
aVto my previous company,
p27
aVthinking it was just a little thing we'd do on the side,
p28
aVand it ended up taking over not only the company,
p29
aVbut my life for the next five or six years.
p30
aVSo I learned to follow hunches
p31
aVeven though you can't necessarily justify them
p32
aVor know where they're going to go.
p33
aVAnd that's kind of what's happened with Twitter, time after time.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo, for those of you unfamiliar,
p36
aVTwitter is based around a very simple, seemingly trivial concept.
p37
aVYou say what you're doing in 140 characters or less,
p38
aVand people who are interested in you get those updates.
p39
aVIf they're really interested,
p40
aVthey get the update as a text message on their cell phone.
p41
aVSo, for instance, I may Twitter right now
p42
aVthat I'm giving a talk at TED.
p43
aVAnd in my case, when I hit send,
p44
aVup to 60,000 people will receive that message in a matter of seconds.
p45
aVNow, the fundamental idea is that Twitter
p46
aVlets people share moments of their lives
p47
aVwhenever they want,
p48
aVbe they momentous occasions
p49
aVor mundane ones.
p50
aVIt is by sharing these moments as they're happening
p51
aVthat lets people feel more connected and in touch,
p52
aVdespite distance, and in real time.
p53
aVThis is the primary use we saw of Twitter from the beginning,
p54
aVand what got us excited.
p55
aa(lp56
VWhat we didn't anticipate was the many, many other uses
p57
aVthat would evolve from this very simple system.
p58
aVOne of the things we realized
p59
aVwas how important Twitter could be during real-time events.
p60
aVWhen the wildfires broke out in San Diego,
p61
aVin October of 2007,
p62
aVpeople turned to Twitter to report what was happening
p63
aVand to find information from neighbors
p64
aVabout what was happening around them.
p65
aa(lp66
VBut it wasn't just individuals.
p67
aVThe L.A. Times actually turned to Twitter to dispense information as well,
p68
aVand put a Twitter feed on the front page,
p69
aVand the L.A. Fire Department and Red Cross
p70
aVused it to dispense news and updates as well.
p71
aVAt this event, dozens of people here are Twittering
p72
aVand thousands of people around the world are following along
p73
aVbecause they want to know what it feels like to be here
p74
aVand what's happening.
p75
aa(lp76
VAmong the other interesting things that have cropped up
p77
aa(lp78
Vare many things from businesses,
p79
aa(lp80
Vfrom marketing and communications and predictable things,
p81
aVto an insanely popular Korean-barbecue taco truck
p82
aVthat drives around L.A. and Twitters where it stops,
p83
aVcausing a line to form around the block.
p84
aa(lp85
VPoliticians have recently begun Twittering.
p86
aVIn fact, there are 47 members of Congress
p87
aVwho currently have Twitter accounts.
p88
aVAnd they're tweeting, in some cases,
p89
aVfrom behind closed-door sessions with the President.
p90
aVIn this case, this guy's not liking what he's hearing.
p91
aVThe President himself is our most popular Twitter user,
p92
aValthough his tweets have dropped off as of late,
p93
aVwhile Senator McCain's have picked up.
p94
aVAs have this guy's.
p95
aa(lp96
VTwitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium:
p97
aVyou send one message and it goes out to everybody,
p98
aVand you receive the messages you're interested in.
p99
aVOne of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of Twitter
p100
aVwas by inventing a way to reply to a specific person
p101
aVor a specific message.
p102
aVSo, this syntax, the "@username" that Shaquille O'Neal's using here
p103
aVto reply to one of his fans,
p104
aVwas completely invented by users,
p105
aVand we didn't build it into the system until it already became popular
p106
aVand then we made it easier.
p107
aVThis is one of the many ways that users have shaped the system.
p108
aa(lp109
VAnother is via the API.
p110
aVWe built an application-programming interface,
p111
aVwhich basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with Twitter.
p112
aVWe currently know about over 2,000 pieces of software
p113
aVthat can send Twitter updates \u2014
p114
aVinterfaces for Mac, Windows, your iPhone, your BlackBerry \u2014
p115
aVas well as things like
p116
aVa device that lets an unborn baby Twitter when it kicks
p117
aVor a plant Twitter when it needs water.
p118
aa(lp119
VProbably the most important third-party development
p120
aVcame from a little company in Virginia called Summize.
p121
aVSummize built a Twitter search engine.
p122
aVAnd they tapped into the fact
p123
aVthat, if you have millions of people around the world
p124
aVtalking about what they're doing and what's around them,
p125
aVyou have an incredible resource to find out about any topic or event
p126
aVwhile it's going on.
p127
aVThis really changed how we perceived Twitter.
p128
aVFor instance, here's what people are saying about TED.
p129
aVThis is another way that our mind was shifted,
p130
aVand Twitter wasn't what we thought it was.
p131
aVWe liked this so much we actually bought the company
p132
aVand are folding it into the main product.
p133
aVThis not only lets you view Twitters in different ways,
p134
aVbut it introduces new use cases as well.
p135
aVOne of my favorites is what happened a few months ago
p136
aVwhen there was a gas shortage in Atlanta.
p137
aVSome users figured out
p138
aVthat they would Twitter when they found gas \u2014
p139
aVwhere it was, and how much it cost \u2014
p140
aVand then appended the keyword "#atlgas"
p141
aVwhich let other people search for that and find gas themselves.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd this trend of people using this communication network
p144
aVto help each other out
p145
aVgoes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends.
p146
aVIt's happened more and more lately,
p147
aVwhether it's raising money for homeless people
p148
aVor to dig wells in Africa
p149
aVor for a family in crisis.
p150
aVPeople have raised tens of thousands of dollars over Twitter
p151
aVin a matter of days on several occasions.
p152
aVIt seems like when you give people easier ways to share information,
p153
aVmore good things happen.
p154
aa(lp155
VI have no idea what will happen next with Twitter.
p156
aVI've learned to follow the hunch,
p157
aVbut never assume where it will go.
p158
aVThanks.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Applause)
p161
aa(lp162
VChris Anderson: We're not quite done yet.
p163
aVSo, look, if we could have this screen live.
p164
aVThis is actually the most terrifying thing that any speaker can do
p165
aVafter they've been to an event.
p166
aVIt's totally intimidating.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo, this would be the Twitter search screen.
p169
aVSo we're going to just type a couple of random words into Twitter.
p170
aVFor example: "Evan Williams."
p171
aV"Evan Williams, give people more good ways to share information and follow your hunch at TED."
p172
aV"Currently listening to Evan Williams." "Currently listening to Evan Williams." "Evan Williams \u2014"
p173
aVOh.
p174
aV"Evan Williams is just dying on stage here at TED.
p175
aVWorst talk ever!" (Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VEvan Williams: Nice. Thanks.
p178
aa(lp179
VCA: Just kidding.
p180
aa(lp181
VBut, literally in the eight minutes he was talking,
p182
aVthere are about fifty tweets that already came on the talk.
p183
aVSo he'll see every aspect of the reaction:
p184
aVthe fact that Barack Obama is the biggest Twitterer,
p185
aVthe fact that it came out of TED.
p186
aVI don't think there's any other way of getting instant feedback that way.
p187
aa(lp188
VYou have build something very fascinating,
p189
aVand it looks like its best times are still ahead of it.
p190
aVSo, thank you very much, Evan. EW: Thank you.
p191
aVCA: That was very interesting.

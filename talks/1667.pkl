VRadical openness is still a distant future
p5
aVin the field of school education.
p6
aVWe have such a hard time figuring out
p7
aVthat learning is not a place but an activity.
p8
aa(lp9
VBut I want to tell you the story of PISA,
p10
aVOECD's test to measure the knowledge and skills
p11
aVof 15-year-olds around the world,
p12
aVand it's really a story of how international comparisons
p13
aVhave globalized the field of education that we usually treat
p14
aVas an affair of domestic policy.
p15
aa(lp16
VLook at how the world looked in the 1960s,
p17
aVin terms of the proportion of people
p18
aVwho had completed high school.
p19
aVYou can see the United States ahead of everyone else,
p20
aVand much of the economic success of the United States
p21
aVdraws on its long-standing advantage
p22
aVas the first mover in education.
p23
aVBut in the 1970s, some countries caught up.
p24
aVIn the 1980s, the global expansion
p25
aVof the talent pool continued.
p26
aVAnd the world didn't stop in the 1990s.
p27
aVSo in the '60s, the U.S. was first.
p28
aVIn the '90s, it was 13th,
p29
aVand not because standards had fallen,
p30
aVbut because they had risen so much faster elsewhere.
p31
aa(lp32
VKorea shows you what's possible in education.
p33
aVTwo generations ago, Korea had the standard of living
p34
aVof Afghanistan today,
p35
aVand was one of the lowest education performers.
p36
aVToday, every young Korean finishes high school.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo this tells us that, in a global economy,
p39
aVit is no longer national improvement that's the benchmark for success,
p40
aVbut the best performing education systems internationally.
p41
aVThe trouble is that
p42
aVmeasuring how much time people spend in school
p43
aVor what degree they have got is not always
p44
aVa good way of seeing what they can actually do.
p45
aVLook at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets,
p46
aVwhile employers say they cannot find the people
p47
aVwith the skills they need.
p48
aVAnd that tells you that better degrees don't automatically translate
p49
aVinto better skills and better jobs and better lives.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo with PISA, we try to change this
p52
aVby measuring the knowledge and skills
p53
aVof people directly.
p54
aVAnd we took a very special angle to this.
p55
aVWe were less interested in whether students can simply
p56
aVreproduce what they have learned in school,
p57
aVbut we wanted to test whether they can extrapolate
p58
aVfrom what they know
p59
aVand apply their knowledge in novel situations.
p60
aVNow, some people have criticized us for this.
p61
aVThey say, you know, such a way of measuring outcomes
p62
aVis terribly unfair to people, because we test students
p63
aVwith problems they haven't seen before.
p64
aVBut if you take that logic, you know,
p65
aVyou should consider life unfair, because
p66
aVthe test of truth in life is not whether we can remember
p67
aVwhat we learned in school,
p68
aVbut whether we are prepared for change,
p69
aVwhether we are prepared for jobs that haven't been created,
p70
aVto use technologies that haven't been invented,
p71
aVto solve problems we just can't anticipate today.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd once hotly contested,
p74
aVour way of measuring outcomes has actually quickly become the standard.
p75
aVIn our latest assessment in 2009,
p76
aVwe measured 74 school systems
p77
aVthat together cover 87 percent of the economy.
p78
aVThis chart shows you the performance of countries.
p79
aVIn red, sort of below OECD average.
p80
aVYellow is so-so, and in green are the countries doing really well.
p81
aVYou can see Shanghai, Korea, Singapore in Asia;
p82
aVFinland in Europe;
p83
aVCanada in North America doing really well.
p84
aVYou can also see that there is a gap of almost
p85
aVthree and a half school years between
p86
aV15-year-olds in Shanghai and 15-year-olds in Chile,
p87
aVand the gap grows to seven school years
p88
aVwhen you include the countries with really poor performance.
p89
aVThere's a world of difference in the way in which
p90
aVyoung people are prepared for today's economy.
p91
aa(lp92
VBut I want to introduce a second important dimension
p93
aVinto this picture.
p94
aVEducators like to talk about equity.
p95
aVWith PISA, we wanted to measure how they actually deliver equity,
p96
aVin terms of ensuring that people
p97
aVfrom different social backgrounds have equal chances.
p98
aVAnd we see that in some countries, the impact
p99
aVof social background on learning outcomes
p100
aVis very, very strong.
p101
aVOpportunities are unequally distributed.
p102
aVA lot of potential of young children is wasted.
p103
aVWe see in other countries that it matters much less
p104
aVinto which social context you're born.
p105
aVWe all want to be there, in the upper right quadrant,
p106
aVwhere performance is strong and learning opportunities are equally distributed.
p107
aVNobody, and no country, can afford to be there,
p108
aVwhere performance is poor
p109
aVand there are large social disparities.
p110
aVAnd then we can debate, you know, is it better
p111
aVto be there, where performance is strong
p112
aVat the price of large disparities?
p113
aVOr do we want to focus on equity and accept mediocrity?
p114
aVBut actually, if you look at how countries come out on this picture,
p115
aVyou see there are a lot of countries that actually
p116
aVare combining excellence with equity.
p117
aVIn fact, one of the most important lessons from this comparison
p118
aVis that you don't have to compromise equity
p119
aVto achieve excellence.
p120
aVThese countries have moved on from providing excellence
p121
aVfor just some to providing excellence for all,
p122
aVa very important lesson.
p123
aVAnd that also challenges the paradigms of many school systems
p124
aVthat believe they are mainly there to sort people.
p125
aVAnd ever since those results came out, policymakers,
p126
aVeducators, researchers from around the world
p127
aVhave tried to figure out
p128
aVwhat's behind the success of those systems.
p129
aa(lp130
VBut let's step back for a moment
p131
aVand focus on the countries that actually started PISA,
p132
aVand I'm giving them a colored bubble now.
p133
aVAnd I'm making the size of the bubble
p134
aVproportional
p135
aVto the amount of money that countries spent on students.
p136
aVIf money would tell you everything
p137
aVabout the quality of learning outcomes,
p138
aVyou would find all the large bubbles at the top, no?
p139
aVBut that's not what you see.
p140
aVSpending per student only explains about,
p141
aVwell, less than 20 percent
p142
aVof the performance variation among countries,
p143
aVand Luxembourg, for example, the most expensive system,
p144
aVdoesn't do particularly well.
p145
aVWhat you see is that two countries with similar spending
p146
aVachieve very different results.
p147
aVYou also see \u2014 and I think that's one of the most encouraging findings \u2014
p148
aVthat we no longer live in a world that is neatly divided
p149
aVbetween rich and well-educated countries,
p150
aVand poor and badly-educated ones,
p151
aVa very, very important lesson.
p152
aa(lp153
VLet's look at this in greater detail.
p154
aVThe red dot shows you
p155
aVspending per student relative to a country's wealth.
p156
aVOne way you can spend money is by paying teachers well,
p157
aVand you can see Korea investing a lot
p158
aVin attracting the best people into the teaching profession.
p159
aVAnd Korea also invests into long school days,
p160
aVwhich drives up costs further.
p161
aVLast but not least, Koreans want their teachers
p162
aVnot only to teach but also to develop.
p163
aVThey invest in professional development and collaboration
p164
aVand many other things.
p165
aVAll that costs money.
p166
aVHow can Korea afford all of this?
p167
aVThe answer is, students in Korea learn in large classes.
p168
aVThis is the blue bar which is driving costs down.
p169
aVYou go to the next country on the list, Luxembourg,
p170
aVand you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for Korea,
p171
aVso Luxembourg spends the same per student as Korea does.
p172
aVBut, you know, parents and teachers and policymakers
p173
aVin Luxembourg all like small classes.
p174
aVYou know, it's very pleasant to walk into a small class.
p175
aVSo they have invested all their money into there,
p176
aVand the blue bar, class size, is driving costs up.
p177
aVBut even Luxembourg can spend its money only once,
p178
aVand the price for this is that
p179
aVteachers are not paid particularly well.
p180
aVStudents don't have long hours of learning.
p181
aVAnd basically, teachers have little time to do anything else than teaching.
p182
aVSo you can see two countries spent their money very differently,
p183
aVand actually how they spent their money
p184
aVmatters a lot more than how much they invest in education.
p185
aa(lp186
VLet's go back to the year 2000.
p187
aVRemember, that was the year before the iPod was invented.
p188
aVThis is how the world looked then
p189
aVin terms of PISA performance.
p190
aVThe first thing you can see is that the bubbles were a lot smaller, no?
p191
aVWe spent a lot less on education,
p192
aVabout 35 percent less on education.
p193
aVSo you ask yourself, if education has become so much more expensive,
p194
aVhas it become so much better?
p195
aVAnd the bitter truth really is that, you know,
p196
aVnot in many countries.
p197
aVBut there are some countries which have seen
p198
aVimpressive improvements.
p199
aVGermany, my own country, in the year 2000,
p200
aVfeatured in the lower quadrant,
p201
aVbelow average performance, large social disparities.
p202
aVAnd remember, Germany, we used to be one of those countries
p203
aVthat comes out very well when you just count people who have degrees.
p204
aVVery disappointing results.
p205
aVPeople were stunned by the results.
p206
aVAnd for the very first time, the public debate in Germany
p207
aVwas dominated for months by education,
p208
aVnot tax, not other kinds of issues, but education
p209
aVwas the center of the public debate.
p210
aVAnd then policymakers began to respond to this.
p211
aVThe federal government dramatically raised its investment in education.
p212
aVA lot was done to increase the life chances of students
p213
aVwith an immigrant background or from social disadvantage.
p214
aVAnd what's really interesting is that this wasn't just about
p215
aVoptimizing existing policies,
p216
aVbut data transformed some of the beliefs and paradigms
p217
aVunderlying German education.
p218
aVFor example, traditionally, the education of the very young children
p219
aVwas seen as the business of families, and you would have cases
p220
aVwhere women were seen as neglecting their family responsibilities
p221
aVwhen they sent their children to kindergarten.
p222
aVPISA has transformed that debate,
p223
aVand pushed early childhood education right at the center
p224
aVof public policy in Germany.
p225
aVOr traditionally, the German education divides children
p226
aVat the age of 10, very young children,
p227
aVbetween those deemed to pursue careers of knowledge workers
p228
aVand those who would end up working for the knowledge workers,
p229
aVand that mainly along socioeconomic lines,
p230
aVand that paradigm is being challenged now too.
p231
aVA lot of change.
p232
aa(lp233
VAnd the good news is, nine years later,
p234
aVyou can see improvements in quality and equity.
p235
aVPeople have taken up the challenge, done something about it.
p236
aa(lp237
VOr take Korea, at the other end of the spectrum.
p238
aVIn the year 2000, Korea did already very well,
p239
aVbut the Koreans were concerned that only a small share
p240
aVof their students achieved the really high levels of excellence.
p241
aVThey took up the challenge,
p242
aVand Korea was able to double the proportion of students
p243
aVachieving excellence in one decade in the field of reading.
p244
aVWell, if you only focus on your brightest students,
p245
aVyou know what happens is disparities grow,
p246
aVand you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction,
p247
aVbut still, an impressive improvement.
p248
aa(lp249
VA major overhaul of Poland's education
p250
aVhelped to dramatically reduce between variability among schools,
p251
aVturn around many of the lowest-performing schools,
p252
aVand raise performance by over half a school year.
p253
aVAnd you can see other countries as well.
p254
aVPortugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system,
p255
aVraise quality and improve equity,
p256
aVand so did Hungary.
p257
aa(lp258
VSo what you can actually see, there's been a lot of change.
p259
aVAnd even those people who complain and say that
p260
aVthe relative standing of countries
p261
aVon something like PISA is just an artifact of culture,
p262
aVof economic factors, of social issues,
p263
aVof homogeneity of societies, and so on,
p264
aVthese people must now concede that education improvement is possible.
p265
aVYou know, Poland hasn't changed its culture.
p266
aVIt didn't change its economy. It didn't change
p267
aVthe compositions of its population.
p268
aVIt didn't fire its teachers. It changed its education policies
p269
aVand practice. Very impressive.
p270
aa(lp271
VAnd all that raises, of course, the question: What can we learn
p272
aVfrom those countries in the green quadrant
p273
aVwho have achieved high levels of equity,
p274
aVhigh levels of performance, and raised outcomes?
p275
aVAnd, of course, the question is, can what works in one context
p276
aVprovide a model elsewhere?
p277
aVOf course, you can't copy and paste education systems wholesale,
p278
aVbut these comparisons have identified a range of factors
p279
aVthat high-performing systems share.
p280
aVEverybody agrees that education is important.
p281
aVEverybody says that.
p282
aVBut the test of truth is, how do you weigh that priority
p283
aVagainst other priorities?
p284
aVHow do countries pay their teachers
p285
aVrelative to other highly skilled workers?
p286
aVWould you want your child to become a teacher
p287
aVrather than a lawyer?
p288
aVHow do the media talk about schools and teachers?
p289
aVThose are the critical questions, and what we have learned
p290
aVfrom PISA is that, in high-performing education systems,
p291
aVthe leaders have convinced their citizens to make choices
p292
aVthat value education, their future,
p293
aVmore than consumption today.
p294
aVAnd you know what's interesting? You won't believe it,
p295
aVbut there are countries in which the most attractive place
p296
aVto be is not the shopping center but the school.
p297
aVThose things really exist.
p298
aa(lp299
VBut placing a high value on education
p300
aVis just part of the picture.
p301
aVThe other part is the belief that all children
p302
aVare capable of success.
p303
aVYou have some countries where students
p304
aVare segregated early in their ages.
p305
aVYou know, students are divided up,
p306
aVreflecting the belief that only some children
p307
aVcan achieve world-class standards.
p308
aVBut usually that is linked to very strong social disparities.
p309
aVIf you go to Japan in Asia, or Finland in Europe,
p310
aVparents and teachers in those countries
p311
aVexpect every student to succeed,
p312
aVand you can see that actually mirrored in student behavior.
p313
aVWhen we asked students what counts
p314
aVfor success in mathematics,
p315
aVstudents in North America would typically tell us,
p316
aVyou know, it's all about talent.
p317
aVIf I'm not born as a genius in math, I'd better study something else.
p318
aVNine out of 10 Japanese students say
p319
aVthat it depends on my own investment, on my own effort,
p320
aVand that tells you a lot about the system that is around them.
p321
aa(lp322
VIn the past, different students were taught in similar ways.
p323
aVHigh performers on PISA embrace diversity
p324
aVwith differentiated pedagogical practices.
p325
aVThey realize that
p326
aVordinary students have extraordinary talents,
p327
aVand they personalize learning opportunities.
p328
aa(lp329
VHigh-performing systems also share
p330
aVclear and ambitious standards across the entire spectrum.
p331
aVEvery student knows what matters.
p332
aVEvery student knows what's required to be successful.
p333
aa(lp334
VAnd nowhere does the quality of an education system
p335
aVexceed the quality of its teachers.
p336
aVHigh-performing systems are very careful
p337
aVin how they recruit and select their teachers
p338
aVand how they train them.
p339
aVThey watch how they improve the performances of teachers
p340
aVin difficulties who are struggling,
p341
aVand how they structure teacher pay.
p342
aVThey provide an environment also in which teachers work together
p343
aVto frame good practice.
p344
aVAnd they provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow
p345
aVin their careers.
p346
aVIn bureaucratic school systems,
p347
aVteachers are often left alone in classrooms
p348
aVwith a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching.
p349
aVHigh-performing systems are very clear what good performance is.
p350
aVThey set very ambitious standards, but then they enable
p351
aVtheir teachers to figure out,
p352
aVwhat do I need to teach to my students today?
p353
aVThe past was about delivered wisdom in education.
p354
aVNow the challenge is to enable user-generated wisdom.
p355
aVHigh performers have moved on from professional
p356
aVor from administrative forms of accountability and control \u2014
p357
aVsort of, how do you check whether people do what they're supposed to do in education \u2014
p358
aVto professional forms of work organization.
p359
aVThey enable their teachers to make innovations in pedagogy.
p360
aVThey provide them with the kind of development they need
p361
aVto develop stronger pedagogical practices.
p362
aVThe goal of the past was standardization and compliance.
p363
aVHigh-performing systems have made teachers
p364
aVand school principals inventive.
p365
aVIn the past, the policy focus was on outcomes,
p366
aVon provision.
p367
aVThe high-performing systems have helped teachers
p368
aVand school principals to look outwards to the next teacher,
p369
aVthe next school around their lives.
p370
aa(lp371
VAnd the most impressive outcomes of world-class systems
p372
aVis that they achieve high performance across the entire system.
p373
aVYou've seen Finland doing so well on PISA,
p374
aVbut what makes Finland so impressive
p375
aVis that only five percent of the performance variation
p376
aVamongst students lies between schools.
p377
aVEvery school succeeds.
p378
aVThis is where success is systemic.
p379
aVAnd how do they do that?
p380
aVThey invest resources where they can make the most difference.
p381
aVThey attract the strongest principals into the toughest schools,
p382
aVand the most talented teachers
p383
aVinto the most challenging classroom.
p384
aa(lp385
VLast but not least, those countries align policies
p386
aVacross all areas of public policy.
p387
aVThey make them coherent over sustained periods of time,
p388
aVand they ensure that what they do is consistently implemented.
p389
aa(lp390
VNow, knowing what successful systems are doing
p391
aVdoesn't yet tell us how to improve.
p392
aVThat's also clear, and that's where some of the limits
p393
aVof international comparisons of PISA are.
p394
aVThat's where other forms of research need to kick in,
p395
aVand that's also why PISA doesn't venture into
p396
aVtelling countries what they should be doing.
p397
aVBut its strength lies in telling them
p398
aVwhat everybody else has been doing.
p399
aVAnd the example of PISA shows that data
p400
aVcan be more powerful than administrative control of financial subsidy
p401
aVthrough which we usually run education systems.
p402
aa(lp403
VYou know, some people argue that
p404
aVchanging educational administration
p405
aVis like moving graveyards.
p406
aVYou just can't rely on the people out there to help you with this. (Laughter)
p407
aVBut PISA has shown what's possible in education.
p408
aVIt has helped countries to see that improvement is possible.
p409
aVIt has taken away excuses from those who are complacent.
p410
aVAnd it has helped countries to set meaningful targets
p411
aVin terms of measurable goals achieved by the world's leaders.
p412
aVIf we can help every child, every teacher, every school,
p413
aVevery principal, every parent see what improvement is possible,
p414
aVthat only the sky is the limit to education improvement,
p415
aVwe have laid the foundations
p416
aVfor better policies and better lives.
p417

VI'm just going to play a brief video clip.
p5
aa(lp6
VVideo:
p7
aVOn the fifth of December 1985, a bottle of 1787 Lafitte was sold
p8
aVfor 105,000 pounds \u2014 nine times the previous world record.
p9
aVThe buyer
p10
aVwas Kip Forbes,
p11
aVson of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the 20th century.
p12
aVThe original owner of the bottle turned out to be
p13
aVone of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the 18th century.
p14
aVChâteau Lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world,
p15
aVthe prince of any wine cellar.
p16
aa(lp17
VBenjamin Wallace: Now, that's about all the videotape that remains of an event
p18
aVthat set off the longest-running mystery in the modern wine world.
p19
aVAnd the mystery existed because of a gentleman named Hardy Rodenstock.
p20
aVIn 1985, he announced to his friends in the wine world
p21
aVthat he had made this incredible discovery.
p22
aVSome workmen in Paris had broken through a brick wall,
p23
aVand happened upon this hidden cache of wines \u2014
p24
aVapparently the property of Thomas Jefferson. 1787, 1784.
p25
aVHe wouldn't reveal the exact number of bottles,
p26
aVhe would not reveal exactly where the building was
p27
aVand he would not reveal exactly who owned the building.
p28
aVThe mystery persisted for about 20 years.
p29
aa(lp30
VIt finally began to get resolved in 2005 because of this guy.
p31
aVBill Koch is a Florida billionaire who owns four of the Jefferson bottles,
p32
aVand he became suspicious.
p33
aVAnd he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-FBI
p34
aVand ex-Scotland Yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this.
p35
aVThere's now ample evidence that Hardy Rodenstock is a con man,
p36
aVand that the Jefferson bottles were fakes.
p37
aa(lp38
VBut for those 20 years,
p39
aVan unbelievable number of really eminent and accomplished figures
p40
aVin the wine world were sort of drawn into the orbit of these bottles.
p41
aVI think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine
p42
aVin the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world,
p43
aVmust be the rarest bottle of wine in the world.
p44
aVI became increasingly, kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of
p45
aVyou know, why do people spend these crazy amounts of money,
p46
aVnot only on wine but on lots of things,
p47
aVand are they living a better life than me?
p48
aa(lp49
VSo, I decided to embark on a quest.
p50
aVWith the generous backing of a magazine I write for sometimes,
p51
aVI decided to sample the very best, or most expensive, or most coveted item
p52
aVin about a dozen categories,
p53
aVwhich was a very grueling quest,  as you can imagine.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VThis was the first one.
p58
aVA lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U.S. is not the real thing.
p59
aVIt may come from Wagyu cattle,
p60
aVbut it's not from the original, Appalachian Hyogo Prefecture in Japan.
p61
aVThere are very few places in the U.S. where you can try real Kobe,
p62
aVand one of them is Wolfgang Puck's restaurant, Cut, in Los Angeles.
p63
aVI went there, and I ordered the eight-ounce rib eye for 160 dollars.
p64
aVAnd it arrived, and it was tiny.
p65
aVAnd I was outraged.
p66
aVIt was like, 160 dollars for this?
p67
aVAnd then I took a bite,
p68
aVand I wished that it was tinier, because Kobe beef is so rich.
p69
aVIt's like foie gras \u2014 it's not even like steak.
p70
aVI almost couldn't finish it.
p71
aVI was really happy when I was done.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VNow, the photographer who took the pictures for this project
p76
aVfor some reason posed his dog in a lot of them,
p77
aVso that's why you're going to see this recurring character.
p78
aVWhich, I guess, you know, communicates to you
p79
aVthat I did not think that one was really worth the price.
p80
aa(lp81
VWhite truffles.
p82
aVOne of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world.
p83
aVTo try this, I went to a Mario Batali restaurant
p84
aVin Manhattan \u2014 Del Posto.
p85
aVThe waiter, you know, came out with the white truffle knob
p86
aVand his shaver, and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said, you know,
p87
aV"Would Signore like the truffles?"
p88
aVAnd the charm of white truffles is in their aroma.
p89
aVIt's not in their taste, really. It's not in their texture.
p90
aVIt's in the smell.
p91
aVThese white pearlescent flakes hit the noodles,
p92
aVthis haunting, wonderful, nutty, mushroomy smell wafted up.
p93
aV10 seconds passed and it was gone.
p94
aVAnd then I was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that,
p95
aVyou know, their purpose had been served,
p96
aVand so I'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me.
p97
aVThere were several \u2014 several of these items were disappointments.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
VYeah.
p102
aVThe magazine wouldn't pay for me to go there.
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VThey did give me a tour, though.
p107
aVAnd this hotel suite is 4,300 square feet.
p108
aVIt has 360-degree views.
p109
aVIt has four balconies.
p110
aVIt was designed by the architect I.M. Pei.
p111
aVIt comes with its own Rolls Royce and driver.
p112
aVIt comes with its own wine cellar that you can draw freely from.
p113
aVWhen I took the tour, it actually included some Opus One, I was glad to see.
p114
aV30,000 dollars for a night in a hotel.
p115
aa(lp116
VThis is soap that's made from silver nanoparticles,
p117
aVwhich have antibacterial properties.
p118
aVI washed my face with this this morning in preparation for this.
p119
aVAnd it, you know, tickled a little bit and it smelled good,
p120
aVbut I have to say that nobody here
p121
aVhas complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
VBut then again, nobody has complimented me on the jeans I'm wearing.
p126
aVThese ones GQ did spring for \u2014 I own these \u2014 but I will tell you,
p127
aVnot only did I not get a compliment from any of you,
p128
aVI have not gotten a compliment from anybody
p129
aVin the months that I have owned and worn these.
p130
aVI don't think that whether or not you're getting a compliment
p131
aVshould be the test of something's value,
p132
aVbut I think in the case of a fashion item, an article of clothing,
p133
aVthat's a reasonable benchmark.
p134
aVThat said, a lot of work goes into these.
p135
aVThey are made from handpicked organic Zimbabwean cotton
p136
aVthat has been shuttle loomed
p137
aVand then hand-dipped in natural indigo 24 times.
p138
aVBut no compliments.
p139
aa(lp140
V(Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
VThank you.
p143
aa(lp144
VArmando Manni is a former filmmaker who makes this olive oil
p145
aVfrom an olive that grows on a single slope in Tuscany.
p146
aVAnd he goes to great lengths to protect the olive oil from oxygen and light.
p147
aVHe uses tiny bottles, the glass is tinted,
p148
aVhe tops the olive oil off with an inert gas.
p149
aVAnd he actually \u2014 once he releases a batch of it,
p150
aVhe regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online,
p151
aVso you can go online and look at your batch number
p152
aVand see how the phenolics are developing,
p153
aVand, you know, gauge its freshness.
p154
aVI did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils.
p155
aVIt tasted fine. It tasted interesting.
p156
aVIt was very green, it was very peppery.
p157
aVBut in the blind taste test, it came in last.
p158
aVThe olive oil that came in first was actually a bottle of
p159
aVWhole Foods 365 olive oil which had been oxidizing next to my stove
p160
aVfor six months.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
VA recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from Japan \u2014
p165
aVyou'll start to notice.
p166
aa(lp167
VI don't play golf, so I couldn't actually road test these,
p168
aVbut I did interview a guy who owns them.
p169
aVEven the people who market these clubs \u2014 I mean, they'll say
p170
aVthese have four axis shafts which minimize loss of club speed
p171
aVand thereby drive the ball farther \u2014 but they'll say, look, you know,
p172
aVyou're not getting 57,000 dollars worth of performance from these clubs.
p173
aVYou're paying for the bling,
p174
aVthat they're encrusted with gold and platinum.
p175
aVThe guy who I interviewed who owns them did say
p176
aVthat he's gotten a lot of pleasure out of them, so ...
p177
aa(lp178
VOh, yeah, you know this one?
p179
aVThis is a coffee made from a very unusual process.
p180
aVThe luwak is an Asian Palm Civet.
p181
aVIt's a cat that lives in trees,
p182
aVand at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations.
p183
aVAnd apparently it's a very picky eater and it, you know,
p184
aVhones in on only the ripest coffee cherries.
p185
aVAnd then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans,
p186
aVand people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings
p187
aVthen go through the forest collecting the, you know, results
p188
aVand processing it into coffee \u2014 although you actually can buy it
p189
aVin the unprocessed form.
p190
aVThat's right.
p191
aa(lp192
VUnrelatedly \u2014
p193
aa(lp194
V(Laughter)
p195
aa(lp196
VJapan is doing crazy things with toilets.
p197
aa(lp198
V(Laughter)
p199
aa(lp200
VThere is now a toilet that has an MP3 player in it.
p201
aVThere's one with a fragrance dispenser.
p202
aVThere's one that actually analyzes the contents of the bowl
p203
aVand transmits the results via email to your doctor.
p204
aVIt's almost like a home medical center \u2014
p205
aVand that is the direction that Japanese toilet technology is heading in.
p206
aVThis one does not have those bells and whistles,
p207
aVbut for pure functionality it's pretty much the best \u2014 the Neorest 600.
p208
aVAnd to try this \u2014 I couldn't get a loaner,
p209
aVbut I did go into the Manhattan showroom of the manufacturer, Toto,
p210
aVand they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use, which I used.
p211
aVIt's fully automated \u2014 you walk towards it, and the seat lifts.
p212
aVThe seat is preheated.
p213
aVThere's a water jet that cleans you.
p214
aVThere's an air jet that dries you.
p215
aVYou get up, it flushes by itself.
p216
aVThe lid closes, it self-cleans.
p217
aVNot only is it a technological leap forward,
p218
aVbut I really do believe it's a bit of a cultural leap forward.
p219
aVI mean, a no hands, no toilet paper toilet.
p220
aVAnd I want to get one of these.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VThis was another one I could not get a loaner of.
p225
aVTom Cruise supposedly owns this bed.
p226
aVThere's a little plaque on the end that, you know,
p227
aVeach buyer gets their name engraved on it.
p228
aa(lp229
V(Laughter)
p230
aa(lp231
VTo try this one, the maker of it let me and my wife
p232
aVspend the night in the Manhattan showroom.
p233
aVLights glaring in off the street,
p234
aVand we had to hire a security guard and all these things.
p235
aVBut anyway, we had a great night's sleep.
p236
aVAnd you spend a third of your life in bed.
p237
aVI don't think it's that bad of a deal.
p238
aa(lp239
V(Laughter)
p240
aa(lp241
VThis was a fun one.
p242
aVThis is the fastest street-legal car in the world
p243
aVand the most expensive production car.
p244
aVI got to drive this with a chaperone from the company,
p245
aVa professional race car driver,
p246
aVand we drove around the canyons outside of Los Angeles
p247
aVand down on the Pacific Coast Highway.
p248
aVAnd, you know, when we pulled up to a stoplight
p249
aVthe people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods.
p250
aVAnd it was really amazing.
p251
aVIt was such a smooth ride.
p252
aVMost of the cars that I drive, if I get up to 80 they start to rattle.
p253
aVI switched lanes on the highway and the driver, this chaperone, said,
p254
aV"You know, you were just going 110 miles an hour."
p255
aVAnd I had no idea that I was one of those obnoxious people
p256
aVyou occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic,
p257
aVbecause it was just that smooth.
p258
aVAnd if I was a billionaire, I would get one.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Laughter)
p261
aa(lp262
VThis is a completely gratuitous video I'm just going to show
p263
aVof one of the pitfalls of advanced technology.
p264
aVThis is Tom Cruise arriving at the "Mission: Impossible III" premiere.
p265
aVWhen he tries to open the door,
p266
aVyou could call it "Mission: Impossible IV."
p267
aa(lp268
VThere was one object that I could not get my hands on,
p269
aVand that was the 1947 Cheval Blanc.
p270
aVThe '47 Cheval Blanc is probably the most mythologized wine of the 20th century.
p271
aVAnd Cheval Blanc is kind of an unusual wine for Bordeaux
p272
aVin having a significant percentage of the Cabernet Franc grape.
p273
aVAnd 1947 was a legendary vintage,
p274
aVespecially in the right bank of Bordeaux.
p275
aVAnd just together, that vintage and that chateau took on this aura
p276
aVthat eventually kind of gave it this cultish following.
p277
aVBut it's 60 years old.
p278
aVThere's not much of it left.
p279
aVWhat there is of it left you don't know if it's real \u2014
p280
aVit's considered to be the most faked wine in the world.
p281
aVNot that many people are looking to pop open
p282
aVtheir one remaining bottle for a journalist.
p283
aa(lp284
VSo, I'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these.
p285
aVI'd put out feelers to retailers, to auctioneers,
p286
aVand it was coming up empty.
p287
aVAnd then I got an email from a guy named Bipin Desai.
p288
aVBipin Desai is a U.C. Riverside theoretical physicist
p289
aVwho also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings,
p290
aVand he said, "I've got a tasting coming up
p291
aVwhere we're going to serve the '47 Cheval Blanc."
p292
aVAnd it was going to be a double vertical \u2014
p293
aVit was going to be 30 vintages of Cheval Blanc,
p294
aVand 30 vintages of Yquem.
p295
aVAnd it was an invitation you do not refuse.
p296
aVI went.
p297
aa(lp298
VIt was three days, four meals.
p299
aVAnd at lunch on Saturday, we opened the '47.
p300
aVAnd you know, it had this fragrant softness,
p301
aVand it smelled a little bit of linseed oil.
p302
aVAnd then I tasted it, and it,
p303
aVyou know, had this kind of unctuous, porty richness,
p304
aVwhich is characteristic of that wine \u2014
p305
aVthat it sort of resembles port in a lot of ways.
p306
aVThere were people at my table who thought it was, you know, fantastic.
p307
aVThere were some people who were a little less impressed.
p308
aVAnd I wasn't that impressed.
p309
aVAnd I don't \u2014 call my palate a philistine palate \u2014
p310
aVso it doesn't necessarily mean something that I wasn't impressed,
p311
aVbut I was not the only one there who had that reaction.
p312
aVAnd it wasn't just to that wine.
p313
aVAny one of the wines served at this tasting,
p314
aVif I'd been served it at a dinner party, it would have been, you know,
p315
aVthe wine experience of my lifetime, and incredibly memorable.
p316
aVBut drinking 60 great wines over three days,
p317
aVthey all just blurred together,
p318
aVand it became almost a grueling experience.
p319
aa(lp320
VAnd I just wanted to finish by mentioning a very interesting study
p321
aVwhich came out earlier this year from some researchers at Stanford and Caltech.
p322
aVAnd they gave subjects the same wine,
p323
aVlabeled with different price tags.
p324
aVA lot of people, you know,
p325
aVsaid that they liked the more expensive wine more \u2014
p326
aVit was the same wine, but they thought it was a different one
p327
aVthat was more expensive.
p328
aVBut what was unexpected was that these researchers did
p329
aVMRI brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine,
p330
aVand not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more \u2014
p331
aVtheir brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasure
p332
aVfrom the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag.
p333
aa(lp334
VThank you.

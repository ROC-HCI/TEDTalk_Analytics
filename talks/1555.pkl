VIn System D, this
p5
aVis a store,
p6
aVand what I mean by that is that this is a photograph
p7
aVI took in Makoko, shantytown in Lagos, Nigeria.
p8
aVIt's built over the lagoon, and there are no streets
p9
aVwhere there can be stores to shop,
p10
aVand so the store comes to you.
p11
aa(lp12
VAnd in the same community,
p13
aVthis is business synergy.
p14
aVThis is the boat that that lady was paddling around in,
p15
aVand this artisan makes the boat and the paddles
p16
aVand sells directly
p17
aVto the people who need the boat and the paddles.
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd this is a global business.
p20
aVOgandiro smokes fish in Makoko in Lagos,
p21
aVand I asked her, "Where does the fish come from?"
p22
aVAnd I thought she'd say, "Oh, you know,
p23
aVup the lagoon somewhere, or maybe across Africa,"
p24
aVbut you'll be happy to know she said
p25
aVit came from here, it comes from the North Sea.
p26
aVIt's caught here, frozen, shipped down to Lagos,
p27
aVsmoked, and sold for a tiny increment of profit
p28
aVon the streets of Lagos.
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd this is a business incubator.
p31
aVThis is Olusosun dump, the largest garbage dump in Lagos,
p32
aVand 2,000 people work here, and I found this out
p33
aVfrom this fellow, Andrew Saboru.
p34
aVAndrew spent 16 years scavenging materials on the dump,
p35
aVearned enough money to turn himself into a contract scaler,
p36
aVwhich meant he carried a scale and went around and
p37
aVweighed all the materials that people had scavenged
p38
aVfrom the dump. Now he's a scrap dealer.
p39
aVThat's his little depot behind him,
p40
aVand he earns twice the Nigerian minimum wage.
p41
aa(lp42
VThis is a shopping mall.
p43
aVThis is Oshodi Market in Lagos.
p44
aVJorge Luis Borges had a story called "The Aleph,"
p45
aVand the Aleph is a point in the world
p46
aVwhere absolutely everything exists,
p47
aVand for me, this image is a point in the world
p48
aVwhere absolutely everything exists.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo, what am I talking about when I talk about System D?
p51
aVIt's traditionally called the informal economy,
p52
aVthe underground economy, the black market.
p53
aVI don't conceive of it that way.
p54
aVI think it's really important to understand that something like
p55
aVthis is totally open. It's right there for you to find.
p56
aVAll of this is happening openly, and aboveboard.
p57
aVThere's nothing underground about it.
p58
aVIt's our prejudgment that it's underground.
p59
aa(lp60
VI've pirated the term System D from the former French colonies.
p61
aVThere's a word in French that is débrouillardise,
p62
aVthat means to be self-reliant,
p63
aVand the former French colonies have turned that into
p64
aVSystem D for the economy of self-reliance,
p65
aVor the DIY economy.
p66
aa(lp67
VBut governments hate the DIY economy,
p68
aVand that's why \u2014 I took this picture in 2007,
p69
aVand this is the same market in 2009 \u2014
p70
aVand I think, when the organizers of this conference
p71
aVwere talking about radical openness,
p72
aVthey didn't mean that the streets should be open
p73
aVand the people should be gone.
p74
aa(lp75
VI think what we have is a pickle problem.
p76
aVI had a friend who worked at a pickle factory,
p77
aVand the cucumbers would come flying down
p78
aVthis conveyer belt, and his job was to pick off the ones
p79
aVthat didn't look so good and throw them in the bin
p80
aVlabeled "relish" where they'd be crushed and mixed
p81
aVwith vinegar and used for other kinds of profit.
p82
aVThis is the pickle economy.
p83
aVWe're all focusing on \u2014 this is a statistic from
p84
aVearlier this month in the Financial Times \u2014
p85
aVwe're all focusing on the luxury economy.
p86
aVIt's worth 1.5 trillion dollars every year, and that's
p87
aVa vast amount of money, right?
p88
aVThat's three times the Gross Domestic Product of Switzerland.
p89
aVSo it's vast. But it should come with an asterisk,
p90
aVand the asterisk is that it excludes two thirds of the workers
p91
aVof the world.
p92
aV1.8 billion people around the world work
p93
aVin the economy that is unregulated and informal.
p94
aVThat's a huge number, and what does that mean?
p95
aVWell, it means if it were united in a single political system,
p96
aVone country, call it
p97
aV"The United Street Sellers Republic," the U.S.S.R.,
p98
aVor "Bazaaristan,"
p99
aVit would be worth 10 trillion dollars every year,
p100
aVand that would make it the second largest economy
p101
aVin the world, after the United States.
p102
aVAnd given that projections are that the bulk
p103
aVof economic growth over the next 15 years will come
p104
aVfrom emerging economies in the developing world,
p105
aVit could easily overtake the United States
p106
aVand become the largest economy in the world.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo the implications of that are vast, because it means
p109
aVthat this is where employment is \u2014 1.8 billion people \u2014
p110
aVand this is where we can create a more egalitarian world,
p111
aVbecause people are actually able to earn money and live
p112
aVand thrive, as Andrew Saboru did.
p113
aa(lp114
VBig businesses have recognized this,
p115
aVand what's fascinating about this slide,
p116
aVit's not that the guys can carry boxes on their heads
p117
aVand run around without dropping them off.
p118
aVit's that the Gala sausage roll is a product that's made
p119
aVby a global company called UAC foods
p120
aVthat's active throughout Africa and the Middle East,
p121
aVbut the Gala sausage roll is not sold in stores.
p122
aVUAC foods has recognized that it won't sell if it's in stores.
p123
aVIt's only sold by a phalanx of street hawkers
p124
aVwho run around the streets of Lagos at bus stations
p125
aVand in traffic jams and sell it as a snack,
p126
aVand it's been sold that way for 40 years.
p127
aVIt's a business plan for a corporation.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd it's not just in Africa.
p130
aVHere's Mr. Clean looking amorously at all the other
p131
aVProcter & Gamble products,
p132
aVand Procter & Gamble, you know,
p133
aVthe statistic always cited is that Wal-Mart
p134
aVis their largest customer, and it's true, as one store,
p135
aVWal-Mart buys 15 percent, thus 15 percent
p136
aVof Procter & Gamble's business is with Wal-Mart,
p137
aVbut their largest market segment is something that they call
p138
aV"high frequency stores," which is all these tiny kiosks
p139
aVand the lady in the canoe and all these other businesses
p140
aVthat exist in System D, the informal economy,
p141
aVand Procter & Gamble makes 20 percent of its money
p142
aVfrom that market segment,
p143
aVand it's the only market segment that's growing.
p144
aVSo Procter & Gamble says, "We don't care whether a store
p145
aVis incorporated or registered or anything like that.
p146
aVWe want our products in that store."
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd then there's mobile phones.
p149
aVThis is an ad for MTN,
p150
aVwhich is a South African multinational
p151
aVactive in about 25 countries,
p152
aVand when they came into Nigeria \u2014
p153
aVNigeria is the big dog in Africa.
p154
aVOne in seven Africans is a Nigerian,
p155
aVand so everyone wants in to the mobile phone market
p156
aVin Nigeria. And when MTN came in, they wanted
p157
aVto sell the mobile service like I get in the United States
p158
aVor like people get here in the U.K. or in Europe \u2014
p159
aVexpensive monthly plans, you get a phone,
p160
aVyou pay overages,
p161
aVyou're killed with fees \u2014
p162
aVand their plan crashed and burned.
p163
aVAnd they went back to the drawing board, and they retooled,
p164
aVand they came up with another plan:
p165
aVWe don't sell you the phone,
p166
aVwe don't sell you the monthly plan.
p167
aVWe only sell you airtime.
p168
aVAnd where's the airtime sold?
p169
aVIt's sold at umbrella stands all over the streets,
p170
aVwhere people are unregistered, unlicensed,
p171
aVbut MTN makes most of its profits,
p172
aVperhaps 90 percent of its profits,
p173
aVfrom selling through System D, the informal economy.
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd where do the phones come from?
p176
aVWell, they come from here. This is in Guangzhou, China,
p177
aVand if you go upstairs in this rather sleepy looking
p178
aVelectronics mall, you find the Guangzhou Dashatou
p179
aVsecond-hand trade center,
p180
aVand if you go in there, you follow the guys with the muscles
p181
aVwho are carrying the boxes, and where are they going?
p182
aVThey're going to Eddy in Lagos.
p183
aVNow, most of the phones there are not second-hand at all.
p184
aVThe name is a misnomer.
p185
aVMost of them are pirated. They have the name brand
p186
aVon them, but they're not manufactured by the name brand.
p187
aa(lp188
VNow, are there downsides to that?
p189
aVWell, I guess. You know, China has no \u2014
p190
aV(Laughter) \u2014 no intellectual property, right?
p191
aVVersace without the vowels.
p192
aVZhuomani instead of Armani.
p193
aVS. Guuuci, and \u2014 (Laughter) (Applause)
p194
aVAll around the world this is how products
p195
aVare being distributed, so, for instance,
p196
aVin one street market on Rua 25 de Março
p197
aVin São Paulo, Brazil,
p198
aVyou can buy fake designer glasses.
p199
aVYou can buy cloned cologne.
p200
aVYou can buy pirated DVDs, of course.
p201
aVYou can buy New York Yankees caps
p202
aVin all sorts of unauthorized patterns.
p203
aVYou can buy cuecas baratas, designer underwear
p204
aVthat isn't really manufactured by a designer,
p205
aVand even pirated evangelical mixtapes. (Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VNow, businesses tend to complain about this,
p208
aVand their, they, I don't want to take away from their
p209
aVentire validity of complaining about it,
p210
aVbut I did ask a major sneaker manufacturer earlier this year
p211
aVwhat they thought about piracy,
p212
aVand they told me, "Well, you can't quote me on this,
p213
aVbecause if you quote me on this, I have to kill you,"
p214
aVbut they use piracy as market research.
p215
aVThe sneaker manufacturer told me that if
p216
aVthey find that Pumas are being pirated, or Adidas
p217
aVare being pirated and their sneakers aren't being pirated,
p218
aVthey know they've done something wrong. (Laughter)
p219
aVSo it's very important to them to track piracy
p220
aVexactly because of this, and the people who are buying,
p221
aVthe pirates, are not their customers anyway,
p222
aVbecause their customers want the real deal.
p223
aa(lp224
VNow, there's another problem.
p225
aVThis is a real street sign in Lagos, Nigeria.
p226
aVAll of System D really doesn't pay taxes, right?
p227
aVAnd when I think about that, first of all I think that
p228
aVgovernment is a social contract between the people and
p229
aVthe government, and if the government isn't transparent,
p230
aVthen the people aren't going to be transparent either,
p231
aVbut also that we're blaming the little guy
p232
aVwho doesn't pay his taxes, and we're not recognizing
p233
aVthat everyone's fudging things all over the world,
p234
aVincluding some extremely respected businesses,
p235
aVand I'll give you one example.
p236
aVThere was one company that paid 4,000 bribes
p237
aVin the first decade of this millennium, and
p238
aVa million dollars in bribes every business day, right?
p239
aVAll over the world. And that company
p240
aVwas the big German electronics giant Siemens.
p241
aVSo this goes on in the formal economy
p242
aVas well as the informal economy,
p243
aVso it's wrong of us to blame \u2014 and I'm not singling out
p244
aVSiemens, I'm saying everyone does it. Okay?
p245
aa(lp246
VI just want to end by saying that if Adam Smith
p247
aVhad framed out a theory of the flea market
p248
aVinstead of the free market, what would be some
p249
aVof the principles?
p250
aa(lp251
VFirst, it would be to understand that it could be
p252
aVconsidered a cooperative, and this is a thought
p253
aVfrom the Brazilian legal scholar Roberto Mangabeira Unger.
p254
aVCooperative development is a way forward.
p255
aa(lp256
VSecondly, from the [Austrian] anarchist philosopher Paul Feyerabend,
p257
aVfacts are relative, and what is a massive right
p258
aVof self-reliance to a Nigerian businessperson
p259
aVis considered unauthorized and horrible to other people,
p260
aVand we have to recognize that there are differences
p261
aVin how people define things and what their facts are.
p262
aa(lp263
VAnd third is, and I'm taking this from
p264
aVthe great American beat poet Allen Ginsberg,
p265
aVthat alternate economies barter and
p266
aVdifferent kinds of currency, alternate currencies
p267
aVare also very important, and he talked about
p268
aVbuying what he needed just with his good looks.
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd so I just want to leave you there, and say that
p271
aVthis economy is a tremendous force for global development
p272
aVand we need to think about it that way.
p273
aVThank you very much. (Applause)
p274
aV(Applause)

VHow do groups get anything done? Right?
p5
aVHow do you organize a group of individuals
p6
aVso that the output of the group
p7
aVis something coherent and of lasting value,
p8
aVinstead of just being chaos?
p9
aVAnd the economic framing of that problem
p10
aVis called coordination costs.
p11
aVAnd a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial
p12
aVor institutional difficulties in arranging group output.
p13
aVAnd we've had a classic answer for coordination costs,
p14
aVwhich is, if you want to coordinate the work of a group of people,
p15
aVyou start an institution, right? You raise some resources.
p16
aVYou found something. It can be private or public.
p17
aVIt can be for profit or not profit. It can be large or small.
p18
aVBut you get these resources together.
p19
aVYou found an institution, and you use the institution
p20
aVto coordinate the activities of the group.
p21
aa(lp22
VMore recently, because the cost of letting groups
p23
aVcommunicate with each other has fallen through the floor \u2014
p24
aVand communication costs are one of the big
p25
aVinputs to coordination \u2014 there has been a second answer,
p26
aVwhich is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure,
p27
aVto design systems that coordinate the output
p28
aVof the group as a by-product of the operating of the system,
p29
aVwithout regard to institutional models.
p30
aVSo, that's what I want to talk about today.
p31
aVI'm going to illustrate it with some fairly concrete examples,
p32
aVbut always pointing to the broader themes.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo, I'm going to start by trying to answer a question
p35
aVthat I know each of you will have asked yourself at some point or other,
p36
aVand which the Internet is purpose-built to answer,
p37
aVwhich is, where can I get a picture of a roller-skating mermaid?
p38
aVSo, in New York City, on the first Saturday of every summer,
p39
aVConey Island, our local, charmingly run-down amusement park,
p40
aVhosts the Mermaid Parade. It's an amateur parade;
p41
aVpeople come from all over the city; people get all dressed up.
p42
aVSome people get less dressed up.
p43
aVYoung and old, dancing in the streets.
p44
aVColorful characters, and a good time is had by all.
p45
aVAnd what I want to call your attention to is not the Mermaid Parade itself,
p46
aVcharming though it is, but rather to these photos.
p47
aVI didn't take them. How did I get them?
p48
aVAnd the answer is: I got them from Flickr.
p49
aa(lp50
VFlickr is a photo-sharing service
p51
aVthat allows people to take photos, upload them,
p52
aVshare them over the Web and so forth.
p53
aVRecently, Flickr has added an additional function called tagging.
p54
aVTagging was pioneered by Delicious and Joshua Schachter.
p55
aVDelicious is a social bookmarking service.
p56
aVTagging is a cooperative infrastructure answer to classification.
p57
aVRight? If I had given this talk last year,
p58
aVI couldn't do what I just did,
p59
aVbecause I couldn't have found those photos.
p60
aVBut instead of saying,
p61
aVwe need to hire a professional class of librarians
p62
aVto organize these photos once they're uploaded,
p63
aVFlickr simply turned over to the users
p64
aVthe ability to characterize the photos.
p65
aVSo, I was able to go in and draw down photos that had been tagged
p66
aV"Mermaid Parade." There were 3,100 photos taken by 118 photographers,
p67
aVall aggregated and then put under this nice, neat name,
p68
aVshown in reverse chronological order.
p69
aVAnd I was then able to go and retrieve them
p70
aVto give you that little slideshow.
p71
aa(lp72
VNow, what hard problem is being solved here?
p73
aVAnd it's \u2014 in the most schematic possible view,
p74
aVit's a coordination problem, right?
p75
aVThere are a large number of people on the Internet,
p76
aVa very small fraction of them have photos of the Mermaid Parade.
p77
aVHow do we get those people together to contribute that work?
p78
aVThe classic answer is to form an institution, right?
p79
aVTo draw those people into some prearranged structure
p80
aVthat has explicit goals.
p81
aVAnd I want to call your attention to
p82
aVsome of the side effects of going the institutional route.
p83
aa(lp84
VFirst of all, when you form an institution,
p85
aVyou take on a management problem, right?
p86
aVNo good just hiring employees,
p87
aVyou also have to hire other employees to manage those employees
p88
aVand to enforce the goals of the institution and so forth.
p89
aVSecondly, you have to bring structure into place.
p90
aVRight? You have to have economic structure.
p91
aVYou have to have legal structure.
p92
aVYou have to have physical structure.
p93
aVAnd that creates additional costs.
p94
aVThird, forming an institution is inherently exclusionary.
p95
aVYou notice we haven't got everybody who has a photo.
p96
aVYou can't hire everyone in a company, right?
p97
aVYou can't recruit everyone into a governmental organization.
p98
aVYou have to exclude some people.
p99
aVAnd fourth, as a result of that exclusion,
p100
aVyou end up with a professional class. Look at the change here.
p101
aVWe've gone from people with photos to photographers.
p102
aVRight? We've created a professional class of photographers
p103
aVwhose goal is to go out and photograph the Mermaid Parade,
p104
aVor whatever else they're sent out to photograph.
p105
aa(lp106
VWhen you build cooperation into the infrastructure,
p107
aVwhich is the Flickr answer,
p108
aVyou can leave the people where they are
p109
aVand you take the problem to the individuals, rather than
p110
aVmoving the individuals to the problem.
p111
aVYou arrange the coordination in the group, and by doing that
p112
aVyou get the same outcome, without the institutional difficulties.
p113
aVYou lose the institutional imperative.
p114
aVYou lose the right to shape people's work when it's volunteer effort,
p115
aVbut you also shed the institutional cost,
p116
aVwhich gives you greater flexibility.
p117
aVWhat Flickr does is it replaces planning with coordination.
p118
aVAnd this is a general aspect of these cooperative systems.
p119
aa(lp120
VRight. You'll have experienced this in your life
p121
aVwhenever you bought your first mobile phone,
p122
aVand you stopped making plans.
p123
aVYou just said, "I'll call you when I get there."
p124
aV"Call me when you get off work." Right?
p125
aVThat is a point-to-point replacement of coordination with planning.
p126
aVRight. We're now able to do that kind of thing with groups.
p127
aVTo say instead of, we must make an advance plan,
p128
aVwe must have a five-year projection
p129
aVof where the Wikipedia is going to be, or whatever,
p130
aVyou can just say, let's coordinate the group effort,
p131
aVand let's deal with it as we go,
p132
aVbecause we're now well-enough coordinated
p133
aVthat we don't have to take on the problems of deciding in advance what to do.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo here's another example. This one's somewhat more somber.
p136
aVThese are photos on Flickr tagged "Iraq."
p137
aVAnd everything that was hard about the coordination cost
p138
aVwith the Mermaid Parade is even harder here.
p139
aVThere are more pictures. There are more photographers.
p140
aVIt's taken over a wider geographic area.
p141
aVThe photos are spread out over a longer period of time.
p142
aVAnd worst of all, that figure at the bottom,
p143
aVapproximately ten photos per photographer, is a lie.
p144
aVIt's mathematically true,
p145
aVbut it doesn't really talk about anything important \u2014
p146
aVbecause in these systems, the average isn't really what matters.
p147
aa(lp148
VWhat matters is this.
p149
aVThis is a graph of photographs tagged Iraq
p150
aVas taken by the 529 photographers who contributed the 5,445 photos.
p151
aVAnd it's ranked in order of number of photos taken per photographer.
p152
aVYou can see here, over at the end,
p153
aVour most prolific photographer has taken around 350 photos,
p154
aVand you can see there's a few people who have taken hundreds of photos.
p155
aVThen there's dozens of people who've taken dozens of photos.
p156
aVAnd by the time we get around here,
p157
aVwe get ten or fewer photos, and then there's this long, flat tail.
p158
aVAnd by the time you get to the middle,
p159
aVyou've got hundreds of people
p160
aVwho have contributed only one photo each.
p161
aa(lp162
VThis is called a power-law distribution.
p163
aVIt appears often in unconstrained social systems
p164
aVwhere people are allowed to contribute as much or as little as they like \u2014
p165
aVthis is often what you get. Right?
p166
aVThe math behind the power-law distribution is that whatever's in the nth position
p167
aVis doing about one-nth of whatever's being measured,
p168
aVrelative to the person in the first position.
p169
aVSo, we'd expect the tenth most prolific photographer
p170
aVto have contributed about a tenth of the photos,
p171
aVand the hundredth most prolific photographer
p172
aVto have contributed only about a hundred as many photos
p173
aVas the most prolific photographer did.
p174
aVSo, the head of the curve can be sharper or flatter.
p175
aVBut that basic math accounts both for the steep slope
p176
aVand for the long, flat tail.
p177
aa(lp178
VAnd curiously, in these systems, as they grow larger,
p179
aVthe systems don't converge; they diverge more.
p180
aVIn bigger systems, the head gets bigger
p181
aVand the tail gets longer, so the imbalance increases.
p182
aVYou can see the curve is obviously heavily left-weighted. Here's how heavily:
p183
aVif you take the top 10 percent of photographers contributing to this system,
p184
aVthey account for three quarters of the photos taken \u2014
p185
aVjust the top 10 percent most prolific photographers.
p186
aVIf you go down to five percent,
p187
aVyou're still accounting for 60 percent of the photos.
p188
aVIf you go down to one percent, exclude 99 percent of the group effort,
p189
aVyou're still accounting for almost a quarter of the photos.
p190
aVAnd because of this left weighting,
p191
aVthe average is actually here, way to the left.
p192
aVAnd that sounds strange to our ears,
p193
aVbut what ends up happening is that 80 percent of the contributors
p194
aVhave contributed a below-average amount.
p195
aVThat sounds strange because we expect average and middle
p196
aVto be about the same, but they're not at all.
p197
aa(lp198
VThis is the math underlying the 80/20 rule. Right?
p199
aVWhenever you hear anybody talking about the 80/20 rule,
p200
aVthis is what's going on. Right?
p201
aV20 percent of the merchandise accounts for 80 percent of the revenue,
p202
aV20 percent of the users use 80 percent of the resources \u2014
p203
aVthis is the shape people are talking about when that happens.
p204
aVInstitutions only have two tools: carrots and sticks.
p205
aVAnd the 80 percent zone is a no-carrot and no-stick zone.
p206
aVThe costs of running the institution mean that you cannot
p207
aVtake on the work of those people easily in an institutional frame.
p208
aVThe institutional model always pushes leftwards,
p209
aVtreating these people as employees.
p210
aVThe institutional response is,
p211
aVI can get 75 percent of the value for 10 percent of the hires \u2014 great,
p212
aVthat's what I'll do.
p213
aVThe cooperative infrastructure model says,
p214
aVwhy do you want to give up a quarter of the value?
p215
aVIf your system is designed
p216
aVso that you have to give up a quarter of the value,
p217
aVre-engineer the system.
p218
aVDon't take on the cost that prevents you
p219
aVfrom getting to the contributions of these people.
p220
aVBuild the system so that anybody can contribute at any amount.
p221
aa(lp222
VSo the coordination response asks not,
p223
aVhow are these people as employees, but rather,
p224
aVwhat is their contribution like? Right?
p225
aVWe have over here Psycho Milt, a Flickr user,
p226
aVwho has contributed one, and only one, photo titled "Iraq."
p227
aVAnd here's the photo. Right. Labeled, "Bad Day at Work."
p228
aVRight? So the question is,
p229
aVdo you want that photo? Yes or no.
p230
aVThe question is not, is Psycho Milt a good employee?
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd the tension here is between institution as enabler
p233
aVand institution as obstacle.
p234
aVWhen you're dealing with the left-hand edge
p235
aVof one of these distributions,
p236
aVwhen you're dealing with the people who spend a lot of time
p237
aVproducing a lot of the material you want,
p238
aVthat's an institution-as-enabler world.
p239
aVYou can hire those people as employees, you can coordinate their work
p240
aVand you can get some output.
p241
aVBut when you're down here, where the Psycho Milts of the world
p242
aVare adding one photo at a time,
p243
aVthat's institution as obstacle.
p244
aa(lp245
VInstitutions hate being told they're obstacles.
p246
aVOne of the first things that happens
p247
aVwhen you institutionalize a problem
p248
aVis that the first goal of the institution
p249
aVimmediately shifts from whatever the nominal goal was
p250
aVto self-preservation.
p251
aVAnd the actual goal of the institution goes to two through n.
p252
aVRight? So, when institutions are told they are obstacles,
p253
aVand that there are other ways of coordinating the value,
p254
aVthey go through something a little bit like the Kubler-Ross stages \u2014
p255
aV(Laughter)
p256
aV\u2014 of reaction, being told you have a fatal illness:
p257
aVdenial, anger, bargaining, acceptance.
p258
aVMost of the cooperative systems we've seen
p259
aVhaven't been around long enough
p260
aVto have gotten to the acceptance phase.
p261
aa(lp262
VMany, many institutions are still in denial,
p263
aVbut we're seeing recently a lot of both anger and bargaining.
p264
aVThere's a wonderful, small example going on right now.
p265
aVIn France, a bus company is suing people for forming a carpool,
p266
aVright, because the fact that they have coordinated
p267
aVthemselves to create cooperative value is depriving them of revenue.
p268
aVYou can follow this in the Guardian.
p269
aVIt's actually quite entertaining.
p270
aa(lp271
VThe bigger question is,
p272
aVwhat do you do about the value down here?
p273
aVRight? How do you capture that?
p274
aVAnd institutions, as I've said, are prevented from capturing that.
p275
aVSteve Ballmer, now CEO of Microsoft,
p276
aVwas criticizing Linux a couple of years ago, and he said,
p277
aV"Oh, this business of thousands of programmers
p278
aVcontributing to Linux, this is a myth.
p279
aVWe've looked at who's contributed to Linux,
p280
aVand most of the patches have been produced by programmers
p281
aVwho've only done one thing." Right?
p282
aVYou can hear this distribution under that complaint.
p283
aVAnd you can see why, from Ballmer's point of view,
p284
aVthat's a bad idea, right?
p285
aVWe hired this programmer, he came in, he drank our Cokes
p286
aVand played Foosball for three years and he had one idea.
p287
aV(Laughter)
p288
aVRight? Bad hire. Right?
p289
aV(Laughter)
p290
aa(lp291
VThe Psycho Milt question is, was it a good idea?
p292
aVWhat if it was a security patch?
p293
aVWhat if it was a security patch for a buffer overflow exploit,
p294
aVof which Windows has not some, [but] several?
p295
aVDo you want that patch, right?
p296
aVThe fact that a single programmer can,
p297
aVwithout having to move into a professional relation
p298
aVto an institution, improve Linux once
p299
aVand never be seen from again, should terrify Ballmer.
p300
aVBecause this kind of value is unreachable in classic
p301
aVinstitutional frameworks, but is part of cooperative
p302
aVsystems of open-source software, of file sharing,
p303
aa(lp304
Vof the Wikipedia. I've used a lot of examples from Flickr,
p305
aVbut there are actually stories about this from all over.
p306
aVMeetup, a service founded so that users could find people
p307
aVin their local area who share their interests and affinities
p308
aVand actually have a real-world meeting offline in a cafe
p309
aVor a pub or what have you.
p310
aVWhen Scott Heiferman founded Meetup,
p311
aVhe thought it would be used for, you know,
p312
aVtrain spotters and cat fanciers \u2014 classic affinity groups.
p313
aVThe inventors don't know what the invention is.
p314
aVNumber one group on Meetup right now,
p315
aVmost chapters in most cities with most members, most active?
p316
aVStay-at-home moms. Right?
p317
aVIn the suburbanized, dual-income United States,
p318
aVstay-at-home moms are actually missing
p319
aVthe social infrastructure that comes from extended family
p320
aVand local, small-scale neighborhoods.
p321
aVSo they're reinventing it, using these tools.
p322
aVMeetup is the platform,
p323
aVbut the value here is in social infrastructure.
p324
aVIf you want to know what technology is going to change the world,
p325
aVdon't pay attention to 13-year-old boys \u2014
p326
aVpay attention to young mothers,
p327
aVbecause they have got not an ounce of support for technology
p328
aVthat doesn't materially make their lives better.
p329
aVThis is so much more important than Xbox,
p330
aVbut it's a lot less glitzy.
p331
aa(lp332
VI think this is a revolution.
p333
aVI think that this is a really profound change
p334
aVin the way human affairs are arranged.
p335
aVAnd I use that word advisedly.
p336
aVIt's a revolution in that it's a change in equilibrium.
p337
aVIt's a whole new way of doing things, which includes new downsides.
p338
aVIn the United States right now, a woman named Judith Miller
p339
aVis in jail for not having given to a Federal Grand Jury her sources \u2014
p340
aVshe's a reporter for the New York Times \u2014
p341
aVher sources, in a very abstract and hard-to-follow case.
p342
aVAnd journalists are in the street rallying to improve the shield laws.
p343
aVThe shield laws are our laws \u2014 pretty much a patchwork of state laws \u2014
p344
aVthat prevent a journalist from having to betray a source.
p345
aVThis is happening, however, against the background
p346
aVof the rise of Web logging.
p347
aVWeb logging is a classic example of mass amateurization.
p348
aVIt has de-professionalized publishing.
p349
aVWant to publish globally anything you think today?
p350
aVIt is a one-button operation that you can do for free.
p351
aVThat has sent the professional class of publishing down
p352
aVinto the ranks of mass amateurization.
p353
aVAnd so the shield law, as much as we want it \u2014
p354
aVwe want a professional class of truth-tellers \u2014
p355
aVit is becoming increasingly incoherent, because
p356
aVthe institution is becoming incoherent.
p357
aVThere are people in the States right now
p358
aVtying themselves into knots, trying to figure out
p359
aVwhether or not bloggers are journalists.
p360
aVAnd the answer to that question is,
p361
aVit doesn't matter, because that's not the right question.
p362
aVJournalism was an answer to an even more important question,
p363
aVwhich is, how will society be informed?
p364
aVHow will they share ideas and opinions?
p365
aVAnd if there is an answer to that that happens outside
p366
aVthe professional framework of journalism,
p367
aVit makes no sense to take a professional metaphor
p368
aVand apply it to this distributed class.
p369
aVSo as much as we want the shield laws,
p370
aVthe background \u2014 the institution to which they were attached \u2014
p371
aVis becoming incoherent.
p372
aa(lp373
VHere's another example.
p374
aVPro-ana, the pro-ana groups.
p375
aVThese are groups of teenage girls
p376
aVwho have taken on Web logs, bulletin boards,
p377
aVother kinds of cooperative infrastructure,
p378
aVand have used it to set up support groups for
p379
aVremaining anorexic by choice.
p380
aVThey post pictures of thin models, which they call "thinspiration."
p381
aVThey have little slogans, like "Salvation through Starvation."
p382
aVThey even have Lance Armstrong-style bracelets,
p383
aVthese red bracelets, which signify, in the small group,
p384
aVI am trying to maintain my eating disorder.
p385
aVThey trade tips, like, if you feel like eating something,
p386
aVclean a toilet or the litter box. The feeling will pass.
p387
aa(lp388
VWe're used to support groups being beneficial.
p389
aVWe have an attitude that support groups are inherently beneficial.
p390
aVBut it turns out that the logic of the support group is value neutral.
p391
aVA support group is simply a small group that wants to maintain
p392
aVa way of living in the context of a larger group.
p393
aVNow, when the larger group is a bunch of drunks,
p394
aVand the small group wants to stay sober, then we think,
p395
aVthat's a great support group.
p396
aVBut when the small group is teenage girls
p397
aVwho want to stay anorexic by choice, then we're horrified.
p398
aVWhat's happened is that the normative goals
p399
aVof the support groups that we're used to,
p400
aVcame from the institutions that were framing them,
p401
aVand not from the infrastructure.
p402
aVOnce the infrastructure becomes generically available,
p403
aVthe logic of the support group has been revealed to be
p404
aVaccessible to anyone, including people pursuing these kinds of goals.
p405
aa(lp406
VSo, there are significant downsides to these changes
p407
aVas well as upsides. And of course, in the current environment,
p408
aVone need allude only lightly to the work of non-state actors
p409
aVtrying to influence global affairs, and taking advantage of these.
p410
aVThis is a social map of the hijackers and their associates
p411
aVwho perpetrated the 9/11 attack.
p412
aVIt was produced by analyzing their communications patterns
p413
aVusing a lot of these tools. And doubtless the intelligence communities of the world
p414
aVare doing the same work today for the attacks of last week.
p415
aa(lp416
VNow, this is the part of the talk where I tell you
p417
aVwhat's going to come as a result of all of this,
p418
aVbut I'm running out of time, which is good,
p419
aVbecause I don't know.
p420

p421
aVRight. As with the printing press, if it's really a revolution,
p422
aVit doesn't take us from Point A to Point B.
p423
aVIt takes us from Point A to chaos.
p424
aVThe printing press precipitated 200 years of chaos,
p425
aVmoving from a world where the Catholic Church
p426
aVwas the sort of organizing political force to the Treaty of Westphalia,
p427
aVwhen we finally knew what the new unit was: the nation state.
p428
aa(lp429
VNow, I'm not predicting 200 years of chaos as a result of this. 50.
p430
aV50 years in which loosely coordinated groups
p431
aVare going to be given increasingly high leverage,
p432
aVand the more those groups forego traditional institutional imperatives \u2014
p433
aVlike deciding in advance what's going to happen,
p434
aVor the profit motive \u2014 the more leverage they'll get.
p435
aVAnd institutions are going to come under
p436
aVan increasing degree of pressure,
p437
aVand the more rigidly managed, and the more they rely
p438
aVon information monopolies, the greater the pressure is going to be.
p439
aVAnd that's going to happen one arena at a time,
p440
aVone institution at a time. The forces are general,
p441
aVbut the results are going to be specific.
p442
aa(lp443
VAnd so the point here is not,
p444
aV"This is wonderful," or "We're going to see a transition
p445
aVfrom only institutions to only cooperative framework."
p446
aVIt's going to be much more complicated than that.
p447
aVBut the point is that it's going to be a massive readjustment.
p448
aVAnd since we can see it in advance and know it's coming,
p449
aVmy argument is essentially: we might as well get good at it.
p450
aVThank you very much.

VI have 18 minutes to tell you what happened
p5
aVover the past six million years.
p6
aVAll right.
p7
aVWe all have come from a long way,
p8
aVhere in Africa, and converged in this region of Africa,
p9
aVwhich is a place where 90 percent of our evolutionary process took place.
p10
aVAnd I say that not because I am African,
p11
aVbut it's in Africa that you find the earliest evidence
p12
aVfor human ancestors, upright walking traces,
p13
aVeven the first technologies in the form of stone tools.
p14
aVSo we all are Africans, and welcome home.
p15
aVAll right.
p16
aa(lp17
VI'm a paleoanthropologist, and my job is to define
p18
aVman's place in nature and explore what makes us human.
p19
aVAnd today, I will use Selam, the earliest child ever discovered,
p20
aVto tell you a story of all of us.
p21
aVSelam is our most complete skeleton of a three-year-old girl
p22
aVwho lived and died 3.3 million years ago.
p23
aVShe belongs to the species known as Australopithecus afarensis.
p24
aVYou don't need to remember that.
p25
aVThat's the Lucy species, and was found by my research team
p26
aVin December of 2000 in an area called Dikika.
p27
aVIt's in the northeastern part of Ethiopia.
p28
aVAnd Selam means peace in many Ethiopian languages.
p29
aVWe use that name to celebrate peace in the region and in the planet.
p30
aVAnd the fact that it was the cover story of all these famous magazines
p31
aVgives you already an idea of her significance, I think.
p32
aa(lp33
VAfter I was invited by TED, I did some digging,
p34
aVbecause that's what we do, to know about my host.
p35
aVYou don't just jump into an invitation.
p36
aVAnd I learned that the first technology appeared
p37
aVin the form of stone tools, 2.6 million years ago.
p38
aVFirst entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are 35,000 years old.
p39
aVAnd evidence for first design comes 75,000 years old \u2014 beads.
p40
aVAnd you can do the same with your genes and track them back in time.
p41
aVAnd DNA analysis of living humans and chimpanzees
p42
aVteaches us today that we diverged sometime around seven million years ago
p43
aVand that these two species share over 98 percent of the same genetic material.
p44
aVI think knowing this is a very useful context
p45
aVwithin which we can think of our ancestry.
p46
aa(lp47
VHowever, DNA analysis informs us only about
p48
aVthe beginning and the end, telling us nothing
p49
aVabout what happened in the middle.
p50
aVSo, for us, paleoanthropologists, our job is to find the hard evidence,
p51
aVthe fossil evidence, to fill in this gap
p52
aVand see the different stages of development.
p53
aVBecause it's only when you do that, that you can talk about \u2014
p54
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p55
aVit's only when you do that, [that] you can talk about
p56
aVhow we looked like and how we behaved at different times,
p57
aVand how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time.
p58
aVThat then gives you an access
p59
aVto explore the biological mechanisms
p60
aVand forces that are responsible for this gradual change
p61
aVthat made us what we are today.
p62
aVBut finding the hard evidence is a very complicated endeavor.
p63
aVIt's a systematic and scientific approach,
p64
aVwhich takes you to places that are remote, hot, hostile and often with no access.
p65
aa(lp66
VJust to give you an example, when I went to Dikika,
p67
aVwhere Selam was found, in '99 \u2014 and it's about 500 kilometers
p68
aVfrom Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.
p69
aVIt took us only seven hours to do the first 470 kilometers of the 500,
p70
aVbut took four, solid hours to do the last only 30 kilometers.
p71
aVWith the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks, I made my way.
p72
aVI was the first person to actually drive a car to the spot.
p73
aVWhen you get there, this is what you see,
p74
aVand it's the vastness of the place which makes you feel helpless and vulnerable.
p75
aVAnd once you make it there, the big question is where to start.
p76
aV(Laughter)
p77
aVAnd you find nothing for years and years.
p78
aa(lp79
VWhen I go to places like this, which are paleontological sites,
p80
aVit's like going to a game park, an extinct game park.
p81
aVBut what you find are not the human remains,
p82
aVsuch as Selam and Lucy, on a day-to-day basis.
p83
aVYou find elephants, rhinos, monkeys, pigs, etc.
p84
aVBut you could ask, how could these large mammals
p85
aVlive in this desert environment?
p86
aVOf course, they cannot, but I'm telling you already
p87
aVthat the environment and the carrying capacity
p88
aVof this region was drastically different from what we have today.
p89
aVA very important environmental lesson could be learned from this.
p90
aVAnyway, once we made it there, then it's a game park, as I said, an extinct game park.
p91
aVAnd our ancestors lived in that game park,
p92
aVbut were just the minorities. They were not as successful
p93
aVand as widespread as the Homo sapiens that we are.
p94
aa(lp95
VTo tell you just an example, an anecdote about their rarity,
p96
aVI was going to this place every year and would do fieldwork here,
p97
aVand the assistants, of course, helped me do the surveys.
p98
aVThey would find a bone and tell me, "Here is what you're looking for."
p99
aVI would say, "No, that's an elephant."
p100
aVAgain, another one, "That's a monkey." "That's a pig," etc.
p101
aVSo one of my assistants, who never went to school, said to me, "Listen, Zeray.
p102
aVYou either don't know what you're looking for,
p103
aVor you're looking in the wrong place," he said.
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aVAnd I said, "Why?" "Because there were elephants and lions,
p106
aVand the people were scared and went somewhere else.
p107
aVLet's go somewhere else."
p108
aVWell, he was very tired, and it's really tiring.
p109
aa(lp110
VIt was then, after such hard work and many frustrating years that we found Selam,
p111
aVand you see the face here covered by sandstone.
p112
aVAnd here is actually the spinal column
p113
aVand the whole torso encased in a sandstone block,
p114
aVbecause she was buried by a river.
p115
aVWhat you have here seems to be nothing,
p116
aVbut contains an incredible amount of scientific information
p117
aVthat helps us explore what makes us human.
p118
aVThis is the earliest and most complete juvenile human ancestor
p119
aVever found in the history of paleoanthropology,
p120
aVan amazing piece of our long, long history.
p121
aVThere were these three people and me, and I am taking the pictures,
p122
aVthat's why I am not in.
p123
aa(lp124
VHow would you feel if you were me? You have something extraordinary in your hand,
p125
aVbut you are in the middle of nowhere?
p126
aVThe feeling I had was a deep and quiet happiness and excitement,
p127
aVof course accompanied by a huge sense of responsibility,
p128
aVof making sure everything is safe.
p129
aa(lp130
VHere is a close-up of the fossil, after five years of cleaning,
p131
aVpreparation and description, which was very long,
p132
aVas I had to expose the bones from the sandstone block
p133
aVI just showed you in the previous slide.
p134
aVIt took five years.
p135
aVIn a way, this was like the second birth for the child, after 3.3 million years,
p136
aVbut the labor was very long.
p137
aVAnd here is full scale \u2014 it's a tiny bone.
p138
aVAnd in the middle is the minister of Ethiopian tourism,
p139
aVwho came to visit the National Museum of Ethiopia while I was working there.
p140
aVAnd you see me worried and trying to protect my child,
p141
aVbecause you don't leave anyone with this kind of child,
p142
aVeven a minister.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo then, once you've done that, the next stage is to know what it is.
p145
aV(Laughter)
p146
aVOnce that was done, then it was possible to compare.
p147
aVWe were able to tell that she belonged
p148
aVto the human family tree because the legs, the foot,
p149
aVand some features clearly showed that she walked upright,
p150
aVand upright walking is a hallmark in humanity.
p151
aVBut in addition, if you compare the skull
p152
aVwith a comparably aged chimpanzee and little George Bush here,
p153
aVyou see that you have vertical forehead.
p154
aVAnd you see that in humans, because of the development
p155
aVof the pre-frontal cortex, it's called.
p156
aVYou don't see that in chimpanzees,
p157
aVand you don't see this very projecting canine.
p158
aVSo she belongs to our family tree, but within that, of course,
p159
aVyou do detailed analysis, and we know now
p160
aVthat she belongs to the Lucy species,
p161
aVknown as Australopithecus afarensis.
p162
aa(lp163
VThe next exciting question is, girl or boy?
p164
aVAnd how old was she when she died?
p165
aVYou can determine the sex of the individual
p166
aVbased on the size of the teeth.
p167
aVHow?
p168
aVYou know, in primates, there is this phenomenon
p169
aVcalled sexual dimorphism, which simply means
p170
aVmales are larger than females and males have larger teeth
p171
aVthan the females.
p172
aVBut to do that, you need the permanent dentition,
p173
aVwhich you don't see here, because what you have here
p174
aVare the baby teeth.
p175
aVBut using the CT scanning technology,
p176
aVwhich is normally used for medical purposes,
p177
aVyou can go deep into the mouth and come up with this beautiful image
p178
aVshowing you both the baby teeth here
p179
aVand the still-growing adult teeth here.
p180
aVSo when you measure those teeth,
p181
aVit was clear that she turned out to be a girl
p182
aVwith very small canine teeth.
p183
aVAnd to know how old she was when she died, what you do is
p184
aVyou do an informed estimate, and you say, how much time would be required
p185
aVto form this amount of teeth, and the answer was three.
p186
aVSo, this girl died when she was about three,
p187
aV3.3 million years ago.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo, with all that information, the big question is \u2014
p190
aVwhat do we actually \u2014 what does she tell us?
p191
aVTo answer this question, we can phrase another question.
p192
aVWhat do we actually know about our ancestors?
p193
aVWe want to know how they looked like, how they behaved,
p194
aVhow they walked around,
p195
aVand how they lived and grew up.
p196
aVAnd among the answers that you can get from this skeleton
p197
aVare included: first, this skeleton documents,
p198
aVfor the first time, how infants looked over three million years ago.
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd second, she tells us that she walked upright,
p201
aVbut had some adaptation for tree climbing.
p202
aVAnd more interesting, however,
p203
aVis the brain in this child was still growing.
p204
aVAt age three, if you have a still-growing brain,
p205
aVit's a human behavior.
p206
aVIn chimps, by age three, the brain is formed over 90 percent.
p207
aVThat's why they can cope with their environment
p208
aVvery easily after birth \u2014 faster than us, anyway.
p209
aVBut in humans, we continue to grow our brains.
p210
aVThat's why we need care from our parents.
p211
aVBut that care means also you learn.
p212
aVYou spend more time with your parents.
p213
aVAnd that's very characteristic of humans and it's called childhood,
p214
aVwhich is this extended dependence of human children
p215
aVon their family or parents.
p216
aVSo, the still-growing brain in this individual
p217
aVtells us that childhood, which requires
p218
aVan incredible social organization,
p219
aVa very complex social organization,
p220
aVemerged over three million years ago.
p221
aa(lp222
VSo, by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history,
p223
aVSelam unites us all and gives us a unique account
p224
aVon what makes us human.
p225
aVBut not everything was human, and I will give you
p226
aVa very exciting example.
p227
aVThis is called the hyoid bone. It's a bone which is right here.
p228
aVIt supports your tongue from behind.
p229
aVIt's, in a way, your voice box.
p230
aVIt determines the type of voice you produce.
p231
aVIt was not known in the fossil record,
p232
aVand we have it in this skeleton.
p233
aVWhen we did the analysis of this bone, it was clear
p234
aVthat it looked very chimp-like, chimpanzee-like.
p235
aVSo if you were there 3.3 million years ago,
p236
aVto hear when this girl was crying out for her mother,
p237
aVshe would have sounded more like a chimpanzee than a human.
p238
aVMaybe you're wondering, "So, you see this ape feature, human feature, ape feature.
p239
aVWhat does that tell us?"
p240
aVYou know, that is very exciting for us,
p241
aVbecause it demonstrates that things were changing slowly and progressively,
p242
aVand that evolution is in the making.
p243
aa(lp244
VTo summarize the significance of this fossil,
p245
aVwe can say the following.
p246
aVUp to now, the knowledge that we had about our ancestors
p247
aVcame essentially from adult individuals
p248
aVbecause the fossils, the baby fossils, were missing.
p249
aVThey don't preserve well, as you know.
p250
aVSo the knowledge that we had about our ancestors,
p251
aVon how they looked like, how they behaved,
p252
aVwas kind of biased toward adults.
p253
aVImagine somebody coming from Mars
p254
aVand his job is to report on the type of people
p255
aVoccupying our planet Earth, and you hide all the babies,
p256
aVthe children, and he goes back and reports.
p257
aVCan you imagine how much biased his report would be?
p258
aVThat's what somehow we were doing so far
p259
aVin the absence of the fossil children,
p260
aVso I think the new fossil fixes this problem.
p261
aa(lp262
VSo, I think the most important question at the end is,
p263
aVwhat do we actually learn from specimens like this
p264
aVand from our past in general?
p265
aVOf course, in addition to extracting this huge amount
p266
aVof scientific information as to what makes us human,
p267
aVyou know, the many human ancestors that have existed
p268
aVover the past six million years \u2014 and there are more than 10 \u2014
p269
aVthey did not have the knowledge, the technology and sophistications
p270
aVthat we, Homo sapiens, have today.
p271
aVBut if this species, ancient species,
p272
aVwould travel in time and see us today,
p273
aVthey would very much be very proud of their legacy,
p274
aVbecause they became the ancestors of
p275
aVthe most successful species in the universe.
p276
aVAnd they were probably not aware of this future legacy,
p277
aVbut they did great.
p278
aVNow the question is, we Homo sapiens today
p279
aVare in a position to decide about the future of our planet, possibly more.
p280
aVSo the question is, are we up to the challenge?
p281
aVAnd can we really do better than these primitive,
p282
aVsmall-brained ancestors?
p283
aa(lp284
VAmong the most pressing challenges that our species
p285
aVis faced with today are the chronic problems of Africa.
p286
aVNeedless to list them here, and there are more competent people
p287
aVto talk about this.
p288
aVStill, in my opinion, we have two choices.
p289
aVOne is to continue to see a poor, ill, crying Africa,
p290
aVcarrying guns, that depends on other people forever,
p291
aVor to promote an Africa which is confident,
p292
aVpeaceful, independent, but cognizant of its huge problems
p293
aVand great values at the same time.
p294
aVI am for the second option, and I'm sure many of you are.
p295
aVAnd the key is to promote a positive African attitude towards Africa.
p296
aa(lp297
VThat's because we Africans concentrate \u2014
p298
aVI am from Ethiopia, by the way \u2014
p299
aVwe concentrate too much on how we are seen
p300
aVfrom elsewhere, or from outside.
p301
aVI think it's important to promote in a more positive way
p302
aVon how we see ourselves.
p303
aVThat's what I call positive African attitude.
p304
aVSo finally, I would like to say,
p305
aVso let's help Africa walk upright and forward,
p306
aVthen we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species.
p307
aa(lp308
VThank you.

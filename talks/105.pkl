VWhen you think about resilience and technology it's actually much easier.
p5
aVYou're going to see some other speakers today, I already know,
p6
aVwho are going to talk about breaking-bones stuff,
p7
aVand, of course, with technology it never is.
p8
aVSo it's very easy, comparatively speaking, to be resilient.
p9
aVI think that, if we look at what happened on the Internet,
p10
aVwith such an incredible last half a dozen years,
p11
aVthat it's hard to even get the right analogy for it.
p12
aVA lot of how we decide, how we're supposed to react to things
p13
aVand what we're supposed to expect about the future
p14
aVdepends on how we bucket things
p15
aVand how we categorize them.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd so I think the tempting analogy for the boom-bust
p18
aVthat we just went through with the Internet is a gold rush.
p19
aVIt's easy to think of this analogy as very different
p20
aVfrom some of the other things you might pick.
p21
aVFor one thing, both were very real.
p22
aVIn 1849, in that Gold Rush, they took over $700 million
p23
aVworth of gold out of California. It was very real.
p24
aVThe Internet was also very real. This is a real way for humans to
p25
aVcommunicate with each other. It's a big deal.
p26
aVHuge boom. Huge boom. Huge bust. Huge bust.
p27
aVYou keep going, and both things are lots of hype.
p28
aVI don't have to remind you of all the hype
p29
aVthat was involved with the Internet \u2014 like GetRich.com.
p30
aa(lp31
VBut you had the same thing with the Gold Rush. "Gold. Gold. Gold."
p32
aVSixty-eight rich men on the Steamer Portland. Stacks of yellow metal.
p33
aVSome have 5,000. Many have more.
p34
aVA few bring out 100,000 dollars each.
p35
aVPeople would get very excited about this when they read these articles.
p36
aV"The Eldorado of the United States of America:
p37
aVthe discovery of inexhaustible gold mines in California."
p38
aVAnd the parallels between the Gold Rush and the Internet Rush continue very strongly.
p39
aVSo many people left what they were doing.
p40
aVAnd what would happen is \u2014 and the Gold Rush went on for years.
p41
aa(lp42
VPeople on the East Coast in 1849, when they first started to get the news,
p43
aVthey thought, "Ah, this isn't real."
p44
aVBut they keep hearing about people getting rich,
p45
aVand then in 1850 they still hear that. And they think it's not real.
p46
aVBy about 1852, they're thinking, "Am I the stupidest person on Earth
p47
aVby not rushing to California?" And they start to decide they are.
p48
aVThese are community affairs, by the way.
p49
aVLocal communities on the East Coast would get together and whole teams
p50
aVof 10, 20 people would caravan across the United States,
p51
aVand they would form companies.
p52
aVThese were typically not solitary efforts. But no matter what,
p53
aVif you were a lawyer or a banker, people dropped what they were doing,
p54
aVno matter what skill set they had, to go pan for gold.
p55
aa(lp56
VThis guy on the left, Dr. Richard Beverley Cole,
p57
aVhe lived in Philadelphia and he took the Panama route.
p58
aVThey would take a ship down to Panama, across the isthmus,
p59
aVand then take another ship north.
p60
aVThis guy, Dr. Toland, went by covered wagon to California.
p61
aVThis has its parallels, too. Doctors leaving their practices.
p62
aVThese are both very successful \u2014 a physician in one case,
p63
aVa surgeon in the other.
p64
aVSame thing happened on the Internet. You get DrKoop.com.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VIn the Gold Rush, people literally jumped ship.
p69
aVThe San Francisco harbor was clogged with 600 ships at the peak
p70
aVbecause the ships would get there and the crews would abandon
p71
aVto go search for gold.
p72
aVSo there were literally 600 captains and 600 ships.
p73
aVThey turned the ships into hotels, because they couldn't sail them anywhere.
p74
aVYou had dotcom fever. And you had gold fever.
p75
aVAnd you saw some of the excesses
p76
aVthat the dotcom fever created and the same thing happened.
p77
aVThe fort in San Francisco at the time had about 1,300 soldiers.
p78
aVHalf of them deserted to go look for gold.
p79
aVAnd they wouldn't let the other half out to go look for the first half
p80
aVbecause they were afraid they wouldn't come back.
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd one of the soldiers wrote home, and this is the sentence that he put:
p85
aV"The struggle between right and six dollars a month
p86
aVand wrong and 75 dollars a day is a rather severe one."
p87
aVThey had bad burn rate in the Gold Rush. A very bad burn rate.
p88
aVThis is actually from the Klondike Gold Rush. This is the White Pass Trail.
p89
aVThey loaded up their mules and their horses.
p90
aVAnd they didn't plan right.
p91
aVAnd they didn't know how far they would really have to go,
p92
aVand they overloaded the horses with hundreds and hundreds of pounds of stuff.
p93
aVIn fact it was so bad that most of the horses died
p94
aVbefore they could get where they were going.
p95
aVIt got renamed the "Dead Horse Trail."
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd the Canadian Minister of the Interior wrote this at the time:
p98
aV"Thousands of pack horses lie dead along the way,
p99
aVsometimes in bunches under the cliffs,
p100
aVwith pack saddles and packs where they've fallen from the rock above,
p101
aVsometimes in tangled masses, filling the mud holes
p102
aVand furnishing the only footing for our poor pack animals on the march,
p103
aVoften, I regret to say, exhausted, but still alive,
p104
aVa fact we were unaware of, until after the miserable wretches
p105
aVturned beneath the hooves of our cavalcade.
p106
aVThe eyeless sockets of the pack animals everywhere
p107
aVaccount for the myriads of ravens along the road.
p108
aVThe inhumanity which this trail has been witness to,
p109
aVthe heartbreak and suffering which so many have undergone,
p110
aVcannot be imagined. They certainly cannot be described."
p111
aa(lp112
VAnd you know, without the smell that would have accompanied that,
p113
aVwe had the same thing on the Internet: very bad burn rate calculations.
p114
aVI'll just play one of these and you'll remember it.
p115
aVThis is a commercial that was played on the Super Bowl in the year 2000.
p116
aa(lp117
V(Video): Bride #1: You said you had a large selection of invitations. Clerk: But we do.
p118
aVBride #2: Then why does she have my invitation?
p119
aVAnnouncer: What may be a little thing to some ... Bride #3: You are mine, little man.
p120
aVAnnouncer: Could be a really big deal to you. Husband #1: Is that your wife?
p121
aVHusband #2: Not for another 15 minutes. Announcer: After all, it's your special day.
p122
aVOurBeginning.com. Life's an event. Announce it to the world.
p123
aa(lp124
VJeff Bezos: It's very difficult to figure out what that ad is for.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VBut they spent three and a half million dollars
p129
aVin the 2000 Super Bowl to air that ad,
p130
aVeven though, at the time, they only had a million dollars in annual revenue.
p131
aVNow, here's where our analogy with the Gold Rush starts to diverge,
p132
aVand I think rather severely.
p133
aVAnd that is, in a gold rush, when it's over, it's over.
p134
aVHere's this guy: "There are many men in Dawson
p135
aVat the present time who feel keenly disappointed.
p136
aVThey've come thousands of miles on a perilous trip, risked life, health and property,
p137
aVspent months of the most arduous labor a man can perform
p138
aVand at length with expectations raised to the highest pitch
p139
aVhave reached the coveted goal only to discover
p140
aVthe fact that there is nothing here for them."
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd that was, of course, the very common story.
p143
aVBecause when you take out that last piece of gold \u2014
p144
aVand they did incredibly quickly. I mean, if you look at the 1849 Gold Rush \u2014
p145
aVthe entire American river region, within two years \u2014
p146
aVevery stone had been turned. And after that, only big companies
p147
aVwho used more sophisticated mining technologies
p148
aVstarted to take gold out of there.
p149
aVSo there's a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic
p150
aVand that analogy is the electric industry.
p151
aVAnd there are a lot of similarities between the Internet and the electric industry.
p152
aVWith the electric industry you actually have to \u2014
p153
aVone of them is that they're both sort of thin,
p154
aVhorizontal, enabling layers that go across lots of different industries.
p155
aVIt's not a specific thing.
p156
aa(lp157
VBut electricity is also very, very broad, so you have to sort of narrow it down.
p158
aVYou know, it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power.
p159
aVIt's an incredible means of coordinating,
p160
aVin a very fine-grained way, information flows.
p161
aVThere's a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity.
p162
aVAnd the part of the electric revolution that I want to focus on
p163
aVis sort of the golden age of appliances.
p164
aVThe killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb.
p165
aVSo the light bulb is what wired the world.
p166
aVAnd they weren't thinking about appliances when they wired the world.
p167
aVThey were really thinking about \u2014
p168
aVthey weren't putting electricity into the home;
p169
aVthey were putting lighting into the home.
p170
aVAnd, but it really \u2014 it got the electricity. It took a long time.
p171
aa(lp172
VThis was a huge \u2014 as you would expect \u2014 a huge capital build out.
p173
aVAll the streets had to be torn up.
p174
aVThis is work going on down in lower Manhattan
p175
aVwhere they built some of the first electric power generating stations.
p176
aVAnd they're tearing up all the streets.
p177
aVThe Edison Electric Company, which became Edison General Electric,
p178
aVwhich became General Electric,
p179
aVpaid for all of this digging up of the streets. It was incredibly expensive.
p180
aVBut that is not the \u2014 and that's not the part that's really most similar to the Web.
p181
aVBecause, remember, the Web got to stand
p182
aVon top of all this heavy infrastructure
p183
aVthat had been put in place because of the long-distance phone network.
p184
aVSo all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure \u2014
p185
aVI'm going back now to, sort of, the explosive part of the Web in 1994,
p186
aVwhen it was growing 2,300 percent a year.
p187
aVHow could it grow at 2,300 percent a year in 1994
p188
aVwhen people weren't really investing in the Web?
p189
aVWell, it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo the light bulb laid down the heavy infrastructure,
p192
aVand then home appliances started coming into being.
p193
aVAnd this was huge. The first one was the electric fan \u2014
p194
aVthis was the 1890 electric fan.
p195
aVAnd the appliances, the golden age of appliances really lasted \u2014
p196
aVit depends how you want to measure it \u2014
p197
aVbut it's anywhere from 40 to 60 years. It goes on a long time.
p198
aVIt starts about 1890. And the electric fan was a big success.
p199
aVThe electric iron, also very big.
p200
aVBy the way, this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit.
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VThere's asbestos under that handle there.
p205
aVThis is the first vacuum cleaner, the 1905 Skinner Vacuum,
p206
aVfrom the Hoover Company. And this one weighed 92 pounds
p207
aVand took two people to operate and cost a quarter of a car.
p208
aVSo it wasn't a big seller.
p209
aVThis was truly, truly an early-adopter product \u2014
p210
aV(Laughter)
p211
aVthe 1905 Skinner Vacuum.
p212
aVBut three years later, by 1908, it weighed 40 pounds.
p213
aVNow, not all these things were highly successful.
p214
aa(lp215
V(Laughter)
p216
aa(lp217
VThis is the electric tie press, which never really did catch on.
p218
aVPeople, I guess, decided that they would not wrinkle their ties.
p219
aVThese never really caught on either:
p220
aVthe electric shoe warmer and drier. Never a big seller.
p221
aVThis came in, like, six different colors.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VI don't know why. But I thought, you know,
p226
aVsometimes it's just not the right time for an invention;
p227
aVmaybe it's time to give this one another shot.
p228
aVSo I thought we could build a Super Bowl ad for this.
p229
aVWe'd need the right partner. And I thought that really \u2014
p230
aV(Laughter)
p231
aVI thought that would really work, to give that another shot.
p232
aVNow, the toaster was huge
p233
aVbecause they used to make toast on open fires,
p234
aVand it took a lot of time and attention.
p235
aVI want to point out one thing. This is \u2014 you guys know what this is.
p236
aVThey hadn't invented the electric socket yet.
p237
aVSo this was \u2014 remember, they didn't wire the houses for electricity.
p238
aVThey wired them for lighting. So your \u2014 your appliances would plug in.
p239
aVThey would \u2014 each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top.
p240
aVAnd you'd plug it in there.
p241
aa(lp242
VIn fact, if you've seen the Carousel of Progress at Disney World,
p243
aVyou've seen this. Here are the cables coming up into this light fixture.
p244
aVAll the appliances plug in there. And you would just unscrew your light bulb
p245
aVif you wanted to plug in an appliance.
p246
aVThe next thing that really was a big, big deal was the washing machine.
p247
aVNow, this was an object of much envy and lust.
p248
aVEverybody wanted one of these electric washing machines.
p249
aVOn the left-hand side, this was the soapy water.
p250
aVAnd there's a rotor there \u2014 that this motor is spinning.
p251
aVAnd it would clean your clothes.
p252
aVThis is the clean rinse-water. So you'd take the clothes out of here,
p253
aVput them in here, and then you'd run the clothes through this electric wringer.
p254
aVAnd this was a big deal.
p255
aVYou'd keep this on your porch. It was a little bit messy and kind of a pain.
p256
aVAnd you'd run a long cord into the house
p257
aVwhere you could screw it into your light socket.
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd that's actually kind of an important point in my presentation,
p262
aVbecause they hadn't invented the off switch.
p263
aVThat was to come much later \u2014 the off switch on appliances \u2014
p264
aVbecause it didn't make any sense.
p265
aVI mean, you didn't want this thing clogging up a light socket.
p266
aVSo you know, when you were done with it, you unscrewed it.
p267
aVThat's what you did. You didn't turn it off.
p268
aVAnd as I said before, they hadn't invented the electric outlet either,
p269
aVso the washing machine was a particularly dangerous device.
p270
aVAnd there are \u2014
p271
aVwhen you research this, there are gruesome descriptions
p272
aVof people getting their hair and clothes caught in these devices.
p273
aVAnd they couldn't yank the cord out
p274
aVbecause it was screwed into a light socket inside the house.
p275
aa(lp276
V(Laughter)
p277
aVAnd there was no off switch, so it wasn't very good.
p278
aVAnd you might think that that was incredibly stupid of our ancestors
p279
aVto be plugging things into a light socket like this.
p280
aVBut, you know, before I get too far into condemning our ancestors,
p281
aVI thought I'd show you: this is my conference room.
p282
aVThis is a total kludge, if you ask me.
p283
aVFirst of all, this got installed upside down. This light socket \u2014
p284
aV(Laughter)
p285
aVand so the cord keeps falling out, so I taped it in.
p286
aa(lp287
V(Laughter)
p288
aa(lp289
VThis is supposed \u2014 don't even get me started. But that's not the worst one.
p290
aVThis is what it looks like under my desk.
p291
aVI took this picture just two days ago.
p292
aVSo we really haven't progressed that much since 1908.
p293
aa(lp294
V(Laughter)
p295
aa(lp296
VIt's a total, total mess.
p297
aVAnd, you know, we think it's getting better,
p298
aVbut have you tried to install 802.11 yourself?
p299
aa(lp300
V(Laughter)
p301
aa(lp302
VI challenge you to try. It's very hard.
p303
aVI know Ph.D.s in Computer Science \u2014
p304
aVthis process has brought them to tears, absolute tears. (Laughter)
p305
aVAnd that's assuming you already have DSL in your house.
p306
aVTry to get DSL installed in your house.
p307
aVThe engineers who do it everyday can't do it.
p308
aVThey have to \u2014 typically, they come three times.
p309
aVAnd one friend of mine was telling me a story:
p310
aVnot only did they get there and have to wait,
p311
aVbut then the engineers, when they finally did get there,
p312
aVfor the third time, they had to call somebody.
p313
aVAnd they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone
p314
aVbecause then they had to wait on hold for an hour
p315
aVto talk to somebody to give them an access code
p316
aVafter they got there.
p317
aVSo we're not \u2014 we're pretty kludge-y ourselves.
p318
aa(lp319
VBy the way, DSL is a kludge.
p320
aVI mean, this is a twisted pair of copper that was never designed
p321
aVfor the purpose it's being put to \u2014
p322
aVyou know it's the whole thing \u2014
p323
aVwe're very, very primitive. And that's kind of the point.
p324
aVBecause, you know, resilience \u2014 if you think of it in terms of the Gold Rush,
p325
aVthen you'd be pretty depressed right now
p326
aVbecause the last nugget of gold would be gone.
p327
aVBut the good thing is, with innovation, there isn't a last nugget.
p328
aVEvery new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities.
p329
aa(lp330
VAnd if you believe that, then you believe that where we are \u2014
p331
aVthis is what I think \u2014 I believe that where we are with the incredible kludge \u2014
p332
aVand I haven't even talked about user interfaces on the Web \u2014
p333
aVbut there's so much kludge, so much terrible stuff \u2014
p334
aVwe are at the 1908 Hurley washing machine stage with the Internet.
p335
aVThat's where we are. We don't get our hair caught in it,
p336
aVbut that's the level of primitiveness of where we are.
p337
aVWe're in 1908.
p338
aa(lp339
VAnd if you believe that, then stuff like this doesn't bother you. This is 1996:
p340
aV"All the negatives add up to making the online experience not worth the trouble."
p341
aV1998: "Amazon.toast." In 1999: "Amazon.bomb."
p342
aVMy mom hates this picture.
p343
aa(lp344
V(Laughter)
p345
aa(lp346
VShe \u2014 but you know, if you really do believe that it's the very,
p347
aVvery beginning, if you believe it's the 1908 Hurley washing machine,
p348
aVthen you're incredibly optimistic. And I do think that that's where we are.
p349
aVAnd I do think there's more innovation ahead of us
p350
aVthan there is behind us.
p351
aVAnd in 1917, Sears \u2014 I want to get this exactly right.
p352
aVThis was the advertisement that they ran in 1917.
p353
aVIt says: "Use your electricity for more than light."
p354
aVAnd I think that's where we are.
p355
aVWe're very, very early. Thank you very much.

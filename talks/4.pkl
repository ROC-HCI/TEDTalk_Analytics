VI want to start off by saying, Houston, we have a problem.
p5
aVWe're entering a second generation of no progress
p6
aVin terms of human flight in space. In fact, we've regressed.
p7
aVWe stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth
p8
aVto go out and continue this very important thing
p9
aVthat we as a species have always done.
p10
aVAnd that is, instinctively we've gone out
p11
aVand climbed over difficult places, went to more hostile places,
p12
aVand found out later, maybe to our surprise, that that's the reason we survived.
p13
aVAnd I feel very strongly
p14
aVthat it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids
p15
aVthat think that it's OK to look forward to a better version
p16
aVof a cell phone with a video in it.
p17
aVThey need to look forward to exploration; they need to look forward to colonization;
p18
aVthey need to look forward to breakthroughs.
p19
aVWe need to inspire them, because they need to lead us
p20
aVand help us survive in the future.
p21
aa(lp22
VI'm particularly troubled that what NASA's doing right now with this new Bush doctrine
p23
aVto \u2014 for this next decade and a half \u2014 oh shoot, I screwed up.
p24
aVWe have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics.
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VWhat we're looking forward to is \u2014
p29
aa(lp30
V(Applause)
p31
aa(lp32
Vwhat we're looking forward to
p33
aVis not only the inspiration of our children,
p34
aVbut the current plan right now is not really even allowing
p35
aVthe most creative people in this country \u2014 the Boeing's and Lockheed's
p36
aVspace engineers \u2014 to go out and take risks and try new stuff.
p37
aVWe're going to go back to the moon ... 50 years later?
p38
aVAnd we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new.
p39
aVI'm really troubled by that. But anyway that's \u2014
p40
aVthe basis of the thing that I want to share with you today, though,
p41
aVis that right back to where we inspire people
p42
aVwho will be our great leaders later.
p43
aVThat's the theme of my next 15 minutes here.
p44
aVAnd I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young:
p45
aVthree-year-olds, up to 12-, 14-year-olds.
p46
aVWhat they look at is the most important thing.
p47
aa(lp48
VLet's take a snapshot at aviation.
p49
aVAnd there was a wonderful little short four-year time period
p50
aVwhen marvelous things happened.
p51
aVIt started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said,
p52
aV"Ooh, hey, I can do that." There's only a few people that have flown
p53
aVin early 1908. In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes,
p54
aVthousand of pilots. Airplanes were invented by natural selection.
p55
aVNow you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today,
p56
aVbut there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes.
p57
aVThere were probably at least 30,000 different things tried,
p58
aVand when they crash and kill the pilot, don't try that again.
p59
aVThe ones that flew and landed OK
p60
aVbecause there were no trained pilots
p61
aVwho had good flying qualities by definition.
p62
aVSo we, by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts,
p63
aVin that four-year time period, we invented the concepts
p64
aVof the airplanes that we fly today. And that's why they're so safe,
p65
aVas we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good.
p66
aVThat has not happened at all in space flying.
p67
aVThere's only been two concepts tried \u2014 two by the U.S. and one by the Russians.
p68
aa(lp69
VWell, who was inspired during that time period?
p70
aVAviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought
p71
aVwere the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation.
p72
aVAnd I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them
p73
aVwas a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation.
p74
aVWell, what happened when I was a little kid was \u2014 some pretty heavy stuff too.
p75
aVThe jet age started: the missile age started. Von Braun was on there
p76
aVshowing how to go to Mars \u2014 and this was before Sputnik.
p77
aVAnd this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting
p78
aVthan it is now. We thought there'd be animals there;
p79
aVwe knew there were plants there; the colors change, right?
p80
aVBut, you know, NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots
p81
aVand they've landed it only in the deserts.
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
VIf you look at what happened \u2014 this little black line is as fast as man ever flew,
p86
aVand the red line is top-of-the-line military fighters
p87
aVand the blue line is commercial air transport.
p88
aVYou notice here's a big jump when I was a little kid \u2014
p89
aVand I think that had something to do with giving me the courage
p90
aVto go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try.
p91
aVWell, what did I do when I was a kid?
p92
aVI didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing
p93
aVand, well, we didn't have drugs in those days. But I did competition model airplanes.
p94
aVI spent about seven years during the Vietnam War
p95
aVflight-testing airplanes for the Air Force.
p96
aVAnd then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes
p97
aVthat people could build in their garages.
p98
aVAnd some 3,000 of those are flying. Of course, one of them
p99
aVis around the world Voyager. I founded another company in '82,
p100
aVwhich is my company now.
p101
aVAnd we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982.
p102
aVAnd there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart.
p103
aa(lp104
VThe most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designed
p105
aVonly a dozen years after the first operational jet.
p106
aVStayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service.
p107
aVWe retreated in '98 back to something that was developed in '56. What?
p108
aVThe most impressive spaceship ever, I believe,
p109
aVwas a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a \u2014 you know, it landed on the moon,
p110
aVtake off of the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys \u2014
p111
aVthat's kind of cool.
p112
aVWe've lost that capability. We abandoned it in '72.
p113
aVThis thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961.
p114
aVThree years, and we can't do that now. Crazy.
p115
aa(lp116
VTalk very briefly about innovation cycles, things that grow,
p117
aVhave a lot of activity; they die out when they're replaced by something else.
p118
aVThese things tend to happen every 25 years.
p119
aV40 years long, with an overlap. You can put that statement
p120
aVon all kinds of different technologies. The interesting thing \u2014
p121
aVby the way, the speed here, excuse me, higher-speed travel
p122
aVis the title of these innovation cycles. There is none here.
p123
aVThese two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958.
p124
aVHere's the biggie, and that is, you don't have innovation cycles
p125
aVif the government develops and the government uses it.
p126
aVYou know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net.
p127
aVComputers were used for artillery first, then IRS.
p128
aVBut when we got it, now you have all the level of activity,
p129
aVall the benefit from it. Private sector has to do it.
p130
aVKeep that in mind. I put down innovation \u2014
p131
aVI've looked for innovation cycles in space; I found none.
p132
aa(lp133
VThe very first year, starting when Gagarin went in space,
p134
aVand a few weeks later Alan Shepherd, there were five manned
p135
aVspace flights in the world \u2014 the very first year.
p136
aVIn 2003, everyone that the United States sent to space was killed.
p137
aVThere were only three or four flights in 2003.
p138
aVIn 2004, there were only two flights: two Russian Soyuz flights
p139
aVto the international manned station. And I had to fly three in Mojave
p140
aVwith my little group of a couple dozen people
p141
aVin order to get to a total of five,
p142
aVwhich was the number the same year back in 1961.
p143
aVThere is no growth. There's no activity. There's no nothing.
p144
aa(lp145
VThis is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne.
p146
aVThis is a picture here taken from orbit.
p147
aVOur goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that.
p148
aVWe know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now, do it safe enough \u2014
p149
aVat least as safe as the early airlines \u2014 so that can be done.
p150
aVAnd I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage
p151
aVto go out and try that as a small company.
p152
aa(lp153
VWell, first of all, what's going to happen next?
p154
aVThe first industry will be a high volume, a lot of players.
p155
aVThere's another one announced just last week.
p156
aVAnd it will be sub-orbital. And the reason it has to be sub-orbital
p157
aVis, there is not solutions for adequate safety
p158
aVto fly the public to orbit. The governments have been doing this \u2014
p159
aVthree governments have been doing this for 45 years,
p160
aVand still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died.
p161
aVThat's \u2014 You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record.
p162
aVIt'll be very high volume; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020.
p163
aVI can't tell you when this will start,
p164
aVbecause I don't want my competition to know my schedule.
p165
aVBut I think once it does, we will find solutions,
p166
aVand very quickly, you'll see those resort hotels in orbit.
p167
aVAnd that real easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moon
p168
aVso you have this cool view. And that will be really cool.
p169
aVBecause the moon doesn't have an atmosphere \u2014
p170
aVyou can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want.
p171
aVOh, it's going to be so much fun.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
VOK. My critics say, "Hey, Rutan's just spending
p176
aVa lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires.
p177
aVWhat's this? This is not a transportation system; it's just for fun."
p178
aVAnd I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking,
p179
aVwell, wait a minute. I bought my first Apple computer in 1978
p180
aVand I bought it because I could say, "I got a computer at my house and you don't.
p181
aV'What do you use it for?' Come over. It does Frogger." OK.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VNot the bank's computer or Lockheed's computer,
p186
aVbut the home computer was for games.
p187
aVFor a whole decade it was for fun \u2014 we didn't even know what it was for.
p188
aVBut what happened, the fact that we had this big industry,
p189
aVbig development, big improvement and capability and so on,
p190
aVand they get out there in enough homes \u2014 we were ripe for a new invention.
p191
aVAnd the inventor is in this audience.
p192
aVAl Gore invented the Internet and because of that,
p193
aVsomething that we used for a whole year \u2014 excuse me \u2014
p194
aVa whole decade for fun, became everything \u2014 our commerce, our research,
p195
aVour communication and, if we let the Google guys
p196
aVthink for another couple weekends, we can add a dozen more things to the list. (Laughter)
p197
aVAnd it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids
p198
aVthat we didn't always have computers in our homes.
p199
aVSo fun is defendable.
p200
aa(lp201
VOK, I want to show you kind of a busy chart,
p202
aVbut in it is my prediction with what's going to happen.
p203
aVAnd in it also brings up another point, right here.
p204
aVThere's a group of people that have come forward \u2014
p205
aVand you don't know all of them \u2014 but the ones that have come forward
p206
aVwere inspired as young children, this little three- to 15-year-old age,
p207
aVby us going to orbit and going to the moon here,
p208
aVright in this time period.
p209
aVPaul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family,
p210
aVwhich is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing,
p211
aVBob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack.
p212
aVThese people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area,
p213
aVand I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area
p214
aVof a better cell phone or something \u2014 but they're putting it in very \u2014
p215
aVareas and this will lead us into this kind of capability,
p216
aVand it will lead us into the next really big thing
p217
aVand it will allow us to explore. And I think eventually
p218
aVit will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct.
p219
aa(lp220
VThey were inspired by big progress. But look at the progress that's going on after that.
p221
aVThere were a couple of examples here.
p222
aVThe military fighters had a \u2014 highest-performance military airplane
p223
aVwas the SR71. It went a whole life cycle, got too rusty to fly,
p224
aVand was taken out of service. The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel.
p225
aVIt went a whole life cycle without competition,
p226
aVtook out of service. And we're stuck back here
p227
aVwith the same kind of capability for military fighters
p228
aVand commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '50s.
p229
aa(lp230
VBut something is out there to inspire our kids now.
p231
aVAnd I'm talking about if you've got a baby now,
p232
aVor if you've got a 10-year-old now.
p233
aVWhat's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here.
p234
aVRelatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticket
p235
aVand fly higher and faster than the highest-performance
p236
aVmilitary operational airplane. It's never happened before.
p237
aVThe fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance
p238
aVhas been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes;
p239
aVwhy do you need something better?
p240
aVBut I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying
p241
aVsub-orbital flights to space, very soon \u2014 wait a minute,
p242
aVwhat's happening here, we'll have military fighters
p243
aVwith sub-orbital capability, and I think very soon this.
p244
aVBut the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first.
p245
aVOK, I look forward to a new "capitalist's space race," let's call it.
p246
aa(lp247
VYou remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige,
p248
aVbecause we lost the first two milestones.
p249
aVWe didn't lose them technically. The fact that we had the hardware
p250
aVto put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it \u2014
p251
aVyou can argue that's not a technical loss.
p252
aVSputnik wasn't a technical loss, but it was a prestige loss.
p253
aVAmerica \u2014 the world saw America as not being the leader in technology,
p254
aVand that was a very strong thing.
p255
aVAnd then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin,
p256
aVnot months or decades, or whatever. So we had the capability.
p257
aVBut America lost. We lost. And because of that, we made a big jump to recover it.
p258
aa(lp259
VWell, again, what's interesting here is we've lost
p260
aVto the Russians on the first couple of milestones already.
p261
aVYou cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America \u2014
p262
aVcan't do it. You can buy it in Russia.
p263
aVYou can fly with Russian hardware. This is available
p264
aVbecause a Russian space program is starving,
p265
aVand it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats.
p266
aVIt's commercial. It can be defined as space tourism. They are also offering a trip
p267
aVto go on this whip around the moon, like Apollo 8 was done.
p268
aV100 million bucks \u2014 hey, I can go to the moon.
p269
aVBut, you know, would you have thought back in the '60s,
p270
aVwhen the space race was going on,
p271
aVthat the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do
p272
aVto buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware?
p273
aVAnd would you have thought, would the Russians have thought,
p274
aVthat when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware,
p275
aVthe guys inside won't be Russians? Maybe it'll probably be a Japanese
p276
aVor an American billionaire? Well, that's weird: you know, it really is.
p277
aVBut anyway, I think we need to beat them again.
p278
aa(lp279
VI think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful,
p280
aVprivate space flight industry. Whether we're first or not really doesn't matter.
p281
aVThe Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde.
p282
aVAnd then they flew a few cargo flights, and took it out of service.
p283
aVI think you kind of see the same kind of parallel
p284
aVwhen the commercial stuff is offered.
p285
aa(lp286
VOK, we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight.
p287
aVThis little thing says here: five times
p288
aVwhat NASA's doing by 2020. I want to tell you, already
p289
aVthere's about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion
p290
aVinvestment in private space flight that is not government at all \u2014
p291
aValready, worldwide. If you read \u2014 if you Google it,
p292
aVyou'll find about half of that money, but there's twice of that
p293
aVbeing committed out there \u2014 not spent yet, but being committed
p294
aVand planned for the next few years. Hey, that's pretty big.
p295
aVI'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to be \u2014
p296
aVand it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars
p297
aVon something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost,
p298
aVor less \u2014 this is going to be very profitable.
p299
aVI predict, also, that the investment that will flow into this
p300
aVwill be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpayer
p301
aVspends for NASA's manned spacecraft work.
p302
aVAnd every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently
p303
aVby a factor of 10 to 15. And what that means is before we know it,
p304
aVthe progress in human space flight, with no taxpayer dollars,
p305
aVwill be at a level of about five times as much
p306
aVas the current NASA budgets for human space flight.
p307
aVAnd that is because it's us. It's private industry.
p308
aVYou should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff \u2014
p309
aVand we've done it for a long time. The NACA, before NASA,
p310
aVnever developed an airliner and never ran an airline.
p311
aVBut NASA is developing the space liner, always has,
p312
aVand runs the only space line, OK. And we've shied away from it
p313
aVbecause we're afraid of it. But starting back in June of 2004,
p314
aVwhen I showed that a little group out there actually can do it,
p315
aVcan get a start with it, everything changed after that time.
p316
aa(lp317
VOK, thank you very much.

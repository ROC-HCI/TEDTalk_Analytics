VSo this is a talk about gene drives,
p5
aVbut I'm going to start by telling you a brief story.
p6
aV20 years ago, a biologist named Anthony James
p7
aVgot obsessed with the idea of making mosquitos
p8
aVthat didn't transmit malaria.
p9
aa(lp10
VIt was a great idea, and pretty much a complete failure.
p11
aVFor one thing, it turned out to be really hard
p12
aVto make a malaria-resistant mosquito.
p13
aVJames managed it, finally, just a few years ago,
p14
aVby adding some genes that make it impossible
p15
aVfor the malaria parasite to survive inside the mosquito.
p16
aa(lp17
VBut that just created another problem.
p18
aVNow that you've got a malaria-resistant mosquito,
p19
aVhow do you get it to replace all the malaria-carrying mosquitos?
p20
aVThere are a couple options,
p21
aVbut plan A was basically to breed up
p22
aVa bunch of the new genetically-engineered mosquitos
p23
aVrelease them into the wild
p24
aVand hope that they pass on their genes.
p25
aVThe problem was that you'd have to release
p26
aVliterally 10 times the number of native mosquitos to work.
p27
aVSo in a village with 10,000 mosquitos,
p28
aVyou release an extra 100,000.
p29
aVAs you might guess,
p30
aVthis was not a very popular strategy with the villagers.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VThen, last January, Anthony James got an email
p35
aVfrom a biologist named Ethan Bier.
p36
aVBier said that he and his grad student Valentino Gantz
p37
aVhad stumbled on a tool that could not only guarantee
p38
aVthat a particular genetic trait would be inherited,
p39
aVbut that it would spread incredibly quickly.
p40
aVIf they were right, it would basically solve the problem
p41
aVthat he and James had been working on for 20 years.
p42
aa(lp43
VAs a test, they engineered two mosquitos to carry the anti-malaria gene
p44
aVand also this new tool, a gene drive,
p45
aVwhich I'll explain in a minute.
p46
aVFinally, they set it up so that any mosquitos
p47
aVthat had inherited the anti-malaria gene
p48
aVwouldn't have the usual white eyes, but would instead have red eyes.
p49
aVThat was pretty much just for convenience
p50
aVso they could tell just at a glance which was which.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo they took their two anti-malarial, red-eyed mosquitos
p53
aVand put them in a box with 30 ordinary white-eyed ones,
p54
aVand let them breed.
p55
aVIn two generations, those had produced 3,800 grandchildren.
p56
aVThat is not the surprising part.
p57
aVThis is the surprising part:
p58
aVgiven that you started with just two red-eyed mosquitos
p59
aVand 30 white-eyed ones,
p60
aVyou expect mostly white-eyed descendants.
p61
aVInstead, when James opened the box,
p62
aVall 3,800 mosquitos had red eyes.
p63
aa(lp64
VWhen I asked Ethan Bier about this moment,
p65
aVhe became so excited that he was literally shouting into the phone.
p66
aVThat's because getting only red-eyed mosquitos
p67
aVviolates a rule that is the absolute cornerstone of biology,
p68
aVMendelian genetics.
p69
aVI'll keep this quick,
p70
aVbut Mendelian genetics says when a male and a female mate,
p71
aVtheir baby inherits half of its DNA from each parent.
p72
aVSo if our original mosquito was aa and our new mosquito is aB,
p73
aVwhere B is the anti-malarial gene,
p74
aVthe babies should come out in four permutations:
p75
aVaa, aB, aa, Ba.
p76
aVInstead, with the new gene drive,
p77
aVthey all came out aB.
p78
aVBiologically, that shouldn't even be possible.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo what happened?
p81
aVThe first thing that happened
p82
aVwas the arrival of a gene-editing tool known as CRISPR in 2012.
p83
aVMany of you have probably heard about CRISPR,
p84
aVso I'll just say briefly that CRISPR is a tool that allows researchers
p85
aVto edit genes very precisely, easily and quickly.
p86
aVIt does this by harnessing a mechanism that already existed in bacteria.
p87
aVBasically, there's a protein that acts like a scissors
p88
aVand cuts the DNA,
p89
aVand there's an RNA molecule that directs the scissors
p90
aVto any point on the genome you want.
p91
aVThe result is basically a word processor for genes.
p92
aVYou can take an entire gene out, put one in,
p93
aVor even edit just a single letter within a gene.
p94
aVAnd you can do it in nearly any species.
p95
aa(lp96
VOK, remember how I said that gene drives originally had two problems?
p97
aVThe first was that it was hard to engineer a mosquito
p98
aVto be malaria-resistant.
p99
aVThat's basically gone now, thanks to CRISPR.
p100
aVBut the other problem was logistical.
p101
aVHow do you get your trait to spread?
p102
aVThis is where it gets clever.
p103
aa(lp104
VA couple years ago, a biologist at Harvard named Kevin Esvelt
p105
aVwondered what would happen
p106
aVif you made it so that CRISPR inserted not only your new gene
p107
aVbut also the machinery that does the cutting and pasting.
p108
aVIn other words, what if CRISPR also copied and pasted itself.
p109
aVYou'd end up with a perpetual motion machine for gene editing.
p110
aVAnd that's exactly what happened.
p111
aVThis CRISPR gene drive that Esvelt created
p112
aVnot only guarantees that a trait will get passed on,
p113
aVbut if it's used in the germline cells,
p114
aVit will automatically copy and paste your new gene
p115
aVinto both chromosomes of every single individual.
p116
aVIt's like a global search and replace,
p117
aVor in science terms, it makes a heterozygous trait homozygous.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo, what does this mean?
p120
aVFor one thing, it means we have a very powerful,
p121
aVbut also somewhat alarming new tool.
p122
aVUp until now, the fact that gene drives didn't work very well
p123
aVwas actually kind of a relief.
p124
aVNormally when we mess around with an organism's genes,
p125
aVwe make that thing less evolutionarily fit.
p126
aVSo biologists can make all the mutant fruit flies they want
p127
aVwithout worrying about it.
p128
aVIf some escape, natural selection just takes care of them.
p129
aa(lp130
VWhat's remarkable and powerful and frightening about gene drives
p131
aVis that that will no longer be true.
p132
aVAssuming that your trait does not have a big evolutionary handicap,
p133
aVlike a mosquito that can't fly,
p134
aVthe CRISPR-based gene drive will spread the change relentlessly
p135
aVuntil it is in every single individual in the population.
p136
aVNow, it isn't easy to make a gene drive that works that well,
p137
aVbut James and Esvelt think that we can.
p138
aa(lp139
VThe good news is that this opens the door to some remarkable things.
p140
aVIf you put an anti-malarial gene drive
p141
aVin just 1 percent of Anopheles mosquitoes,
p142
aVthe species that transmits malaria,
p143
aVresearchers estimate that it would spread to the entire population in a year.
p144
aVSo in a year, you could virtually eliminate malaria.
p145
aVIn practice, we're still a few years out from being able to do that,
p146
aVbut still, a 1,000 children a day die of malaria.
p147
aVIn a year, that number could be almost zero.
p148
aVThe same goes for dengue fever, chikungunya, yellow fever.
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd it gets better.
p151
aVSay you want to get rid of an invasive species,
p152
aVlike get Asian carp out of the Great Lakes.
p153
aVAll you have to do is release a gene drive
p154
aVthat makes the fish produce only male offspring.
p155
aVIn a few generations, there'll be no females left, no more carp.
p156
aVIn theory, this means we could restore hundreds of native species
p157
aVthat have been pushed to the brink.
p158
aa(lp159
VOK, that's the good news,
p160
aVthis is the bad news.
p161
aVGene drives are so effective
p162
aVthat even an accidental release could change an entire species,
p163
aVand often very quickly.
p164
aVAnthony James took good precautions.
p165
aVHe bred his mosquitos in a bio-containment lab
p166
aVand he also used a species that's not native to the US
p167
aVso that even if some did escape,
p168
aVthey'd just die off, there'd be nothing for them to mate with.
p169
aVBut it's also true that if a dozen Asian carp with the all-male gene drive
p170
aVaccidentally got carried from the Great Lakes back to Asia,
p171
aVthey could potentially wipe out the native Asian carp population.
p172
aVAnd that's not so unlikely, given how connected our world is.
p173
aVIn fact, it's why we have an invasive species problem.
p174
aVAnd that's fish.
p175
aVThings like mosquitos and fruit flies,
p176
aVthere's literally no way to contain them.
p177
aVThey cross borders and oceans all the time.
p178
aa(lp179
VOK, the other piece of bad news
p180
aVis that a gene drive might not stay confined
p181
aVto what we call the target species.
p182
aVThat's because of gene flow,
p183
aVwhich is a fancy way of saying that neighboring species
p184
aVsometimes interbreed.
p185
aVIf that happens, it's possible a gene drive could cross over,
p186
aVlike Asian carp could infect some other kind of carp.
p187
aVThat's not so bad if your drive just promotes a trait, like eye color.
p188
aVIn fact, there's a decent chance that we'll see
p189
aVa wave of very weird fruit flies in the near future.
p190
aVBut it could be a disaster
p191
aVif your drive is deigned to eliminate the species entirely.
p192
aa(lp193
VThe last worrisome thing is that the technology to do this,
p194
aVto genetically engineer an organism and include a gene drive,
p195
aVis something that basically any lab in the world can do.
p196
aVAn undergraduate can do it.
p197
aVA talented high schooler with some equipment can do it.
p198
aa(lp199
VNow, I'm guessing that this sounds terrifying.
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VInterestingly though, nearly every scientist I talk to
p204
aVseemed to think that gene drives were not actually that frightening or dangerous.
p205
aVPartly because they believe that scientists will be
p206
aVvery cautious and responsible about using them.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VSo far, that's been true.
p211
aVBut gene drives also have some actual limitations.
p212
aVSo for one thing, they work only in sexually reproducing species.
p213
aVSo thank goodness, they can't be used to engineer viruses or bacteria.
p214
aVAlso, the trait spreads only with each successive generation.
p215
aVSo changing or eliminating a population
p216
aVis practical only if that species has a fast reproductive cycle,
p217
aVlike insects or maybe small vertebrates like mice or fish.
p218
aVIn elephants or people, it would take centuries
p219
aVfor a trait to spread widely enough to matter.
p220
aa(lp221
VAlso, even with CRISPR, it's not that easy to engineer a truly devastating trait.
p222
aVSay you wanted to make a fruit fly
p223
aVthat feeds on ordinary fruit instead of rotting fruit,
p224
aVwith the aim of sabotaging American agriculture.
p225
aVFirst, you'd have to figure out
p226
aVwhich genes control what the fly wants to eat,
p227
aVwhich is already a very long and complicated project.
p228
aVThen you'd have to alter those genes to change the fly's behavior
p229
aVto whatever you'd want it to be,
p230
aVwhich is an even longer and more complicated project.
p231
aVAnd it might not even work,
p232
aVbecause the genes that control behavior are complex.
p233
aVSo if you're a terrorist and have to choose
p234
aVbetween starting a grueling basic research program
p235
aVthat will require years of meticulous lab work and still might not pan out,
p236
aVor just blowing stuff up?
p237
aVYou'll probably choose the later.
p238
aa(lp239
VThis is especially true because at least in theory,
p240
aVit should be pretty easy to build what's called a reversal drive.
p241
aVThat's one that basically overwrites the change made by the first gene drive.
p242
aVSo if you don't like the effects of a change,
p243
aVyou can just release a second drive that will cancel it out,
p244
aVat least in theory.
p245
aa(lp246
VOK, so where does this leave us?
p247
aVWe now have the ability to change entire species at will.
p248
aVShould we?
p249
aVAre we gods now?
p250
aVI'm not sure I'd say that.
p251
aVBut I would say this:
p252
aVfirst, some very smart people
p253
aVare even now debating how to regulate gene drives.
p254
aVAt the same time, some other very smart people
p255
aVare working hard to create safeguards,
p256
aVlike gene drives that self-regulate or peter out after a few generations.
p257
aVThat's great.
p258
aVBut this technology still requires a conversation.
p259
aVAnd given the nature of gene drives,
p260
aVthat conversation has to be global.
p261
aVWhat if Kenya wants to use a drive but Tanzania doesn't?
p262
aVWho decides whether to release a gene drive that can fly?
p263
aa(lp264
VI don't have the answer to that question.
p265
aVAll we can do going forward, I think,
p266
aVis talk honestly about the risks and benefits
p267
aVand take responsibility for our choices.
p268
aVBy that I mean, not just the choice to use a gene drive,
p269
aVbut also the choice not to use one.
p270
aVHumans have a tendency to assume that the safest option
p271
aVis to preserve the status quo.
p272
aVBut that's not always the case.
p273
aVGene drives have risks, and those need to be discussed,
p274
aVbut malaria exists now and kills 1,000 people a day.
p275
aVTo combat it, we spray pesticides that do grave damage to other species,
p276
aVincluding amphibians and birds.
p277
aa(lp278
VSo when you hear about gene drives in the coming months,
p279
aVand trust me, you will be hearing about them,
p280
aVremember that.
p281
aVIt can be frightening to act,
p282
aVbut sometimes, not acting is worse.

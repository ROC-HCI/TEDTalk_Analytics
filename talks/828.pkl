VFirst of all, I'm a geek.
p5
aVI'm an organic food-eating,
p6
aVcarbon footprint-minimizing, robotic surgery geek.
p7
aVAnd I really want to build green,
p8
aVbut I'm very suspicious
p9
aVof all of these well-meaning articles,
p10
aVpeople long on moral authority
p11
aVand short on data,
p12
aVtelling me how to do these kinds of things.
p13
aVAnd so I have to figure this out for myself.
p14
aVFor example: Is this evil?
p15
aVI have dropped a blob of organic yogurt
p16
aVfrom happy self-actualized local cows
p17
aVon my counter top,
p18
aVand I grab a paper towel and I want to wipe it up.
p19
aVBut can I use a paper towel? (Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VThe answer to this can be found in embodied energy.
p22
aVThis is the amount of energy that goes into
p23
aVany paper towel or embodied water,
p24
aVand every time I use a paper towel,
p25
aVI am using this much
p26
aVvirtual energy and water.
p27
aVWipe it up, throw it away.
p28
aVNow, if I compare that to a cotton towel
p29
aVthat I can use a thousand times,
p30
aVI don't have a whole lot of embodied energy
p31
aVuntil I wash that yogurty towel.
p32
aVThis is now operating energy.
p33
aVSo if I throw my towel in the washing machine,
p34
aVI've now put energy and water
p35
aVback into that towel ...
p36
aVunless I use a front-loading, high-efficiency washing machine, (Laughter)
p37
aVand then it looks a little bit better.
p38
aVBut what about a recycled paper towel
p39
aVthat comes in those little half sheets?
p40
aVWell, now a paper towel looks better.
p41
aVScrew the paper towels. Let's go to a sponge.
p42
aVI wipe it up with a sponge, and I put it under the running water,
p43
aVand I have a lot less energy and a lot more water.
p44
aVUnless you're like me and you leave the handle
p45
aVin the position of hot even when you turn it on,
p46
aVand then you start to use more energy.
p47
aVOr worse, you let it run until it's warm
p48
aVto rinse out your towel.
p49
aVAnd now all bets are off.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VSo what this says is that
p54
aVsometimes the things that you least expect \u2014
p55
aVthe position in which you put the handle \u2014
p56
aVhave a bigger effect than any of those other things
p57
aVthat you were trying to optimize.
p58
aVNow imagine someone as twisted as me
p59
aVtrying to build a house.
p60
aV(Laughter)
p61
aVThat's what my husband and I are doing right now.
p62
aVAnd so, we wanted to know, how green could we be?
p63
aVAnd there's a thousand and one articles out there
p64
aVtelling us how to make all these green trade-offs.
p65
aVAnd they are just as suspect
p66
aVin telling us to optimize these little things around the edges
p67
aVand missing the elephant in the living room.
p68
aVNow, the average house
p69
aVhas about 300 megawatt hours
p70
aVof embodied energy in it;
p71
aVthis is the energy it takes to make it \u2014
p72
aVmillions and millions of paper towels.
p73
aa(lp74
VWe wanted to know how much better we could do.
p75
aVAnd so, like many people,
p76
aVwe start with a house on a lot,
p77
aVand I'm going to show you a typical construction on the top
p78
aVand what we're doing on the bottom.
p79
aVSo first, we demolish it.
p80
aVIt takes some energy, but if you deconstruct it \u2014
p81
aVyou take it all apart, you use the bits \u2014
p82
aVyou can get some of that energy back.
p83
aVWe then dug a big hole
p84
aVto put in a rainwater catchment tank
p85
aVto take our yard water independent.
p86
aVAnd then we poured a big foundation
p87
aVfor passive solar.
p88
aVNow, you can reduce the embodied energy
p89
aVby about 25 percent
p90
aVby using high fly ash concrete.
p91
aVWe then put in framing.
p92
aVAnd so this is framing \u2014 lumber,
p93
aVcomposite materials \u2014
p94
aVand it's kind of hard to get the embodied energy out of that,
p95
aVbut it can be a sustainable resource
p96
aVif you use FSC-certified lumber.
p97
aa(lp98
VWe then go on to
p99
aVthe first thing that was very surprising.
p100
aVIf we put aluminum windows in this house,
p101
aVwe would double the energy use right there.
p102
aVNow, PVC is a little bit better,
p103
aVbut still not as good as the wood that we chose.
p104
aVWe then put in plumbing,
p105
aVelectrical and HVAC,
p106
aVand insulate.
p107
aVNow, spray foam is an excellent insulator \u2014 it fills in all the cracks \u2014
p108
aVbut it is pretty high embodied energy,
p109
aVand, sprayed-in cellulose or blue jeans
p110
aVis a much lower energy alternative to that.
p111
aVWe also used straw bale
p112
aVinfill for our library,
p113
aVwhich has zero embodied energy.
p114
aVWhen it comes time to sheetrock,
p115
aVif you use EcoRock it's about a quarter
p116
aVof the embodied energy of standard sheetrock.
p117
aa(lp118
VAnd then you get to the finishes,
p119
aVthe subject of all of those "go green" articles,
p120
aVand on the scale of a house
p121
aVthey almost make no difference at all.
p122
aVAnd yet, all the press is focused on that.
p123
aVExcept for flooring.
p124
aVIf you put carpeting in your house,
p125
aVit's about a tenth of the embodied energy of the entire house,
p126
aVunless you use concrete or wood
p127
aVfor a much lower embodied energy.
p128
aVSo now we add in the final construction energy, we add it all up,
p129
aVand we've built a house for less than half
p130
aVof the typical embodied energy for building a house like this.
p131
aa(lp132
VBut before we pat ourselves
p133
aVtoo much on the back,
p134
aVwe have poured 151 megawatt hours
p135
aVof energy into constructing this house
p136
aVwhen there was a house there before.
p137
aVAnd so the question is:
p138
aVHow could we make that back?
p139
aVAnd so if I run my new energy-efficient house forward,
p140
aVcompared with the old, non-energy-efficient house,
p141
aVwe make it back in about six years.
p142
aVNow, I probably would have upgraded the old house
p143
aVto be more energy-efficient,
p144
aVand in that case,
p145
aVit would take me more about 20 years to break even.
p146
aVNow, if I hadn't paid attention to embodied energy,
p147
aVit would have taken us
p148
aVover 50 years to break even
p149
aVcompared to the upgraded house.
p150
aVSo what does this mean?
p151
aVOn the scale of my portion of the house,
p152
aVthis is equivalent to about
p153
aVas much as I drive in a year,
p154
aVit's about five times as much
p155
aVas if I went entirely vegetarian.
p156
aVBut my elephant in the living room flies.
p157
aVClearly, I need to walk home from TED.
p158
aVBut all the calculations
p159
aVfor embodied energy are on the blog.
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd, remember, it's sometimes the things that you are not expecting
p162
aVto be the biggest changes that are.
p163
aa(lp164
VThank you. (Applause)

VI'm going to talk to you today about my work on suspended animation.
p5
aVNow, usually when I mention suspended animation,
p6
aVpeople will flash me the Vulcan sign and laugh.
p7
aVBut now, I'm not talking about gorking people out
p8
aVto fly to Mars or even Pandora,
p9
aVas much fun as that may be.
p10
aVI'm talking about
p11
aVthe concept of using suspended animation
p12
aVto help people out in trauma.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo what do I mean
p15
aVwhen I say "suspended animation"?
p16
aVIt is the process by which
p17
aVanimals de-animate,
p18
aVappear dead
p19
aVand then can wake up again without being harmed.
p20
aVOK, so here is the sort of big idea:
p21
aVIf you look out at nature,
p22
aVyou find that
p23
aVas you tend to see suspended animation,
p24
aVyou tend to see immortality.
p25
aVAnd so, what I'm going to tell you about
p26
aVis a way to tell a person who's in trauma \u2014
p27
aVfind a way to de-animate them a bit
p28
aVso they're a little more immortal
p29
aVwhen they have that heart attack.
p30
aa(lp31
VAn example of an organism or two
p32
aVthat happens to be quite immortal
p33
aVwould be plant seeds
p34
aVor bacterial spores.
p35
aVThese creatures are
p36
aVsome of the most immortal life forms on our planet,
p37
aVand they tend to spend most of their time
p38
aVin suspended animation.
p39
aVBacterial spores are thought now by scientists
p40
aVto exist as individual cells
p41
aVthat are alive, but in suspended animation
p42
aVfor as long as 250 million years.
p43
aVTo suggest that this all, sort of, about little, tiny creatures,
p44
aVI want to bring it close to home.
p45
aVIn the immortal germ line
p46
aVof human beings \u2014
p47
aVthat is, the eggs that sit in the ovaries \u2014
p48
aVthey actually sit there in a state of suspended animation
p49
aVfor up to 50 years in the life of each woman.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo then there's also my favorite example
p52
aVof suspended animation.
p53
aVThis is Sea-Monkeys.
p54
aVThose of you with children,
p55
aVyou know about them.
p56
aVYou go to the pet store or the toy store,
p57
aVand you can buy these things.
p58
aVYou just open the bag, and you just dump them
p59
aVinto the plastic aquarium,
p60
aVand in about a week or so, you'll have little shrimps swimming around.
p61
aVWell, I wasn't so interested in the swimming.
p62
aVI was interested in what was going on in the bag,
p63
aVthe bag on the toy store shelf
p64
aVwhere those shrimp sat
p65
aVin suspended animation indefinitely.
p66
aVSo these ideas of suspended animation
p67
aVare not just about cells and weird, little organisms.
p68
aa(lp69
VOccasionally, human beings
p70
aVare briefly de-animated,
p71
aVand the stories of people who are briefly de-animated
p72
aVthat interest me the most
p73
aVare those having to do with the cold.
p74
aVTen years ago, there was a skier in Norway
p75
aVthat was trapped in an icy waterfall,
p76
aVand she was there for two hours before they extracted her.
p77
aVShe was extremely cold,
p78
aVand she had no heartbeat \u2014
p79
aVfor all intents and purposes she was dead, frozen.
p80
aVSeven hours later,
p81
aVstill without a heartbeat,
p82
aVthey brought her back to life, and she went on to be
p83
aVthe head radiologist
p84
aVin the hospital that treated her.
p85
aa(lp86
VA couple of years later \u2014
p87
aVso I get really excited about these things \u2014
p88
aVabout a couple of years later,
p89
aVthere was a 13-month-old, she was from Canada.
p90
aVHer father had gone out in the wintertime; he was working night shift,
p91
aVand she followed him outside in nothing but a diaper.
p92
aVAnd they found her hours later,
p93
aVfrozen, lifeless,
p94
aVand they brought her back to life.
p95
aa(lp96
VThere was a 65-year-old woman
p97
aVin Duluth, Minnesota last year
p98
aVthat was found frozen and without a pulse
p99
aVin her front yard one morning in the winter,
p100
aVand they brought her back to life.
p101
aVThe next day, she was doing so well, they wanted to run tests on her.
p102
aVShe got cranky and just went home.
p103
aV(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VSo, these are miracles, right?
p106
aVThese are truly miraculous things that happen.
p107
aVDoctors have a saying
p108
aVthat, in fact, "You're not dead until you're warm and dead."
p109
aVAnd it's true. It's true.
p110
aVIn the New England Journal of Medicine,
p111
aVthere was a study published that showed
p112
aVthat with appropriate rewarming,
p113
aVpeople who had suffered without a heartbeat for three hours
p114
aVcould be brought back to life without any neurologic problems.
p115
aVThat's over 50 percent.
p116
aVSo what I was trying to do is think of a way
p117
aVthat we could study
p118
aVsuspended animation
p119
aVto think about a way
p120
aVto reproduce, maybe,
p121
aVwhat happened to the skier.
p122
aa(lp123
VWell, I have to tell you something very odd,
p124
aVand that is that being exposed to low oxygen
p125
aVdoes not always kill.
p126
aVSo, in this room, there's 20 percent oxygen or so,
p127
aVand if we reduce the oxygen concentration,
p128
aVwe will all be dead.
p129
aVAnd, in fact, the animals we were working with in the lab \u2014
p130
aVthese little garden worms, nematodes \u2014
p131
aVthey were also dead when we exposed them to low oxygen.
p132
aVAnd here's the thing that should freak you out.
p133
aVAnd that is that, when we lower the oxygen concentration further
p134
aVby 100 times, to 10 parts per million,
p135
aVthey were not dead,
p136
aVthey were in suspended animation,
p137
aVand we could bring them back to life without any harm.
p138
aVAnd this precise oxygen concentration,
p139
aV10 parts per million,
p140
aVthat caused suspended animation,
p141
aVis conserved.
p142
aVWe can see it in a variety of different organisms.
p143
aVOne of the creatures we see it in
p144
aVis a fish.
p145
aVAnd we can turn its heartbeat on and off by going in and out
p146
aVof suspended animation like you would a light switch.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo this was pretty shocking to me,
p149
aVthat we could do this.
p150
aVAnd so I was wondering, when we were trying
p151
aVto reproduce the work with the skier,
p152
aVthat we noticed that, of course,
p153
aVshe had no oxygen consumption,
p154
aVand so maybe she was in a similar state of suspended animation.
p155
aVBut, of course, she was also extremely cold.
p156
aVSo we wondered what would happen
p157
aVif we took our suspended animals and exposed them to the cold.
p158
aVAnd so, what we found out
p159
aVwas that, if you take animals
p160
aVthat are animated like you and I,
p161
aVand you make them cold \u2014 that is, these were the garden worms \u2014
p162
aVnow they're dead.
p163
aVBut if you have them in suspended animation,
p164
aVand move them into the cold, they're all alive.
p165
aVAnd there's the very important thing there:
p166
aVIf you want to survive the cold,
p167
aVyou ought to be suspended. Right?
p168
aVIt's a really good thing.
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd so, we were thinking about that,
p171
aVabout this relationship between these things,
p172
aVand thinking about whether or not that's what happened to the skier.
p173
aVAnd so we wondered: Might there be some agent
p174
aVthat is in us, something that we make ourselves,
p175
aVthat we might be able to regulate our own metabolic flexibility
p176
aVin such a way as to be able to survive
p177
aVwhen we got extremely cold, and might otherwise pass away?
p178
aVI thought it might be interesting to sort of hunt for such things.
p179
aVYou know?
p180
aa(lp181
VI should mention briefly here
p182
aVthat physiology textbooks that you can read about
p183
aVwill tell you that this is a kind of heretical thing to suggest.
p184
aVWe have, from the time we are slapped on the butt
p185
aVuntil we take our last dying breath \u2014
p186
aVthat's when we're newborn to when we're dead \u2014
p187
aVwe cannot reduce our metabolic rate
p188
aVbelow what's called a standard,
p189
aVor basal metabolic rate.
p190
aVBut I knew that there were examples
p191
aVof creatures, also mammals,
p192
aVthat do reduce their metabolic rate
p193
aVsuch as ground squirrels and bears,
p194
aVthey reduce their metabolic rate
p195
aVin the wintertime when they hibernate.
p196
aVSo I wondered: Might we be able to find some agent or trigger
p197
aVthat might induce such a state in us?
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd so, we went looking for such things.
p200
aVAnd this was a period of time when we failed tremendously.
p201
aVKen Robinson is here. He talked about the glories of failure.
p202
aVWell, we had a lot of them.
p203
aVWe tried many different chemicals and agents,
p204
aVand we failed over and over again.
p205
aVSo, one time, I was at home
p206
aVwatching television on the couch
p207
aVwhile my wife was putting our child to bed,
p208
aVand I was watching a television show.
p209
aVIt was a television show \u2014
p210
aVit was a NOVA show on PBS \u2014
p211
aVabout caves in New Mexico.
p212
aVAnd this particular cave was Lechuguilla,
p213
aVand this cave is incredibly toxic to humans.
p214
aVThe researchers had to suit up just to enter it.
p215
aVIt's filled with this toxic gas,
p216
aVhydrogen sulfide.
p217
aVNow, hydrogen sulfide is curiously present in us.
p218
aVWe make it ourselves.
p219
aVThe highest concentration is in our brains.
p220
aVYet, it was used
p221
aVas a chemical warfare agent in World War I.
p222
aVIt's an extraordinarily toxic thing.
p223
aVIn fact, in chemical accidents,
p224
aVhydrogen sulfide is known to \u2014
p225
aVif you breathe too much of it, you collapse to the ground,
p226
aVyou appear dead,
p227
aVbut if you were brought out into room air, you can be reanimated without harm,
p228
aVif they do that quickly.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo, I thought, "Wow, I have to get some of this."
p231
aV(Laughter)
p232
aVNow, it's post-9/11 America,
p233
aVand when you go into the research institute,
p234
aVand you say, "Hi.
p235
aVI'd like to buy some concentrated,
p236
aVcompressed gas cylinders
p237
aVof a lethal gas
p238
aVbecause I have these ideas, see,
p239
aVabout wanting to suspend people.
p240
aVIt's really going to be OK."
p241
aVSo that's kind of a tough day,
p242
aVbut I said, "There really is
p243
aVsome basis for thinking why you might want to do this."
p244
aVAs I said, this agent is in us,
p245
aVand, in fact, here's a curious thing,
p246
aVit binds to the very place inside of your cells
p247
aVwhere oxygen binds, and where you burn it,
p248
aVand that you do this burning to live.
p249
aVAnd so we thought, like in a game of musical chairs,
p250
aVmight we be able to give a person
p251
aVsome hydrogen sulfide,
p252
aVand might it be able to occupy that place
p253
aVlike in a game of musical chairs where oxygen might bind?
p254
aVAnd because you can't bind the oxygen,
p255
aVmaybe you wouldn't consume it,
p256
aVand then maybe it would reduce your demand for oxygen.
p257
aVI mean, who knows?
p258
aa(lp259
VSo \u2014 (Laughter)
p260
aVSo, there's the bit about the dopamine
p261
aVand being a little bit, what do you call it, delusional,
p262
aVand you might suggest that was it.
p263
aVAnd so, we wanted to find out
p264
aVmight we be able to use
p265
aVhydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold,
p266
aVand we wanted to see whether we could
p267
aVreproduce this skier in a mammal.
p268
aVNow, mammals are warm-blooded creatures,
p269
aVand when we get cold, we shake and we shiver, right?
p270
aVWe try to keep our core temperature at 37 degrees
p271
aVby actually burning more oxygen.
p272
aVSo, it was interesting for us
p273
aVwhen we applied hydrogen sulfide
p274
aVto a mouse when it was also cold
p275
aVbecause what happened is the core temperature
p276
aVof the mouse got cold.
p277
aVIt stopped moving.
p278
aVIt appeared dead.
p279
aVIts oxygen consumption rate
p280
aVfell by tenfold.
p281
aVAnd here's the really important point.
p282
aVI told you hydrogen sulfide is in us.
p283
aVIt's rapidly metabolized,
p284
aVand all you have to do after six hours of being
p285
aVin this state of de-animation
p286
aVis simply put the thing out in room air,
p287
aVand it warms up, and it's none the worse for wear.
p288
aa(lp289
VNow, this was cosmic.
p290
aVReally. Because we had found a way
p291
aVto de-animate a mammal,
p292
aVand it didn't hurt it.
p293
aVNow, we'd found a way to reduce
p294
aVits oxygen consumption
p295
aVto rock-bottom levels, and it was fine.
p296
aVNow, in this state of de-animation,
p297
aVit could not go out dancing,
p298
aVbut it was not dead,
p299
aVand it was not harmed.
p300
aVSo we started to think: Is this the agent
p301
aVthat might have been present in the skier,
p302
aVand might have she had more of it than someone else,
p303
aVand might that have been able to reduce
p304
aVher demand for oxygen
p305
aVbefore she got so cold that
p306
aVshe otherwise would have died,
p307
aVas we found out with our worm experiments?
p308
aa(lp309
VSo, we wondered:
p310
aVCan we do anything useful
p311
aVwith this capacity to
p312
aVcontrol metabolic flexibility?
p313
aVAnd one of the things we wondered \u2014
p314
aVI'm sure some of you out there are economists,
p315
aVand you know all about supply and demand.
p316
aVAnd when supply is equal to demand,
p317
aVeverything's fine,
p318
aVbut when supply falls,
p319
aVin this case of oxygen,
p320
aVand demand stays high, you're dead.
p321
aVSo, what I just told you
p322
aVis we can now reduce demand.
p323
aVWe ought to be able to lower supply
p324
aVto unprecedented low levels without killing the animal.
p325
aVAnd with money we got from DARPA,
p326
aVwe could show just that.
p327
aVIf you give mice hydrogen sulfide,
p328
aVyou can lower their demand for oxygen,
p329
aVand you can put them into oxygen concentrations
p330
aVthat are as low as 5,000 feet above the top of Mt. Everest,
p331
aVand they can sit there for hours, and there's no problem.
p332
aVWell this was really cool.
p333
aVWe also found out that we could subject animals
p334
aVto otherwise lethal blood loss, and we could save them
p335
aVif we gave them hydrogen sulfide.
p336
aa(lp337
VSo these proof of concept experiments
p338
aVled me to say "I should found a company,
p339
aVand we should take this out to a wider playing field."
p340
aVI founded a company called Ikaria
p341
aVwith others' help.
p342
aVAnd this company, the first thing it did
p343
aVwas make a liquid formulation of hydrogen sulfide
p344
aVan injectable form that we could put in
p345
aVand send it out to physician scientists all over the world
p346
aVwho work on models of critical care medicine,
p347
aVand the results are incredibly positive.
p348
aa(lp349
VIn one model of heart attack,
p350
aVanimals given hydrogen sulfide
p351
aVshowed a 70 percent reduction in heart damage
p352
aVcompared to those who got the standard of care that
p353
aVyou and I would receive if we were to have a heart attack here today.
p354
aVSame is true for organ failure,
p355
aVwhen you have loss of function owing to poor perfusion of kidney, of liver,
p356
aVacute respiratory distress syndrome
p357
aVand damage suffered in cardiac-bypass surgery.
p358
aVSo, these are the thought leaders in trauma medicine
p359
aVall over the world saying this is true,
p360
aVso it seems that exposure to hydrogen sulfide
p361
aVdecreases damage that you receive
p362
aVfrom being exposed to otherwise lethal-low oxygen.
p363
aa(lp364
VAnd I should say that the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide
p365
aVrequired to get this benefit
p366
aVare low, incredibly low.
p367
aVIn fact, so low that physicians will not have to lower or dim
p368
aVthe metabolism of people much at all
p369
aVto see the benefit I just mentioned,
p370
aVwhich is a wonderful thing, if you're thinking about adopting this.
p371
aVYou don't want to be gorking people out
p372
aVjust to save them, it's really confusing.
p373
aV(Laughter)
p374
aa(lp375
VSo, I want to say that we're in human trials.
p376
aVNow, and so \u2014
p377
aV(Applause)
p378
aVThank you. The Phase 1 safety studies are over,
p379
aVand we're doing fine, we're now moved on.
p380
aVWe have to get to Phase 2 and Phase 3. It's going to take us a few years.
p381
aVThis has all moved very quickly,
p382
aVand the mouse experiments
p383
aVof hibernating mice happened in 2005;
p384
aVthe first human studies were done in 2008,
p385
aVand we should know in a couple of years
p386
aVwhether it works or not.
p387
aVAnd this all happened really quickly
p388
aVbecause of a lot of help from a lot of people.
p389
aa(lp390
VI want to mention that, first of all,
p391
aVmy wife, without whom this talk and my work would not be possible,
p392
aVso thank you very much.
p393
aVAlso, the brilliant scientists who work at my lab
p394
aVand also others on staff,
p395
aVthe Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington \u2014
p396
aVwonderful place to work.
p397
aVAnd also the wonderful scientists
p398
aVand businesspeople at Ikaria.
p399
aVOne thing those people did out there
p400
aVwas take this technology of hydrogen sulfide,
p401
aVwhich is this start-up company that's burning venture capital very quickly,
p402
aVand they fused it with another company
p403
aVthat sells another toxic gas
p404
aVthat's more toxic than hydrogen sulfide,
p405
aVand they give it to newborn babies who would otherwise die
p406
aVfrom a failure to be able to oxygenate their tissues properly.
p407
aVAnd this gas that is delivered in over
p408
aVa thousand critical care hospitals worldwide,
p409
aVnow is approved, on label,
p410
aVand saves thousands of babies a year
p411
aVfrom certain death.
p412
aV(Applause)
p413
aa(lp414
VSo it's really incredible
p415
aVfor me to be a part of this.
p416
aVAnd I want to say that I think we're on the path
p417
aVof understanding metabolic flexibility
p418
aVin a fundamental way,
p419
aVand that in the not too distant future,
p420
aVan EMT might give an injection of hydrogen sulfide,
p421
aVor some related compound,
p422
aVto a person suffering severe injuries,
p423
aVand that person might de-animate a bit,
p424
aVthey might become a little more immortal.
p425
aVTheir metabolism will fall
p426
aVas though you were dimming a switch on a lamp at home.
p427
aVAnd then, they will have the time, that will buy them the time,
p428
aVto be transported to the hospital
p429
aVto get the care they need.
p430
aVAnd then, after they get that care \u2014
p431
aVlike the mouse, like the skier,
p432
aVlike the 65-year-old woman \u2014
p433
aVthey'll wake up.
p434
aVA miracle?
p435
aVWe hope not, or maybe we just hope
p436
aVto make miracles a little more common.
p437
aa(lp438
VThank you very much.

VI get asked a lot what the difference between my work is
p5
aVand typical Pentagon long-range strategic planners.
p6
aVAnd the answer I like to offer is
p7
aVwhat they typically do is they think about the future of wars
p8
aVin the context of war.
p9
aVAnd what I've spent 15 years doing in this business \u2014
p10
aVand it's taken me almost 14 to figure it out \u2014
p11
aVis I think about the future of wars in the context of everything else.
p12
aVSo I tend to specialize on the scene between war and peace.
p13
aVThe material I'm going to show you is one idea from a book
p14
aVwith a lot of ideas.
p15
aVIt's the one that takes me around the world right now
p16
aVinteracting with foreign militaries quite a bit.
p17
aVThe material was generated in two years of work I did
p18
aVfor the Secretary of Defense,
p19
aVthinking about a new national grand strategy
p20
aVfor the United States.
p21
aVI'm going to present a problem
p22
aVand try to give you an answer.
p23
aa(lp24
VHere's my favorite bonehead concept from the 1990s in the Pentagon:
p25
aVthe theory of anti-access, area-denial asymmetrical strategies.
p26
aVWhy do we call it that?
p27
aVBecause it's got all those A's lined up I guess.
p28
aVThis is gobbledygook for
p29
aVif the United States fights somebody we're going to be huge.
p30
aVThey're going to be small.
p31
aVAnd if they try to fight us in the traditional, straight-up manner
p32
aVwe're going to kick their ass,
p33
aVwhich is why people don't try to do that any more.
p34
aVI met the last Air Force General who had actually
p35
aVshot down an enemy plane in combat.
p36
aVHe's now a one star General.
p37
aVThat's how distant we are from even meeting an air force
p38
aVwilling to fly against ours.
p39
aVSo that overmatched capability creates problems \u2014
p40
aVcatastrophic successes the White House calls them.
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd we're trying to figure that out,
p45
aVbecause it is an amazing capability.
p46
aVThe question is, what's the good you can do with it?
p47
aVOK?
p48
aVThe theory of anti-access, area-denial asymmetrical strategies \u2014
p49
aVgobbledygook that we sell to Congress,
p50
aVbecause if we just told them we can kick anybody's asses
p51
aVthey wouldn't buy us all the stuff we want.
p52
aVSo we say, area-denial, anti-access asymmetrical strategies
p53
aVand their eyes glaze over.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd they say, "Will you build it in my district?"
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
V(Applause)
p62
aa(lp63
VHere's my parody and it ain't much of one.
p64
aVLet's talk about a battle space.
p65
aVI don't know, Taiwan Straits 2025.
p66
aVLet's talk about an enemy embedded within that battle space.
p67
aVI don't know, the Million Man Swim.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VThe United States has to access that battle space instantaneously.
p72
aVThey throw up anti-access, area-denial asymmetrical strategies.
p73
aVA banana peel on the tarmac.
p74
aa(lp75
V(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VTrojan horses on our computer networks
p78
aVreveal all our Achilles' heels instantly.
p79
aVWe say, "China, it's yours."
p80
aVPrometheus approach, largely a geographic definition,
p81
aVfocuses almost exclusively on the start of conflict.
p82
aVWe field the first-half team in a league
p83
aVthat insists on keeping score until the end of the game.
p84
aVThat's the problem.
p85
aVWe can run the score up against anybody,
p86
aVand then get our asses kicked in the second half \u2014
p87
aVwhat they call fourth generation warfare.
p88
aa(lp89
VHere's the way I like to describe it instead.
p90
aVThere is no battle space the U.S. Military cannot access.
p91
aVThey said we couldn't do Afghanistan. We did it with ease.
p92
aVThey said we couldn't do Iraq.
p93
aVWe did it with 150 combat casualties in six weeks.
p94
aVWe did it so fast we weren't prepared for their collapse.
p95
aVThere is nobody we can't take down.
p96
aVThe question is, what do you do with the power?
p97
aa(lp98
VSo there's no trouble accessing battle spaces.
p99
aVWhat we have trouble accessing is the transition space
p100
aVthat must naturally follow,
p101
aVand creating the peace space that allows us to move on.
p102
aVProblem is, the Defense Department over here
p103
aVbeats the hell out of you.
p104
aVThe State Department over here says,
p105
aV"Come on boy, I know you can make it."
p106
aVAnd that poor country runs off that ledge,
p107
aVdoes that cartoon thing and then drops.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VThis is not about overwhelming force, but proportional force.
p112
aVIt's about non-lethal technologies,
p113
aVbecause if you fire real ammo into a crowd
p114
aVof women and children rioting
p115
aVyou're going to lose friends very quickly.
p116
aVThis is not about projecting power, but about staying power,
p117
aVwhich is about legitimacy with the locals.
p118
aVWho do you access in this transition space?
p119
aa(lp120
VYou have to create internal partners. You have to access coalition partners.
p121
aVWe asked the Indians for 17,000 peace keepers.
p122
aVI know their senior leadership, they wanted to give it to us.
p123
aVBut they said to us, "You know what?
p124
aVIn that transition space you're mostly hat not enough cattle.
p125
aVWe don't think you can pull it off,
p126
aVwe're not going to give you our 17,000 peace keepers for fodder."
p127
aVWe asked the Russians for 40,000.
p128
aVThey said no.
p129
aVI was in China in August, I said,
p130
aV"You should have 50,000 peace keepers in Iraq.
p131
aVIt's your oil, not ours."
p132
aVWhich is the truth. It's their oil.
p133
aVAnd the Chinese said to me, "Dr. Barnett, you're absolutely right.
p134
aVIn a perfect world we'd have 50,000 there.
p135
aVBut it's not a perfect world,
p136
aVand your administration isn't getting us any closer."
p137
aVBut we have trouble accessing our outcomes.
p138
aa(lp139
VWe lucked out, frankly, on the selection.
p140
aVWe face different opponents across these three.
p141
aVAnd it's time to start admitting
p142
aVyou can't ask the same 19-year-old to do it all, day in and day out.
p143
aVIt's just too damn hard.
p144
aVWe have an unparalleled capacity to wage war.
p145
aVWe don't do the everything else so well.
p146
aVFrankly, we do it better than anybody and we still suck at it.
p147
aVWe have a brilliant Secretary of War.
p148
aVWe don't have a Secretary of Everything Else.
p149
aVBecause if we did, that guy would be in front of the Senate,
p150
aVstill testifying over Abu Ghraib.
p151
aVThe problem is he doesn't exist.
p152
aVThere is no Secretary of Everything Else.
p153
aVI think we have an unparalleled capacity to wage war.
p154
aVI call that the Leviathan Force.
p155
aVWhat we need to build is a force for the Everything Else.
p156
aVI call them the System Administrators.
p157
aa(lp158
VWhat I think this really represents
p159
aVis lack of an A to Z rule set for the world as a whole
p160
aVfor processing politically bankrupt states.
p161
aVWe have one for processing economically bankrupt states.
p162
aVIt's the IMF Sovereign Bankruptcy Plan, OK?
p163
aVWe argue about it every time we use it.
p164
aVArgentina just went through it, broke a lot of rules.
p165
aVThey got out on the far end, we said, "Fine, don't worry about it."
p166
aVIt's transparent. A certain amount of certainty
p167
aVgives the sense of a non-zero outcome.
p168
aVWe don't have one for processing politically bankrupt states
p169
aVthat, frankly, everybody wants gone.
p170
aVLike Saddam, like Mugabe, like Kim Jong-Il \u2014
p171
aVpeople who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions.
p172
aVLike the 250,000 dead so far in Sudan.
p173
aa(lp174
VWhat would an A to Z system look like?
p175
aVI'm going to distinguish between what I call
p176
aVfront half and back half.
p177
aVAnd let's call this red line, I don't know, mission accomplished.
p178
aa(lp179
V(Laughter)
p180
aa(lp181
V(Applause)
p182
aa(lp183
VWhat we have extant right now,
p184
aVat the beginning of this system, is the U.N. Security Council as a grand jury.
p185
aVWhat can they do?
p186
aVThey can indict your ass.
p187
aVThey can debate it. They can write it on a piece of paper.
p188
aVThey can put it in an envelope and mail it to you,
p189
aVand then say in no uncertain terms, "Please cut that out."
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
VThat gets you about four million dead in Central Africa over the 1990s.
p194
aVThat gets you 250,000 dead in the Sudan in the last 15 months.
p195
aVEverybody's got to answer their grandchildren some day
p196
aVwhat you did about the holocaust in Africa,
p197
aVand you better have an answer.
p198
aVWe don't have anything to translate that will into action.
p199
aa(lp200
VWhat we do have is the U.S.-enabled Leviathan Force that says,
p201
aV"You want me to take that guy down? I'll take that guy down.
p202
aVI'll do it on Tuesday. It will cost you 20 billion dollars."
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VBut here's the deal.
p207
aVAs soon as I can't find anybody else to air out,
p208
aVI leave the scene immediately.
p209
aVThat's called the Powell Doctrine.
p210
aVWay downstream we have the International Criminal Court.
p211
aVThey love to put them on trial. They've got Milosevi\u0107 right now.
p212
aa(lp213
VWhat are we missing?
p214
aVA functioning executive that will translate will into action,
p215
aVbecause we don't have it.
p216
aVEvery time we lead one of these efforts
p217
aVwe have to whip ourselves into this imminent threat thing.
p218
aVWe haven't faced an imminent threat since
p219
aVthe Cuban missile crisis in 1962.
p220
aVBut we use this language from a bygone era
p221
aVto scare ourselves into doing something
p222
aVbecause we're a democracy and that's what it takes.
p223
aVAnd if that doesn't work we scream, "He's got a gun!"
p224
aVjust as we rush in.
p225
aa(lp226
V(Laughter)
p227
aa(lp228
VAnd then we look over the body
p229
aVand we find an old cigarette lighter and we say,
p230
aV"Jesus, it was dark."
p231
aa(lp232
V(Laughter)
p233
aa(lp234
VDo you want to do it, France?
p235
aVFrance says, "No, but I do like to criticize you after the fact."
p236
aa(lp237
VWhat we need downstream is a great power enabled \u2014
p238
aVwhat I call that Sys Admin Force.
p239
aVWe should have had 250,000 troops streaming into Iraq
p240
aVon the heels of that Leviathan sweeping towards Baghdad.
p241
aVWhat do you get then?
p242
aVNo looting, no military disappearing,
p243
aVno arms disappearing, no ammo disappearing,
p244
aVno Muqtada Al-Sadr \u2014 I'm wrecking his bones \u2014
p245
aVno insurgency.
p246
aVTalk to anybody who was over there in the first six months.
p247
aVWe had six months to feel the lob, to get the job done,
p248
aVand we dicked around for six months.
p249
aVAnd then they turned on us.
p250
aVWhy? Because they just got fed up.
p251
aVThey saw what we did to Saddam.
p252
aVThey said, "You're that powerful, you can resurrect this country.
p253
aVYou're America."
p254
aa(lp255
VWhat we need is an international reconstruction fund \u2014
p256
aVSebastian Mallaby, Washington Post, great idea.
p257
aVModel on the IMF.
p258
aVInstead of passing the hat each time, OK?
p259
aVWhere are we going to find this guy? G20, that's easy.
p260
aVCheck out their agenda since 9/11.
p261
aVAll security dominated.
p262
aVThey're going to decide up front how the money gets spent
p263
aVjust like in the IMF.
p264
aVYou vote according to how much money you put in the kitty.
p265
aVHere's my challenge to the Defense Department.
p266
aVYou've got to build this force. You've got to seed this force.
p267
aVYou've got to track coalition partners. Create a record of success.
p268
aVYou will get this model.
p269
aVYou tell me it's too hard to do.
p270
aVI'll walk this dog right through that six part series on the Balkans.
p271
aVWe did it just like that.
p272
aVI'm talking about regularizing it, making it transparent.
p273
aVWould you like Mugabe gone?
p274
aVWould you like Kim Jong-Il, who's killed about two million people,
p275
aVwould you like him gone?
p276
aVWould you like a better system?
p277
aVThis is why it matters to the military.
p278
aVThey've been experiencing an identity crisis since the end of the Cold War.
p279
aVI'm not talking about the difference between reality and desire,
p280
aVwhich I can do because I'm not inside the beltway.
p281
aa(lp282
V(Laughter)
p283
aa(lp284
VI'm talking about the 1990s.
p285
aVThe Berlin Wall falls. We do Desert Storm.
p286
aVThe split starts to emerge between those in the military
p287
aVwho see a future they can live with,
p288
aVand those who see a future that starts to scare them,
p289
aVlike the U.S. submarine community,
p290
aVwhich watches the Soviet Navy disappear overnight.
p291
aVAh!
p292
aa(lp293
V(Laughter)
p294
aa(lp295
VSo they start moving from reality towards desire
p296
aVand they create their own special language
p297
aVto describe their voyage of self-discovery and self-actualization.
p298
aa(lp299
V(Laughter)
p300
aa(lp301
VThe problem is you need a big, sexy opponent to fight against.
p302
aVAnd if you can't find one you've got to make one up.
p303
aVChina, all grown up, going to be a looker!
p304
aa(lp305
V(Laughter)
p306
aa(lp307
VThe rest of the military got dragged down into the muck
p308
aVacross the 1990s
p309
aVand they developed this very derisive term to describe it:
p310
aVmilitary operations other than war.
p311
aVI ask you, who joins the military to do things other than war?
p312
aVActually, most of them.
p313
aVJessica Lynch never planned on shooting back.
p314
aVMost of them don't pick up a rifle.
p315
aVI maintain this is code inside the Army for,
p316
aV"We don't want to do this."
p317
aVThey spent the 1990s working the messy scene
p318
aVbetween globalized parts of the world
p319
aVWhat I call the core and the gap.
p320
aVThe Clinton administration wasn't interested in running this.
p321
aVFor eight years, after screwing up the relationship on day one \u2014
p322
aVinauguration day with gays in the military \u2014
p323
aVwhich was deft.
p324
aa(lp325
V(Laughter)
p326
aa(lp327
VSo we were home alone for eight years.
p328
aVAnd what did we do home alone?
p329
aVWe bought one military and we operated another.
p330
aVIt's like the guy who goes to the doctor and says,
p331
aV"Doctor, it hurts when I do this."
p332
aa(lp333
V(Laughter)
p334
aa(lp335
VThe doctor says, "Stop doing that you idiot."
p336
aa(lp337
VI used to give this brief inside the Pentagon in the early 1990s.
p338
aVI'd say, "You're buying one military and you're operating another,
p339
aVand eventually it's going to hurt. It's wrong.
p340
aVBad Pentagon, bad!"
p341
aa(lp342
V(Laughter)
p343
aa(lp344
VAnd they'd say, "Dr. Barnett, you are so right.
p345
aVCan you come back next year and remind us again?"
p346
aa(lp347
V(Laughter)
p348
aa(lp349
VSome people say 9/11 heals the rift \u2014
p350
aVjerks the long-term transformation gurus
p351
aVout of their 30,000 foot view of history,
p352
aVdrags them down in to the muck and says, "You want a networked opponent?
p353
aVI've got one, he's everywhere, go find him."
p354
aVIt elevates MOOTW \u2014 how we pronounce that acronym \u2014
p355
aVfrom crap to grand strategy,
p356
aVbecause that's how you're going to shrink that gap.
p357
aa(lp358
VSome people put these two things together
p359
aVand they call it empire, which I think is a boneheaded concept.
p360
aVEmpire is about the enforcement of not just minimal rule sets,
p361
aVwhich you cannot do,
p362
aVbut maximum rule sets which you must do.
p363
aVIt's not our system of governance.
p364
aVNever how we've sought to interact with the outside world.
p365
aVI prefer that phrase System Administration.
p366
aVWe enforce the minimal rule sets
p367
aVfor maintaining connectivity to the global economy.
p368
aVCertain bad things you cannot do.
p369
aVHow this impacts the way we think about the future of war.
p370
aVThis is a concept which gets me vilified throughout the Pentagon.
p371
aVIt makes me very popular as well.
p372
aVEverybody's got an opinion.
p373
aa(lp374
VGoing back to the beginning of our country \u2014
p375
aVhistorically, defenses meant protection of the homeland.
p376
aVSecurity has meant everything else.
p377
aVWritten into our constitution,
p378
aVtwo different forces, two different functions.
p379
aVRaise an army when you need it,
p380
aVand maintain a navy for day-to-day connectivity.
p381
aVA Department of War, a Department of Everything Else.
p382
aVA big stick, a baton stick.
p383
aVCan of whup ass,
p384
aVthe networking force.
p385
aVIn 1947 we merged these two things together
p386
aVin the Defense Department.
p387
aVOur long-term rationale becomes,
p388
aVwe're involved in a hair trigger stand off with the Soviets.
p389
aVTo attack America is to risk blowing up the world.
p390
aVWe connected national security to international security
p391
aVwith about a seven minute time delay.
p392
aVThat's not our problem now.
p393
aVThey can kill three million in Chicago tomorrow
p394
aVand we don't go to the mattresses with nukes.
p395
aVThat's the scary part.
p396
aa(lp397
VThe question is how do we reconnect American national security
p398
aVwith global security to make the world a lot more comfortable,
p399
aVand to embed and contextualize our employment
p400
aVof force around the planet?
p401
aVWhat's happened since is that bifurcation I described.
p402
aVWe talked about this going all the way back
p403
aVto the end of the Cold War.
p404
aVLet's have a Department of War, and a Department of Something Else.
p405
aVSome people say, "Hell, 9/11 did it for you."
p406
aVNow we've got a home game and an away game.
p407
aa(lp408
V(Laughter)
p409
aa(lp410
VThe Department of Homeland Security is a strategic feel good measure.
p411
aVIt's going to be the Department of Agriculture for the 21st century.
p412
aVTSA \u2014 thousands standing around.
p413
aa(lp414
V(Laughter)
p415
aa(lp416
VI supported the war in Iraq.
p417
aVHe was a bad guy with multiple priors.
p418
aVIt's not like we had to find him
p419
aVactually killing somebody live to arrest him.
p420
aVI knew we'd kick ass in the war with the Leviathan Force.
p421
aVI knew we'd have a hard time with what followed.
p422
aVBut I know this organization doesn't change until it experiences failure.
p423
aVWhat do I mean by these two different forces?
p424
aa(lp425
VThis is the Hobbesian Force.
p426
aVI love this force. I don't want to see it go.
p427
aVThat plus nukes rules out great power war.
p428
aVThis is the military the rest of the world wants us to build.
p429
aVIt's why I travel all over the world talking to foreign militaries.
p430
aa(lp431
VWhat does this mean?
p432
aVIt means you've got to stop pretending
p433
aVyou can do these two very disparate skill sets with the same 19-year-old.
p434
aVSwitching back, morning, afternoon, evening,
p435
aVmorning, afternoon, evening.
p436
aVHanding out aid, shooting back,
p437
aVhanding out aid, shooting back.
p438
aVIt's too much.
p439
aVThe 19-year-olds get tired from the switching, OK?
p440
aa(lp441
V(Laughter)
p442
aa(lp443
VThat force on the left, you can train a 19-year-old to do that.
p444
aVThat force on the right is more like a 40-year-old cop.
p445
aVYou need the experience.
p446
aVWhat does this mean in terms of operations?
p447
aa(lp448
VThe rule is going to be this.
p449
aVThat Sys Admin force is the force that never comes home,
p450
aVdoes most of your work.
p451
aVYou break out that Leviathan Force only every so often.
p452
aVBut here's the promise you make to the American public,
p453
aVto your own people, to the world.
p454
aVYou break out that Leviathan Force,
p455
aVyou promise, you guarantee that you're going to mount
p456
aVone hell of a \u2014 immediately \u2014 follow-on Sys Admin effort.
p457
aVDon't plan for the war unless you plan to win the peace.
p458
aa(lp459
V(Applause)

aa(lp461
VOther differences. Leviathan

p463
aVand their former colonies.
p464
aa(lp465
V(Laughter)
p466
aa(lp467
VIncluding us, I would remind you.
p468
aVThe rest \u2014 wider array of partners.
p469
aVInternational organizations, non-governmental organizations,
p470
aVprivate voluntary organizations, contractors.
p471
aVYou're not going to get away from that.
p472
aVLeviathan Force, it's all about joint operations between the military services.
p473
aVWe're done with that.
p474
aVWhat we need to do is inter-agency operations,
p475
aVwhich frankly Condi Rice was in charge of.
p476
aVAnd I'm amazed nobody asked her that question when she was confirmed.
p477
aa(lp478
VI call the Leviathan Force your dad's military.
p479
aVI like them young, male, unmarried, slightly pissed off.
p480
aa(lp481
V(Laughter)
p482
aa(lp483
VI call the Sys Admin Force your mom's military.
p484
aVIt's everything the man's military hates.
p485
aVGender balanced much more, older, educated, married with children.
p486
aVThe force on the left, up or out.
p487
aVThe force on the right, in and out.
p488
aVThe force on the left respects Posse Comitatus restrictions
p489
aVon the use of force inside the U.S.
p490
aVThe force on the right's going to obliterate it.
p491
aVThat's where the National Guard's going to be.
p492
aVThe force on the left is never coming under the purview
p493
aVof the International Criminal Court.
p494
aVSys Admin Force has to.
p495
aVDifferent definitions of network centricity.
p496
aVOne takes down networks, one puts them up.
p497
aVAnd you've got to wage war here in such a way to facilitate that.
p498
aa(lp499
VDo we need a bigger budget?
p500
aVDo we need a draft to pull this off?
p501
aVAbsolutely not.
p502
aVI've been told by the Revolution of Military Affairs crowd for years,
p503
aVwe can do it faster, cheaper, smaller, just as lethal.
p504
aVI say, "Great, I'm going to take the Sys Admin budget out of your hide."
p505
aa(lp506
VHere's the larger point.
p507
aVYou're going to build the Sys Admin Force inside the U.S. Military first.
p508
aVBut ultimately you're going to civilianize it, probably two thirds.
p509
aVInter agency-ize it, internationalize it.
p510
aVSo yes, it begins inside the Pentagon,
p511
aVbut over time it's going to cross that river.
p512
aa(lp513
V(Laughter)
p514
aa(lp515
VI have been to the mountain top. I can see the future.
p516
aVI may not live long enough to get you there, but it's going to happen.
p517
aVWe're going to have a Department of Something Else
p518
aVbetween war and peace.
p519
aa(lp520
VLast slide.
p521
aVWho gets custody of the kids?
p522
aVThis is where the Marines in the audience get kind of tense.
p523
aV(Laughter)
p524
aVAnd this is when they think about beating the crap out of me
p525
aVafter the talk.
p526
aa(lp527
V(Laughter)
p528
aa(lp529
VRead Max Boon.
p530
aVThis is the history of the marines \u2014 small wars, small arms.
p531
aVThe Marines are like my West Highland Terrier.
p532
aVThey get up every morning, they want to dig a hole
p533
aVand they want to kill something.
p534
aa(lp535
V(Laughter)
p536
aa(lp537
VI don't want my Marines handing out aid.
p538
aVI want them to be Marines.
p539
aVThat's what keeps the Sys Admin Force from being a pussy force.
p540
aVIt keeps it from being the U.N.
p541
aVYou shoot at these people the Marines are going to come over and kill you.
p542
aa(lp543
V(Laughter)
p544
aa(lp545
V(Applause)
p546
aa(lp547
VDepartment of Navy, strategic subs go this way,
p548
aVsurface combatants are over there,
p549
aVand the news is they may actually be that small.
p550
aa(lp551
V(Laughter)
p552
aa(lp553
VI call it the Smart Dust Navy.
p554
aVI tell young officers, "You may command 500 ships in your career.
p555
aVBad news is they may not have anybody on them."
p556
aVCarriers go both ways because they're a swing asset.
p557
aVYou'll see the pattern \u2014 airborne, just like carriers.
p558
aVArmor goes this way.
p559
aVHere's the dirty secret of the Air Force,
p560
aVyou can win by bombing.
p561
aVBut you need lots of these guys on the ground to win the peace.
p562
aVShinseki was right with the argument.
p563
aVAir force, strategic airlift goes both ways.
p564
aVBombers, fighters go over here.
p565
aVSpecial Operations Command down at Tampa.
p566
aVTrigger-pullers go this way.
p567
aVCivil Affairs, that bastard child, comes over here.
p568
aVReturn to the Army.
p569
aVThe point about the trigger-pullers and Special Operations Command.
p570
aVNo off season, these guys are always active.
p571
aVThey drop in, do their business, disappear.
p572
aVSee me now. Don't talk about it later.
p573
aa(lp574
V(Laughter)
p575
aa(lp576
VI was never here.
p577
aa(lp578
V(Laughter)
p579
aa(lp580
VThe world is my playground.
p581
aa(lp582
V(Laughter)
p583
aa(lp584
VI want to keep trigger-pullers trigger-happy.
p585
aVI want the rules to be as loose as possible.
p586
aVBecause when the thing gets prevented in Chicago
p587
aVwith the three million dead
p588
aVthat perverts our political system beyond all recognition,
p589
aVthese are the guys who are going to kill them first.
p590
aVSo it's better off to have them make some mistakes along the way
p591
aVthan to see that.
p592
aa(lp593
VReserve component \u2014
p594
aVNational Guard reserves overwhelmingly Sys Admin.
p595
aVHow are you going to get them to work for this force?
p596
aVMost firemen in this country do it for free.
p597
aVThis is not about money.
p598
aVThis is about being up front with these guys and gals.
p599
aa(lp600
VLast point, intelligence community \u2014
p601
aVthe muscle and the defense agencies go this way.
p602
aVWhat should be the CIA, open, analytical, open source
p603
aVshould come over here.
p604
aVThe information you need to do this is not secret.
p605
aVIt's not secret.
p606
aVRead that great piece in the New Yorker
p607
aVabout how our echo boomers, 19 to 25, over in Iraq
p608
aVtaught each other how to do Sys Admin work,
p609
aVover the Internet in chat rooms.
p610
aVThey said, "Al Qaeda could be listening."
p611
aVThey said, "Well, Jesus, they already know this stuff."
p612
aa(lp613
V(Laughter)
p614
aa(lp615
VTake a gift in the left hand.
p616
aVThese are the sunglasses that don't scare people, simple stuff.
p617
aVCensors and transparency, the overheads go in both directions.
p618
aa(lp619
VThanks.

During the tumultuous period from November 2001 to June 2003, he advised the Pentagon on <strong>transforming military capabilities</strong> to meet future threats. He led the five-year <a href=\\"http://www.thomaspmbarnett.com/projects/newrulesset/nrs_index.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">NewRuleSet.Project</a>, which studied how globalization is transforming warfare.

During the tumultuous period from November 2001 to June 2003, he advised the Pentagon on <strong>transforming military capabilities</strong> to meet future threats. He led the five-year <a href=\\"http://www.thomaspmbarnett.com/projects/newrulesset/nrs_index.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">NewRuleSet.Project</a>, which studied how globalization is transforming warfare.

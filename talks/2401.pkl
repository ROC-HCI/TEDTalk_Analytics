VLate in January 1975,
p5
aVa 17-year-old German girl called Vera Brandes
p6
aVwalked out onto the stage of the Cologne Opera House.
p7
aVThe auditorium was empty.
p8
aVIt was lit only by the dim, green glow of the emergency exit sign.
p9
aVThis was the most exciting day of Vera's life.
p10
aVShe was the youngest concert promoter in Germany,
p11
aVand she had persuaded the Cologne Opera House
p12
aVto host a late-night concert of jazz
p13
aVfrom the American musician, Keith Jarrett.
p14
aV1,400 people were coming.
p15
aVAnd in just a few hours,
p16
aVJarrett would walk out on the same stage,
p17
aVhe'd sit down at the piano
p18
aVand without rehearsal or sheet music,
p19
aVhe would begin to play.
p20
aa(lp21
VBut right now,
p22
aVVera was introducing Keith to the piano in question,
p23
aVand it wasn't going well.
p24
aVJarrett looked to the instrument a little warily,
p25
aVplayed a few notes,
p26
aVwalked around it,
p27
aVplayed a few more notes,
p28
aVmuttered something to his producer.
p29
aVThen the producer came over to Vera and said ...
p30
aV"If you don't get a new piano, Keith can't play."
p31
aa(lp32
VThere'd been a mistake.
p33
aVThe opera house had provided the wrong instrument.
p34
aVThis one had this harsh, tinny upper register,
p35
aVbecause all the felt had worn away.
p36
aVThe black notes were sticking,
p37
aVthe white notes were out of tune,
p38
aVthe pedals didn't work
p39
aVand the piano itself was just too small.
p40
aVIt wouldn't create the volume
p41
aVthat would fill a large space such as the Cologne Opera House.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo Keith Jarrett left.
p44
aVHe went and sat outside in his car,
p45
aVleaving Vera Brandes
p46
aVto get on the phone to try to find a replacement piano.
p47
aVNow she got a piano tuner,
p48
aVbut she couldn't get a new piano.
p49
aVAnd so she went outside
p50
aVand she stood there in the rain,
p51
aVtalking to Keith Jarrett,
p52
aVbegging him not to cancel the concert.
p53
aVAnd he looked out of his car
p54
aVat this bedraggled, rain-drenched German teenager,
p55
aVtook pity on her,
p56
aVand said,
p57
aV"Never forget ... only for you."
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd so a few hours later,
p60
aVJarrett did indeed step out onto the stage of the opera house,
p61
aVhe sat down at the unplayable piano
p62
aVand began.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Music)
p65
aa(lp66
VWithin moments it became clear that something magical was happening.
p67
aVJarrett was avoiding those upper registers,
p68
aVhe was sticking to the middle tones of the keyboard,
p69
aVwhich gave the piece a soothing, ambient quality.
p70
aVBut also, because the piano was so quiet,
p71
aVhe had to set up these rumbling, repetitive riffs in the bass.
p72
aVAnd he stood up twisting, pounding down on the keys,
p73
aVdesperately trying to create enough volume to reach the people in the back row.
p74
aa(lp75
VIt's an electrifying performance.
p76
aVIt somehow has this peaceful quality,
p77
aVand at the same time it's full of energy,
p78
aVit's dynamic.
p79
aVAnd the audience loved it.
p80
aVAudiences continue to love it
p81
aVbecause the recording of the Köln Concert
p82
aVis the best-selling piano album in history
p83
aVand the best-selling solo jazz album in history.
p84
aa(lp85
VKeith Jarrett had been handed a mess.
p86
aVHe had embraced that mess, and it soared.
p87
aVBut let's think for a moment about Jarrett's initial instinct.
p88
aVHe didn't want to play.
p89
aVOf course,
p90
aVI think any of us, in any remotely similar situation,
p91
aVwould feel the same way, we'd have the same instinct.
p92
aVWe don't want to be asked to do good work with bad tools.
p93
aVWe don't want to have to overcome unnecessary hurdles.
p94
aVBut Jarrett's instinct was wrong,
p95
aVand thank goodness he changed his mind.
p96
aVAnd I think our instinct is also wrong.
p97
aVI think we need to gain a bit more appreciation
p98
aVfor the unexpected advantages of having to cope with a little mess.
p99
aVSo let me give you some examples
p100
aVfrom cognitive psychology,
p101
aVfrom complexity science,
p102
aVfrom social psychology,
p103
aVand of course, rock 'n' roll.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo cognitive psychology first.
p106
aVWe've actually known for a while
p107
aVthat certain kinds of difficulty,
p108
aVcertain kinds of obstacle,
p109
aVcan actually improve our performance.
p110
aVFor example,
p111
aVthe psychologist Daniel Oppenheimer,
p112
aVa few years ago,
p113
aVteamed up with high school teachers.
p114
aVAnd he asked them to reformat the handouts
p115
aVthat they were giving to some of their classes.
p116
aVSo the regular handout would be formatted in something straightforward,
p117
aVsuch as Helvetica or Times New Roman.
p118
aVBut half these classes were getting handouts that were formatted
p119
aVin something sort of intense, like Haettenschweiler,
p120
aVor something with a zesty bounce, like Comic Sans italicized.
p121
aVNow, these are really ugly fonts,
p122
aVand they're difficult fonts to read.
p123
aVBut at the end of the semester,
p124
aVstudents were given exams,
p125
aVand the students who'd been asked to read the more difficult fonts,
p126
aVhad actually done better on their exams,
p127
aVin a variety of subjects.
p128
aVAnd the reason is,
p129
aVthe difficult font had slowed them down,
p130
aVforced them to work a bit harder,
p131
aVto think a bit more about what they were reading,
p132
aVto interpret it ...
p133
aVand so they learned more.
p134
aa(lp135
VAnother example.
p136
aVThe psychologist Shelley Carson has been testing Harvard undergraduates
p137
aVfor the quality of their attentional filters.
p138
aVWhat do I mean by that?
p139
aVWhat I mean is, imagine you're in a restaurant,
p140
aVyou're having a conversation,
p141
aVthere are all kinds of other conversations going on in the restaurant,
p142
aVyou want to filter them out,
p143
aVyou want to focus on what's important to you.
p144
aVCan you do that?
p145
aVIf you can, you have good, strong attentional filters.
p146
aVBut some people really struggle with that.
p147
aVSome of Carson's undergraduate subjects struggled with that.
p148
aVThey had weak filters, they had porous filters \u2014
p149
aVlet a lot of external information in.
p150
aVAnd so what that meant is they were constantly being interrupted
p151
aVby the sights and the sounds of the world around them.
p152
aVIf there was a television on while they were doing their essays,
p153
aVthey couldn't screen it out.
p154
aa(lp155
VNow, you would think that that was a disadvantage ...
p156
aVbut no.
p157
aVWhen Carson looked at what these students had achieved,
p158
aVthe ones with the weak filters
p159
aVwere vastly more likely
p160
aVto have some real creative milestone in their lives,
p161
aVto have published their first novel,
p162
aVto have released their first album.
p163
aVThese distractions were actually grists to their creative mill.
p164
aVThey were able to think outside the box because their box was full of holes.
p165
aa(lp166
VLet's talk about complexity science.
p167
aVSo how do you solve a really complex \u2014
p168
aVthe world's full of complicated problems \u2014
p169
aVhow do you solve a really complicated problem?
p170
aa(lp171
VFor example, you try to make a jet engine.
p172
aVThere are lots and lots of different variables,
p173
aVthe operating temperature, the materials,
p174
aVall the different dimensions, the shape.
p175
aVYou can't solve that kind of problem all in one go,
p176
aVit's too hard.
p177
aVSo what do you do?
p178
aVWell, one thing you can do is try to solve it step-by-step.
p179
aVSo you have some kind of prototype
p180
aVand you tweak it, you test it, you improve it.
p181
aVYou tweak it, you test it, you improve it.
p182
aVNow, this idea of marginal gains will eventually get you a good jet engine.
p183
aVAnd it's been quite widely implemented in the world.
p184
aVSo you'll hear about it, for example, in high performance cycling,
p185
aVweb designers will talk about trying to optimize their web pages,
p186
aVthey're looking for these step-by-step gains.
p187
aa(lp188
VThat's a good way to solve a complicated problem.
p189
aVBut you know what would make it a better way?
p190
aVA dash of mess.
p191
aVYou add randomness,
p192
aVearly on in the process,
p193
aVyou make crazy moves,
p194
aVyou try stupid things that shouldn't work,
p195
aVand that will tend to make the problem-solving work better.
p196
aVAnd the reason for that is
p197
aVthe trouble with the step-by-step process,
p198
aVthe marginal gains,
p199
aVis they can walk you gradually down a dead end.
p200
aVAnd if you start with the randomness, that becomes less likely,
p201
aVand your problem-solving becomes more robust.
p202
aa(lp203
VLet's talk about social psychology.
p204
aVSo the psychologist Katherine Phillips, with some colleagues,
p205
aVrecently gave murder mystery problems to some students,
p206
aVand these students were collected in groups of four
p207
aVand they were given dossiers with information about a crime \u2014
p208
aValibis and evidence, witness statements and three suspects.
p209
aVAnd the groups of four students were asked to figure out who did it,
p210
aVwho committed the crime.
p211
aVAnd there were two treatments in this experiment.
p212
aVIn some cases these were four friends,
p213
aVthey all knew each other well.
p214
aVIn other cases,
p215
aVthree friends and a stranger.
p216
aVAnd you can see where I'm going with this.
p217
aa(lp218
VObviously I'm going to say
p219
aVthat the groups with the stranger solved the problem more effectively,
p220
aVwhich is true, they did.
p221
aVActually, they solved the problem quite a lot more effectively.
p222
aVSo the groups of four friends,
p223
aVthey only had a 50-50 chance of getting the answer right.
p224
aVWhich is actually not that great \u2014
p225
aVin multiple choice, for three answers? 50-50's not good.
p226
aa(lp227
V(Laughter)
p228
aa(lp229
VThe three friends and the stranger,
p230
aVeven though the stranger didn't have any extra information,
p231
aVeven though it was just a case
p232
aVof how that changed the conversation to accommodate that awkwardness,
p233
aVthe three friends and the stranger,
p234
aVthey had a 75 percent chance of finding the right answer.
p235
aVThat's quite a big leap in performance.
p236
aa(lp237
VBut I think what's really interesting
p238
aVis not just that the three friends and the stranger did a better job,
p239
aVbut how they felt about it.
p240
aVSo when Katherine Phillips interviewed the groups of four friends,
p241
aVthey had a nice time,
p242
aVthey also thought they'd done a good job.
p243
aVThey were complacent.
p244
aVWhen she spoke to the three friends and the stranger,
p245
aVthey had not had a nice time \u2014
p246
aVit's actually rather difficult, it's rather awkward ...
p247
aVand they were full of doubt.
p248
aVThey didn't think they'd done a good job even though they had.
p249
aVAnd I think that really exemplifies
p250
aVthe challenge that we're dealing with here.
p251
aa(lp252
VBecause, yeah \u2014
p253
aVthe ugly font,
p254
aVthe awkward stranger,
p255
aVthe random move ...
p256
aVthese disruptions help us solve problems,
p257
aVthey help us become more creative.
p258
aVBut we don't feel that they're helping us.
p259
aVWe feel that they're getting in the way ...
p260
aVand so we resist.
p261
aVAnd that's why the last example is really important.
p262
aa(lp263
VSo I want to talk about somebody
p264
aVfrom the background of the world of rock 'n' roll.
p265
aVAnd you may know him, he's actually a TED-ster.
p266
aVHis name is Brian Eno.
p267
aVHe is an ambient composer \u2014 rather brilliant.
p268
aa(lp269
VHe's also a kind of catalyst
p270
aVbehind some of the great rock 'n' roll albums of the last 40 years.
p271
aVHe's worked with David Bowie on "Heroes,"
p272
aVhe worked with U2 on "Achtung Baby" and "The Joshua Tree,"
p273
aVhe's worked with DEVO,
p274
aVhe's worked with Coldplay, he's worked with everybody.
p275
aa(lp276
VAnd what does he do to make these great rock bands better?
p277
aVWell, he makes a mess.
p278
aVHe disrupts their creative processes.
p279
aVIt's his role to be the awkward stranger.
p280
aVIt's his role to tell them
p281
aVthat they have to play the unplayable piano.
p282
aa(lp283
VAnd one of the ways in which he creates this disruption
p284
aVis through this remarkable deck of cards \u2014
p285
aVI have my signed copy here \u2014 thank you, Brian.
p286
aVThey're called The Oblique Strategies,
p287
aVhe developed them with a friend of his.
p288
aVAnd when they're stuck in the studio,
p289
aVBrian Eno will reach for one of the cards.
p290
aVHe'll draw one at random,
p291
aVand he'll make the band follow the instructions on the card.
p292
aa(lp293
VSo this one ...
p294
aV"Change instrument roles."
p295
aVYeah, everyone swap instruments \u2014 Drummer on the piano \u2014
p296
aVBrilliant, brilliant idea.
p297
aa(lp298
V"Look closely at the most  embarrassing details. Amplify them."
p299
aa(lp300
V"Make a sudden, destructive, unpredictable action. Incorporate."
p301
aa(lp302
VThese cards are disruptive.
p303
aa(lp304
VNow, they've proved their worth in album after album.
p305
aVThe musicians hate them.
p306
aa(lp307
V(Laughter)
p308
aa(lp309
VSo Phil Collins was playing drums on an early Brian Eno album.
p310
aVHe got so frustrated he started throwing beer cans across the studio.
p311
aa(lp312
VCarlos Alomar, great rock guitarist,
p313
aVworking with Eno on David Bowie's "Lodger" album,
p314
aVand at one point he turns to Brian and says,
p315
aV"Brian, this experiment is stupid."
p316
aVBut the thing is it was a pretty good album,
p317
aVbut also,
p318
aVCarlos Alomar, 35 years later, now uses The Oblique Strategies.
p319
aVAnd he tells his students to use The Oblique Strategies
p320
aVbecause he's realized something.
p321
aVJust because you don't like it doesn't mean it isn't helping you.
p322
aa(lp323
VThe strategies actually weren't a deck of cards originally,
p324
aVthey were just a list \u2014
p325
aVlist on the recording studio wall.
p326
aVA checklist of things you might try if you got stuck.
p327
aa(lp328
VThe list didn't work.
p329
aVKnow why?
p330
aVNot messy enough.
p331
aVYour eye would go down the list
p332
aVand it would settle on whatever was the least disruptive,
p333
aVthe least troublesome,
p334
aVwhich of course misses the point entirely.
p335
aa(lp336
VAnd what Brian Eno came to realize was,
p337
aVyes, we need to run the stupid experiments,
p338
aVwe need to deal with the awkward strangers,
p339
aVwe need to try to read the ugly fonts.
p340
aVThese things help us.
p341
aVThey help us solve problems,
p342
aVthey help us be more creative.
p343
aa(lp344
VBut also ...
p345
aVwe really need some persuasion if we're going to accept this.
p346
aVSo however we do it ...
p347
aVwhether it's sheer willpower,
p348
aVwhether it's the flip of a card
p349
aVor whether it's a guilt trip from a German teenager,
p350
aVall of us, from time to time,
p351
aVneed to sit down and try and play the unplayable piano.
p352
aa(lp353
VThank you.
p354

VFor much of the past century,
p5
aVarchitecture was under the spell of a famous doctrine.
p6
aV"Form follows function" had become modernity's ambitious manifesto
p7
aVand detrimental straitjacket,
p8
aVas it liberated architecture from the decorative,
p9
aVbut condemned it to utilitarian rigor and restrained purpose.
p10
aVOf course, architecture is about function,
p11
aVbut I want to remember a rewriting of this phrase by Bernard Tschumi,
p12
aVand I want to propose a completely different quality.
p13
aVIf form follows fiction,
p14
aVwe could think of architecture and buildings as a space of stories \u2014
p15
aVstories of the people that live there,
p16
aVof the people that work in these buildings.
p17
aVAnd we could start to imagine the experiences our buildings create.
p18
aa(lp19
VIn this sense, I'm interested in fiction
p20
aVnot as the implausible but as the real,
p21
aVas the reality of what architecture means
p22
aVfor the people that live in it and with it.
p23
aVOur buildings are prototypes, ideas for how the space of living
p24
aVor how the space of working could be different,
p25
aVand what a space of culture or a space of media could look like today.
p26
aVOur buildings are real; they're being built.
p27
aVThey're an explicit engagement in physical reality
p28
aVand conceptual possibility.
p29
aVI think of our architecture as organizational structures.
p30
aVAt their core is indeed structural thinking, like a system:
p31
aVHow can we arrange things in both a functional
p32
aVand experiential way?
p33
aVHow can we create structures that generate a series
p34
aVof relationships and narratives?
p35
aVAnd how can fictive stories
p36
aVof the inhabitants and users of our buildings
p37
aVscript the architecture,
p38
aVwhile the architecture scripts those stories at the same time?
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd here comes the second term into play,
p41
aVwhat I call "narrative hybrids" \u2014
p42
aVstructures of multiple simultaneous stories
p43
aVthat unfold throughout the buildings we create.
p44
aVSo we could think of architecture as complex systems of relationships,
p45
aVboth in a programmatic and functional way
p46
aVand in an experiential and emotive or social way.
p47
aa(lp48
VThis is the headquarters for China's national broadcaster,
p49
aVwhich I designed together with Rem Koolhaas at OMA.
p50
aVWhen I first arrived in Beijing in 2002, the city planners showed us this image:
p51
aVa forest of several hundred skyscrapers
p52
aVto emerge in the central business district,
p53
aVexcept at that time, only a handful of them existed.
p54
aVSo we had to design in a context that we knew almost nothing about,
p55
aVexcept one thing: it would all be about verticality.
p56
aa(lp57
VOf course, the skyscraper is vertical \u2014 it's a profoundly hierarchical structure,
p58
aVthe top always the best, the bottom the worst,
p59
aVand the taller you are, the better, so it seems.
p60
aVAnd we wanted to ask ourselves,
p61
aVcould a building be about a completely different quality?
p62
aVCould it undo this hierarchy, and could it be about a system
p63
aVthat is more about collaboration, rather than isolation?
p64
aVSo we took this needle and bent it back into itself,
p65
aVinto a loop of interconnected activities.
p66
aVOur idea was to bring all aspects of television-making
p67
aVinto one single structure: news, program production, broadcasting,
p68
aVresearch and training, administration \u2014
p69
aVall into a circuit of interconnected activities
p70
aVwhere people would meet in a process of exchange and collaboration.
p71
aa(lp72
VI still very much like this image.
p73
aVIt reminds one of biology classes, if you remember the human body
p74
aVwith all its organs and circulatory systems, like at school.
p75
aVAnd suddenly you think of architecture no longer as built substance,
p76
aVbut as an organism, as a life form.
p77
aVAnd as you start to dissect this organism,
p78
aVyou can identify a series of primary technical clusters \u2014
p79
aVprogram production, broadcasting center and news.
p80
aVThose are tightly intertwined with social clusters:
p81
aVmeeting rooms, canteens, chat areas \u2014
p82
aVinformal spaces for people to meet and exchange.
p83
aVSo the organizational structure of this building was a hybrid
p84
aVbetween the technical and the social,
p85
aVthe human and the performative.
p86
aVAnd of course, we used the loop of the building as a circulatory system,
p87
aVto thread everything together and to allow both visitors and staff
p88
aVto experience all these different functions in a great unity.
p89
aa(lp90
VWith 473,000 square meters,
p91
aVit is one of the largest buildings ever built in the world.
p92
aVIt has a population of over 10,000 people,
p93
aVand of course, this is a scale that exceeds the comprehension
p94
aVof many things and the scale of typical architecture.
p95
aVSo we stopped work for a while
p96
aVand sat down and cut 10,000 little sticks and glued them onto a model,
p97
aVjust simply to confront ourselves with what that quantity actually meant.
p98
aa(lp99
VBut of course, it's not a number,
p100
aVit is the people, it is a community that inhabits the building,
p101
aVand in order to both comprehend this, but also script this architecture,
p102
aVwe identified five characters, hypothetical characters,
p103
aVand we followed them throughout their day in a life in this building,
p104
aVthought of where they would meet, what they would experience.
p105
aVSo it was a way to script and design the building, but of course,
p106
aValso to communicate its experiences.
p107
aVThis was part of an exhibition with the Museum of Modern Art
p108
aVin both New York and Beijing.
p109
aa(lp110
VThis is the main broadcast control room,
p111
aVa technical installation so large,
p112
aVit can broadcast over 200 channels simultaneously.
p113
aVAnd this is how the building stands in Beijing today.
p114
aVIts first broadcast live was the London Olympics 2012,
p115
aVafter it had been completed from the outside for the Beijing Olympics.
p116
aVAnd you can see at the very tip of this 75-meter cantilever,
p117
aVthose three little circles.
p118
aVAnd they're indeed part of a public loop that goes through the building.
p119
aVThey're a piece of glass that you can stand on
p120
aVand watch the city pass by below you in slow motion.
p121
aa(lp122
VThe building has become part of everyday life in Beijing.
p123
aVIt is there.
p124
aVIt has also become a very popular backdrop
p125
aVfor wedding photography.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VBut its most important moment is maybe sill this one.
p130
aV"That's Beijing" is similar to "Time Out,"
p131
aVa magazine that broadcasts what is happening in town during the week,
p132
aVand suddenly you see the building portrayed no longer as physical matter,
p133
aVbut actually as an urban actor,
p134
aVas part of a series of personas that define the life of the city.
p135
aVSo architecture suddenly assumes the quality of a player,
p136
aVof something that writes stories and performs stories.
p137
aVAnd I think that could be one of its primary meanings
p138
aVthat we believe in.
p139
aa(lp140
VBut of course, there's another story to this building.
p141
aVIt is the story of the people that made it \u2014
p142
aV400 engineers and architects that I was guiding
p143
aVover almost a decade of collaborative work
p144
aVthat we spent together in scripting this building,
p145
aVin imagining its reality
p146
aVand ultimately getting it built in China.
p147
aa(lp148
VThis is a residential development in Singapore, large scale.
p149
aVIf we look at Singapore like most of Asia and more and more of the world,
p150
aVof course, it is dominated by the tower,
p151
aVa typology that indeed creates more isolation than connectedness,
p152
aVand I wanted to ask, how could we think about living,
p153
aVnot only in terms of the privacy and individuality of ourselves
p154
aVand our apartment,
p155
aVbut in an idea of a collective?
p156
aVHow could we think about creating a communal environment
p157
aVin which sharing things was as great as having your own?
p158
aa(lp159
VThe typical answer to the question \u2014 we had to design 1,040 apartments \u2014
p160
aVwould have looked like this:
p161
aV24-story height limit given by the planning authorities,
p162
aV12 towers with nothing but residual in between \u2014
p163
aVa very tight system that, although the tower isolates you,
p164
aVit doesn't even give you privacy, because you're so close to the next one,
p165
aVthat it is very questionable what the qualities of this would be.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo I proposed to topple the towers, throw the vertical into the horizontal
p168
aVand stack them up,
p169
aVand what looks a bit random from the side,
p170
aVif you look from the viewpoint of the helicopter,
p171
aVyou can see its organizational structure is actually a hexagonal grid,
p172
aVin which these horizontal building blocks are stacked up
p173
aVto create huge outdoor courtyards \u2014 central spaces for the community,
p174
aVprogrammed with a variety of amenities and functions.
p175
aVAnd you see that these courtyards are not hermetically sealed spaces.
p176
aVThey're open, permeable; they're interconnected.
p177
aVWe called the project "The Interlace,"
p178
aVthinking that we interlace and interconnect
p179
aVthe human beings and the spaces alike.
p180
aVAnd the detailed quality of everything we designed
p181
aVwas about animating the space and giving the space to the inhabitants.
p182
aVAnd, in fact, it was a system
p183
aVwhere we would layer primarily communal spaces,
p184
aVstacked to more and more individual and private spaces.
p185
aVSo we would open up a spectrum
p186
aVbetween the collective and the individual.
p187
aa(lp188
VA little piece of math:
p189
aVif we count all the green that we left on the ground,
p190
aVminus the footprint of the buildings,
p191
aVand we would add back the green of all the terraces,
p192
aVwe have 112 percent green space,
p193
aVso more nature than not having built a building.
p194
aVAnd of course this little piece of math shows you that we are multiplying
p195
aVthe space available to those who live there.
p196
aVThis is, in fact, the 13th floor of one of these terraces.
p197
aVSo you see new datum planes, new grounds planes for social activity.
p198
aa(lp199
VWe paid a lot of attention to sustainability.
p200
aVIn the tropics, the sun is the most important thing to pay attention to,
p201
aVand, in fact, it is seeking protection from the sun.
p202
aVWe first proved that all apartments would have sufficient daylight
p203
aVthrough the year.
p204
aVWe then went on to optimize the glazing of the facades
p205
aVto minimize the energy consumption of the building.
p206
aVBut most importantly, we could prove that through the geometry
p207
aVof the building design,
p208
aVthe building itself would provide sufficient shading to the courtyards
p209
aVso that those would be usable throughout the entire year.
p210
aVWe further placed water bodies along the prevailing wind corridors,
p211
aVso that evaporative cooling would create microclimates
p212
aVthat, again, would enhance the quality of those spaces
p213
aVavailable for the inhabitants.
p214
aVAnd it was the idea of creating this variety of choices,
p215
aVof freedom to think where you would want to be,
p216
aVwhere you would want to escape, maybe,
p217
aVwithin the own complexity of the complex in which you live.
p218
aa(lp219
VBut coming from Asia to Europe:
p220
aVa building for a German media company based in Berlin,
p221
aVtransitioning from the traditional print media to the digital media.
p222
aVAnd its CEO asked a few very pertinent questions:
p223
aVWhy would anyone today still want to go to the office,
p224
aVbecause you can actually work anywhere?
p225
aVAnd how could a digital identity of a company be embodied
p226
aVin a building?
p227
aVWe created not only an object, but at the center of this object
p228
aVwe created a giant space,
p229
aVand this space was about the experience of a collective,
p230
aVthe experience of collaboration and of togetherness.
p231
aVCommunication, interaction as the center of a space
p232
aVthat in itself would float,
p233
aVlike what we call the collaborative cloud,
p234
aVin the middle of the building,
p235
aVsurrounded by an envelope of standard modular offices.
p236
aVSo with only a few steps from your quiet work desk,
p237
aVyou could participate in the giant collective experience
p238
aVof the central space.
p239
aa(lp240
VFinally, we come to London, a project commissioned
p241
aVby the London Legacy Development Corporation
p242
aVof the Mayor of London.
p243
aVWe were asked to undertake a study
p244
aVand investigate the potential of a site
p245
aVout in Stratford in the Olympic Park.
p246
aVIn the 19th century, Prince Albert had created Albertopolis.
p247
aVAnd Boris Johnson thought of creating Olympicopolis.
p248
aa(lp249
VThe idea was to bring together some of Britain's greatest institutions,
p250
aVsome international ones, and to create a new system of synergies.
p251
aVPrince Albert, as yet, created Albertopolis in the 19th century,
p252
aVthought of showcasing all achievements of mankind,
p253
aVbringing arts and science closer together.
p254
aVAnd he built Exhibition Road, a linear sequence of those institutions.
p255
aa(lp256
VBut of course, today's society has moved on from there.
p257
aVWe no longer live in a world
p258
aVin which everything is as clearly delineated
p259
aVor separated from each other.
p260
aVWe live in a world in which boundaries start to blur
p261
aVbetween the different domains,
p262
aVand in which collaboration and interaction becomes far more important
p263
aVthan keeping separations.
p264
aVSo we wanted to think of a giant culture machine,
p265
aVa building that would orchestrate and animate the various domains,
p266
aVbut allow them to interact and collaborate.
p267
aVAt the base of it is a very simple module,
p268
aVa ring module.
p269
aVIt can function as a double-loaded corridor, has daylight, has ventilation.
p270
aVIt can be glazed over
p271
aVand turned into a giant exhibitional performance space.
p272
aVThese modules were stacked together
p273
aVwith the idea that almost any function could, over time,
p274
aVoccupy any of these modules.
p275
aVSo institutions could shrink or contract,
p276
aVas, of course, the future of culture is, in a way, the most uncertain of all.
p277
aVThis is how the building sits, adjacent to the Aquatics Centre,
p278
aVopposite the Olympic Stadium.
p279
aVAnd you can see how its cantilevering volumes
p280
aVproject out and engage the public space
p281
aVand how its courtyards animate the public inside.
p282
aa(lp283
VThe idea was to create a complex system
p284
aVin which institutional entities could maintain their own identity,
p285
aVin which they would not be subsumed in a singular volume.
p286
aVHere's a scale comparison to the Centre Pompidou in Paris.
p287
aVIt both shows the enormous scale and potential of the project,
p288
aVbut also the difference:
p289
aVhere, it is a multiplicity of a heterogeneous structure,
p290
aVin which different entities can interact
p291
aVwithout losing their own identity.
p292
aVAnd it was this thought: to create an organizational structure
p293
aVthat would allow for multiple narratives to be scripted \u2014
p294
aVfor those in the educational parts that create and think culture;
p295
aVfor those that present the visual arts, the dance;
p296
aVand for the public to be admitted into all of this
p297
aVwith a series of possible trajectories,
p298
aVto script their own reading of these narratives
p299
aVand their own experience.
p300
aa(lp301
VAnd I want to end on a project that is very small,
p302
aVin a way, very different:
p303
aVa floating cinema in the ocean of Thailand.
p304
aVFriends of mine had founded a film festival,
p305
aVand I thought,
p306
aVif we think of the stories and narratives of movies,
p307
aVwe should also think of the narratives of the people that watch them.
p308
aVSo I designed a small modular floating platform,
p309
aVbased on the techniques of local fishermen,
p310
aVhow they built their lobster and fish farms.
p311
aVWe collaborated with the local community
p312
aVand built, out of recycled materials of their own,
p313
aVthis fantastical floating platform
p314
aVthat gently moved in the ocean
p315
aVas we watched films from the British film archive,
p316
aV[1903] "Alice in Wonderland," for example.
p317
aVThe most primordial experiences of the audience
p318
aVmerged with the stories of the movies.
p319
aa(lp320
VSo I believe that architecture exceeds the domain of physical matter,
p321
aVof the built environment,
p322
aVbut is really about how we want to live our lives,
p323
aVhow we script our own stories and those of others.
p324
aa(lp325
VThank you.

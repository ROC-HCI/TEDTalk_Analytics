VA talk about surgical robots
p5
aVis also a talk about surgery.
p6
aVAnd while I've tried to make my images not too graphic,
p7
aVkeep in mind that surgeons have a different relationship with blood
p8
aVthan normal people do,
p9
aVbecause, after all, what a surgeon does to a patient,
p10
aVif it were done without consent,
p11
aVwould be a felony.
p12
aVSurgeons are the tailors, the plumbers,
p13
aVthe carpenters \u2014 some would say the butchers \u2014
p14
aVof the medical world:
p15
aVcutting, reshaping, reforming,
p16
aVbypassing, fixing.
p17
aVBut you need to talk about surgical instruments
p18
aVand the evolution of surgical technology together.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo in order to give you some kind of a perspective
p21
aVof where we are right now
p22
aVwith surgical robots,
p23
aVand where we're going to be going in the future,
p24
aVI want to give you a little bit of perspective
p25
aVof how we got to this point,
p26
aVhow we even came to believe
p27
aVthat surgery was OK,
p28
aVthat this was something that was possible to do,
p29
aVthat this kind of cutting and reforming was OK.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo, a little bit of perspective \u2014
p32
aVabout 10,000 years of perspective.
p33
aVThis is a trephinated skull.
p34
aVAnd trephination is simply just cutting a hole in the skull.
p35
aVAnd many, many hundreds of skulls like this
p36
aVhave been found in archaeological sites
p37
aVall over the world,
p38
aVdating back five to 10 thousand years.
p39
aVFive to 10 thousand years! Now imagine this.
p40
aVYou are a healer in a Stone Age village.
p41
aVAnd you have some guy that you're not quite sure what's wrong with him \u2014
p42
aVOliver Sacks is going to be born way in the future.
p43
aVHe's got some seizure disorder. And you don't understand this.
p44
aVBut you think to yourself,
p45
aV"I'm not quite sure what's wrong with this guy.
p46
aVBut maybe if I cut a hole in his head I can fix it."
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aVNow that is surgical thinking.
p49
aa(lp50
VNow we've got the dawn of interventional surgery here.
p51
aVWhat is astonishing about this is,
p52
aVeven though we don't know really how much of this
p53
aVwas intended to be religious,
p54
aVor how much of it was intended to be therapeutic,
p55
aVwhat we can tell is that these patients lived!
p56
aVJudging by the healing on the borders of these holes,
p57
aVthey lived days, months, years following trephination.
p58
aVAnd so what we are seeing is evidence
p59
aVof a refined technique
p60
aVthat was being handed down over thousands and thousands of years,
p61
aVall over the world.
p62
aVThis arose independently at sites everywhere
p63
aVthat had no communication to one another.
p64
aVWe really are seeing the dawn of interventional surgery.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow we can fast forward many thousands of years
p67
aVinto the Bronze Age and beyond.
p68
aVAnd we see new refined tools coming out.
p69
aVBut surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative
p70
aVthan their bold, trephinating ancestors.
p71
aVThese guys confined their surgery
p72
aVto fairly superficial injuries.
p73
aVAnd surgeons were tradesmen,
p74
aVrather than physicians.
p75
aVThis persisted all the way into and through the Renaissance.
p76
aa(lp77
VThat may have saved the writers,
p78
aVbut it didn't really save the surgeons terribly much.
p79
aVThey were still a mistrusted lot.
p80
aVSurgeons still had a bit of a PR problem,
p81
aVbecause the landscape was dominated
p82
aVby the itinerant barber surgeon.
p83
aVThese were folks that traveled from village to village, town to town,
p84
aVdoing surgery sort of as a form of performance art.
p85
aVBecause we were in the age before anesthesia,
p86
aVthe agony of the patient
p87
aVis really as much of the public spectacle
p88
aVas the surgery itself.
p89
aVOne of the most famous of these guys, Frere Jacques,
p90
aVshown here doing a lithotomy \u2014
p91
aVwhich is the removal of the bladder stone,
p92
aVone of the most invasive surgeries they did at the time \u2014
p93
aVhad to take less than two minutes.
p94
aVYou had to have quite a flair for the dramatic,
p95
aVand be really, really quick.
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd so here you see him doing a lithotomy.
p98
aVAnd he is credited with doing over 4,000 of these public surgeries,
p99
aVwandering around in Europe,
p100
aVwhich is an astonishing number,
p101
aVwhen you think that surgery must have been a last resort.
p102
aVI mean who would put themselves through that?
p103
aVUntil anesthesia, the absence of sensation.
p104
aVWith the demonstration of the Morton Ether Inhaler
p105
aVat the Mass. General in 1847,
p106
aVa whole new era of surgery was ushered in.
p107
aVAnesthesia gave surgeons the freedom to operate.
p108
aVAnesthesia gave them the freedom to experiment,
p109
aVto start to delve deeper into the body.
p110
aVThis was truly a revolution in surgery.
p111
aa(lp112
VBut there was a pretty big problem with this.
p113
aVAfter these very long, painstaking operations,
p114
aVattempting to cure things they'd never been able to touch before,
p115
aVthe patients died.
p116
aVThey died of massive infection.
p117
aVSurgery didn't hurt anymore,
p118
aVbut it killed you pretty quickly.
p119
aVAnd infection would continue to claim a majority of surgical patients
p120
aVuntil the next big revolution in surgery,
p121
aVwhich was aseptic technique.
p122
aa(lp123
VJoseph Lister was aepsis's,
p124
aVor sterility's, biggest advocate,
p125
aVto a very very skeptical bunch of surgeons.
p126
aVBut eventually they did come around.
p127
aVThe Mayo brothers came out to visit Lister in Europe.
p128
aVAnd they came back to their American clinic and they said
p129
aVthey had learned it was as important to wash your hands
p130
aVbefore doing surgery
p131
aVas it was to wash up afterwards. (Laughter)
p132
aVSomething so simple.
p133
aVAnd yet, operative mortality dropped profoundly.
p134
aa(lp135
VThese surgeries were actually now being effective.
p136
aVWith the patient insensitive to pain,
p137
aVand a sterile operating field
p138
aVall bets were off, the sky was the limit.
p139
aVYou could now start doing surgery everywhere,
p140
aVon the gut, on the liver,
p141
aVon the heart, on the brain.
p142
aVTransplantation: you could take an organ out of one person,
p143
aVyou could put it in another person, and it would work.
p144
aVSurgeons didn't have a problem with respectability anymore;
p145
aVthey had become gods.
p146
aa(lp147
VThe era of the "big surgeon, big incision" had arrived,
p148
aVbut at quite a cost,
p149
aVbecause they are saving lives,
p150
aVbut not necessarily quality of life,
p151
aVbecause healthy people don't usually need surgery,
p152
aVand unhealthy people have a very hard time recovering from a cut like that.
p153
aVThe question had to be asked,
p154
aV"Well, can we do these same surgeries
p155
aVbut through little incisions?"
p156
aVLaparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery:
p157
aVsurgery with long instruments through small incisions.
p158
aVAnd it really changed the landscape of surgery.
p159
aVSome of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years,
p160
aVbut it had only been used as a diagnostic technique
p161
aVuntil the 1980s,
p162
aVwhen there was changes in camera technologies and things like that,
p163
aVthat allowed this to be done for real operations.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo what you see \u2014 this is now the first surgical image \u2014
p166
aVas we're coming down the tube, this is a new entry into the body.
p167
aVIt looks very different from what you're expecting surgery to look like.
p168
aVWe bring instruments in,
p169
aVfrom two separate cuts in the side,
p170
aVand then you can start manipulating tissue.
p171
aVWithin 10 years of the first gallbladder surgeries
p172
aVbeing done laparoscopically,
p173
aVa majority of gallbladder surgeries
p174
aVwere being done laparoscopically \u2014
p175
aVtruly a pretty big revolution.
p176
aa(lp177
VBut there were casualties of this revolution.
p178
aVThese techniques were a lot harder to learn
p179
aVthan people had anticipated.
p180
aVThe learning curve was very long.
p181
aVAnd during that learning curve the complications went quite a bit higher.
p182
aVSurgeons had to give up their 3D vision.
p183
aVThey had to give up their wrists.
p184
aVThey had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments.
p185
aVThis surgeon has over 3,000 hours of laparoscopic experience.
p186
aVNow this is a particularly frustrating placement of the needle.
p187
aVBut this is hard.
p188
aVAnd one of the reasons why it is so hard
p189
aVis because the external ergonomics are terrible.
p190
aVYou've got these long instruments, and you're working off your centerline.
p191
aVAnd the instruments are essentially working backwards.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo what you need to do, to take the capability of your hand,
p194
aVand put it on the other side of that small incision,
p195
aVis you need to put a wrist on that instrument.
p196
aVAnd so \u2014 I get to talk about robots \u2014
p197
aVthe da Vinci robot
p198
aVput just that wrist on the other side of that incision.
p199
aVAnd so here you're seeing the operation of this wrist.
p200
aVAnd now, in contrast to the laparoscopy,
p201
aVyou can precisely place the needle in your instruments,
p202
aVand you can pass it all the way through
p203
aVand follow it in a trajectory.
p204
aVAnd the reason why this becomes so much easier
p205
aVis \u2014 you can see on the bottom \u2014
p206
aVthe hands are making the motions,
p207
aVand the instruments are following those motions exactly.
p208
aVNow, what you put between those instruments and those hands,
p209
aVis a large, fairly complicated robot.
p210
aVThe surgeon is sitting at a console,
p211
aVand controlling the robot with these controllers.
p212
aVAnd the robot is moving these instruments around,
p213
aVand powering them, down inside the body.
p214
aVYou have a 3D camera, so you get a 3D view.
p215
aa(lp216
VAnd since this was introduced in 1999,
p217
aVa lot of these robots have been out
p218
aVand being used for surgical procedures like a prostatectomy,
p219
aVwhich is a prostate deep in the pelvis,
p220
aVand it requires fine dissection
p221
aVand delicate manipulation
p222
aVto be able to get a good surgical outcome.
p223
aVYou can also sew bypass vessels directly onto a beating heart
p224
aVwithout cracking the chest.
p225
aVThis is all done in between the ribs.
p226
aVAnd you can go inside the heart itself
p227
aVand repair the valves from the inside.
p228
aVYou've got these technologies \u2014 thank you \u2014
p229
aV(Applause)
p230
aVAnd so you might say, "Wow this is really cool!
p231
aVSo, smartypants, why isn't all surgery being done this way?"
p232
aVAnd there are some reasons, some good reasons.
p233
aVAnd cost is one of them.
p234
aa(lp235
VI talked about the large, complicated robot.
p236
aVWith all its bells and whistles, one of those robots
p237
aVwill cost you about as much as a solid gold surgeon.
p238
aVMore useful than a solid gold surgeon,
p239
aVbut, still, it's a fairly big capital investment.
p240
aVBut once you've got it, your procedure costs do come down.
p241
aVBut there are other barriers.
p242
aVSo something like a prostatectomy \u2014
p243
aVthe prostate is small, and it's in one spot,
p244
aVand you can set your robot up very precisely
p245
aVto work in that one spot.
p246
aVAnd so it's perfect for something like that.
p247
aVAnd in fact if you, or anyone you know,
p248
aVhad their prostate taken out in the last couple of years,
p249
aVchances are it was done with one of these systems.
p250
aVBut if you need to reach more places than just one,
p251
aVyou need to move the robot.
p252
aVAnd you need to put some new incisions in there.
p253
aVAnd you need to re-set it up.
p254
aVAnd then you need to add some more ports, and more.
p255
aVAnd the problem is it gets time-consuming, and cumbersome.
p256
aa(lp257
VAnd for that reason there are many surgeries
p258
aVthat just aren't being done with the da Vinci.
p259
aVSo we had to ask the question, "Well how do we fix that?"
p260
aVWhat if we could change it so that we didn't have to re-set up
p261
aVeach time we wanted to move somewhere different?
p262
aVWhat if we could bring all the instruments
p263
aVin together in one place?
p264
aVHow would that change the capabilities of the surgeon?
p265
aVAnd how would that change the experience for the patient?
p266
aVNow, to do that,
p267
aVwe need to be able to bring a camera
p268
aVand instruments in together through one small tube,
p269
aVlike that tube you saw in the laparoscopy video.
p270
aVOr, not so coincidentally, like a tube like this.
p271
aa(lp272
VSo what's going to come out of that tube
p273
aVis the debut of this new technology,
p274
aVthis new robot that is going to be able to reach anywhere.
p275
aVReady? So here it comes.
p276
aVThis is the camera, and three instruments.
p277
aVAnd as you see it come out,
p278
aVin order to actually be able to do anything useful,
p279
aVit can't all stay clustered up like this.
p280
aVIt has to be able to come off of the centerline
p281
aVand then be able to work back toward that centerline.
p282
aVHe's a cheeky little devil.
p283
aVBut what this lets you do
p284
aVis gives you that all-important traction,
p285
aVand counter-traction,
p286
aVso that you can dissect, so that you can sew,
p287
aVso that you can do all the things that you need to do,
p288
aVall the surgical tasks.
p289
aVBut it's all coming in through one incision.
p290
aVIt's not so simple.
p291
aVBut it's worth it for the freedom that this gives us
p292
aVas we're going around.
p293
aVFor the patient, however,
p294
aVit's transparent. This is all they're going to see.
p295
aa(lp296
VIt's very exciting to think where we get to go with this.
p297
aVWe get to write the script of the next revolution in surgery.
p298
aVAs we take these capabilities, and we get to go to the next places,
p299
aVwe get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be.
p300
aVAnd I think to really get the rest of the way
p301
aVin that revolution,
p302
aVwe need to not just take our hands in in new ways,
p303
aVwe also need to take our eyes in in new ways.
p304
aVWe need to see beyond the surface.
p305
aVWe need to be able to guide what we're cutting
p306
aVin a much better way.
p307
aa(lp308
VThis is a cancer surgery.
p309
aVOne of the problems with this,
p310
aVeven for surgeons who've been looking at this a lot,
p311
aVis you can't see the cancer,
p312
aVespecially when it's hidden below the surface.
p313
aVAnd so what we're starting to do
p314
aVis we're starting to inject specially designed markers
p315
aVinto the bloodstream that will target the cancer.
p316
aVIt will go, bind to the cancer.
p317
aVAnd we can make those markers glow.
p318
aVAnd we can take special cameras,
p319
aVand we can look at it.
p320
aVNow we know where we need to cut,
p321
aVeven when it's below the surface.
p322
aVWe can take these markers and we can inject them in a tumor site.
p323
aVAnd we can follow where they flow out from that tumor site,
p324
aVso we can see the first places where that cancer might travel.
p325
aVWe can inject these dyes into the bloodstream,
p326
aVso that when we do a new vessel
p327
aVand we bypass a blockage on the heart,
p328
aVwe can see if we actually made the connection,
p329
aVbefore we close that patient back up again \u2014
p330
aVsomething that we haven't been able to do
p331
aVwithout radiation before.
p332
aVWe can light up tumors
p333
aVlike this kidney tumor,
p334
aVso that you can exactly see where the boundary is
p335
aVbetween the kidney tumor and the kidney you want to leave behind,
p336
aVor the liver tumor and the liver you want to leave behind.
p337
aa(lp338
VAnd we don't even need to confine ourselves
p339
aVto this macro vision.
p340
aVWe have flexible microscopic probes
p341
aVthat we can bring down into the body.
p342
aVAnd we can look at cells directly.
p343
aVI'm looking at nerves here. So these are nerves you see, down on the bottom,
p344
aVand the microscope probe that's being held by the robotic hand, up at the top.
p345
aVSo this is all very prototypey at this point.
p346
aVBut you care about nerves, if you are a surgical patient.
p347
aVBecause they let you keep continence,
p348
aVbladder control, and sexual function after surgery,
p349
aVall of which is generally fairly important to the patient.
p350
aa(lp351
VSo, with the combination of these technologies
p352
aVwe can reach it all, and we can see it all.
p353
aVWe can heal the disease.
p354
aVAnd we can leave the patient whole and intact
p355
aVand functional afterwards.
p356
aVNow, I've talked about the patient
p357
aVas if the patient is, somehow, someone abstract
p358
aVoutside this room.
p359
aVAnd that is not the case.
p360
aVMany of you, all of you maybe,
p361
aVwill at some point, or have already, faced a diagnosis of cancer,
p362
aVor heart disease, or some organ dysfunction
p363
aVthat's going to buy you a date with a surgeon.
p364
aVAnd when you get to that point \u2014
p365
aVI mean, these maladies don't care
p366
aVhow many books you've written,
p367
aVhow many companies you've started,
p368
aVthat Nobel Prize you have yet to win,
p369
aVhow much time you planned to spend with your children.
p370
aVThese maladies come for us all.
p371
aa(lp372
VAnd the prospect I'm offering you, of an easier surgery ...
p373
aVis that going to make that diagnosis any less terrifying?
p374
aVI'm not sure I really even want it to.
p375
aVBecause facing your own mortality
p376
aVcauses a re-evaluation of priorities,
p377
aVand a realignment of what your goals are in life, unlike anything else.
p378
aVAnd I would never want to deprive you of that epiphany.
p379
aVWhat I want instead,
p380
aVis for you to be whole, intact,
p381
aVand functional enough to go out and save the world,
p382
aVafter you've decided you need to do it.
p383
aVAnd that is my vision for your future.
p384
aVThank you.

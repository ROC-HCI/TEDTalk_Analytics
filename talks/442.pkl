VI became an inventor by accident.
p5
aVI was out of the air force in 1956. No, no, that's not true:
p6
aVI went in in 1956, came out in 1959,
p7
aVwas working at the University of Washington,
p8
aVand I came up with an idea, from reading a magazine article,
p9
aVfor a new kind of a phonograph tone arm.
p10
aVNow, that was before cassette tapes, C.D.s, DVDs \u2014
p11
aVany of the cool stuff we've got now.
p12
aVAnd it was an arm that,
p13
aVinstead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record,
p14
aVwent straight: a radial, linear tracking tone arm.
p15
aVAnd it was the hardest invention I ever made, but it got me started,
p16
aVand I got really lucky after that.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd without giving you too much of a tirade,
p19
aVI want to talk to you about an invention I brought with me today:
p20
aVmy 44th invention. No, that's not true either.
p21
aVGolly, I'm just totally losing it.
p22
aVMy 44th patent; about the 15th invention.
p23
aVI call this hypersonic sound.
p24
aVI'm going to play it for you in a couple minutes,
p25
aVbut I want to make an analogy before I do
p26
aVto this.
p27
aVI usually show this hypersonic sound and people will say,
p28
aVThat's really cool, but what's it good for?
p29
aVAnd I say, What is the light bulb good for?
p30
aVSound, light: I'm going to draw the analogy.
p31
aVWhen Edison invented the light bulb, pretty much looked like this.
p32
aVHasn't changed that much.
p33
aVLight came out of it in every direction.
p34
aVBefore the light bulb was invented,
p35
aVpeople had figured out how to put a reflector behind it,
p36
aVfocus it a little bit;
p37
aVput lenses in front of it,
p38
aVfocus it a little bit better.
p39
aVUltimately we figured out how to make things like lasers
p40
aVthat were totally focused.
p41
aa(lp42
VNow, think about where the world would be today
p43
aVif we had the light bulb,
p44
aVbut you couldn't focus light;
p45
aVif when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to.
p46
aVThat's the way loudspeakers pretty much are.
p47
aVYou turn on the loudspeaker,
p48
aVand after almost 80 years of having those gadgets,
p49
aVthe sound just kind of goes where it wants.
p50
aVEven when you're standing in front of a megaphone,
p51
aVit's pretty much every direction.
p52
aVA little bit of differential, but not much.
p53
aVIf the light bulb was the way the speaker is,
p54
aVand you couldn't focus or sharpen the edges or define it,
p55
aVwe wouldn't have that, or movies in general,
p56
aVor computers, or T.V. sets,
p57
aVor C.D.s, or DVDs \u2014 and just go down the list
p58
aVof what the importance is
p59
aVof being able to focus light.
p60
aa(lp61
VNow, after almost 80 years of having sound,
p62
aVI thought it was about time that we figure out
p63
aVa way to put sound where you want to.
p64
aVI have a couple of units.
p65
aVThat guy there was made for a demo I did yesterday early in the day
p66
aVfor a big car maker in Detroit who wants to put them in a car \u2014
p67
aVsmall version, over your head \u2014
p68
aVso that you can actually get binaural sound in a car.
p69
aVWhat if I could aim sound the way I aim light?
p70
aa(lp71
VI got this waterfall I recorded in my back yard.
p72
aVNow, you're not going to hear a thing unless it hits you.
p73
aVMaybe if I hit the side wall it will bounce around the room.
p74
aV(Applause)
p75
aVThe sound is being made right next to your ears. Is that cool?
p76
aV(Applause)
p77
aVBecause I have some limited time, I'll cut it off for a second,
p78
aVand tell you about how it works and what it's good for.
p79
aa(lp80
VCourse, like light, it's great to be able to put sound
p81
aVto highlight a clothing rack, or the cornflakes, or the toothpaste,
p82
aVor a talking plaque in a movie theater lobby.
p83
aVSony's got an idea \u2014 Sony's our biggest customers right now.
p84
aVThey tried this back in the '60s
p85
aVand were too smart, and so they gave up.
p86
aVBut they want to use it \u2014 seriously.
p87
aVThere's a mix an inventor has to have.
p88
aVYou have to be kind of smart,
p89
aVand though I did not graduate from college doesn't mean I'm stupid,
p90
aVbecause you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today.
p91
aVToo many other smart people out there. So.
p92
aVI just happened to get my education in a little different way.
p93
aVI'm not at all against education.
p94
aVI think it's wonderful; I think sometimes people,
p95
aVwhen they get educated, lose it:
p96
aVthey get so smart they're unwilling to look at things that they know better than.
p97
aVAnd we're living in a great time right now,
p98
aVbecause almost everything's being explored anew.
p99
aVI have this little slogan that I use a lot, which is:
p100
aVvirtually nothing \u2014
p101
aVand I mean this honestly \u2014
p102
aVhas been invented yet.
p103
aVWe're just starting.
p104
aVWe're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics.
p105
aVAnd this is, I hope, a little piece of it.
p106
aa(lp107
VSony's got this vision back \u2014 to get myself on track \u2014
p108
aVthat when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket,
p109
aVyou're going to watch a new T.V. channel.
p110
aVThey know that when you watch T.V. at home,
p111
aVbecause there are so many choices
p112
aVyou can change channels, miss their commercials.
p113
aVA hundred and fifty-one million people every day stand in the line at the supermarket.
p114
aVNow, they've tried this a couple years ago and it failed,
p115
aVbecause the checker gets tired of hearing the same message
p116
aVevery 20 minutes, and reaches out, turns off the sound.
p117
aVAnd, you know, if the sound isn't there, the sale typically isn't made.
p118
aVFor instance, like, when you're on an airplane, they show the movie,
p119
aVyou get to watch it for free;
p120
aVwhen you want to hear the sound, you pay.
p121
aVAnd so ABC and Sony have devised this new thing
p122
aVwhere when you step in the line in the supermarket \u2014
p123
aVinitially it'll be Safeways. It is Safeways;
p124
aVthey're trying this in three parts of the country right now \u2014
p125
aVyou'll be watching TV.
p126
aa(lp127
VAnd hopefully they'll be sensitive
p128
aVthat they don't want to offend you with just one more outlet.
p129
aVBut what's great about it, from the tests that have been done, is,
p130
aVif you don't want to hear it,
p131
aVyou take about one step to the side and you don't hear it.
p132
aVSo, we create silence as much as we create sound.
p133
aVATMs that talk to you; nobody else hears it.
p134
aVSit in bed, two in the morning, watch TV;
p135
aVyour spouse, or someone, is next to you, asleep;
p136
aVdoesn't hear it, doesn't wake up.
p137
aVWe're also working on noise canceling things like snoring, noise from automobiles.
p138
aa(lp139
VI have been really lucky with this technology:
p140
aVall of a sudden as it is ready, the world is ready to accept it.
p141
aVThey have literally beat a path to our door.
p142
aVWe've been selling it since about last September, October,
p143
aVand it's been immensely gratifying.
p144
aVIf you're interested in what it costs \u2014 I'm not selling them today \u2014
p145
aVbut this unit, with the electronics and everything,
p146
aVif you buy one, is around a thousand bucks.
p147
aVWe expect by this time next year,
p148
aVit'll be hundreds, a few hundred bucks, to buy it.
p149
aVIt's not any more pricey than regular electronics.
p150
aa(lp151
VNow, when I played it for you, you didn't hear the thunderous bass.
p152
aVThis unit that I played goes from about 200 hertz to above the range of hearing.
p153
aVIt's actually emitting ultrasound \u2014 low-level ultrasound \u2014
p154
aVthat's about 100,000 vibrations per second.
p155
aVAnd the sound that you're hearing,
p156
aVunlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face,
p157
aVis made out in front of it, in the air.
p158
aVThe air is not linear, as we've always been taught.
p159
aVYou turn up the volume just a little bit \u2014
p160
aVI'm talking about a little over 80 decibels \u2014
p161
aVand all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate.
p162
aVHere's why: the speed of sound is not a constant. It's fairly slow.
p163
aVIt changes with temperature and with barometric pressure.
p164
aa(lp165
VNow, imagine, if you will, without getting too technical,
p166
aVI'm making a little sine wave here in the air.
p167
aVWell, if I turn up the amplitude too much,
p168
aVI'm having an effect on the pressure,
p169
aVwhich means during the making of that sine wave,
p170
aVthe speed at which it is propagating is shifting.
p171
aVAll of audio as we know it
p172
aVis an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear.
p173
aVLinearity means higher quality sound.
p174
aVHypersonic sound is exactly the opposite:
p175
aVit's 100 percent based on non-linearity.
p176
aVAn effect happens in the air, it's a corrupting effect of the sound \u2014
p177
aVthe ultrasound in this case \u2014 that's emitted,
p178
aVbut it's so predictable
p179
aVthat you can produce very precise audio out of that effect.
p180
aa(lp181
VNow, the question is, where's the sound made?
p182
aVInstead of being made on the face of the cone,
p183
aVit's made at literally billions of little independent points
p184
aValong this narrow column in the air,
p185
aVand so when I aim it towards you,
p186
aVwhat you hear is made right next to your ears.
p187
aVI said we can shorten the column,
p188
aVwe can spread it out to cover the couch.
p189
aVI can put it so that one ear hears one speaker,
p190
aVthe other ear hears the other. That's true binaural sound.
p191
aVWhen you listen to stereo on your home system,
p192
aVyour both ears hear both speakers.
p193
aVTurn on the left speaker sometime
p194
aVand notice you're hearing it also in your right ear.
p195
aVSo, the stage is more restricted \u2014
p196
aVthe sound stage that's supposed to spread out in front of you.
p197
aVBecause the sound is made in the air along this column,
p198
aVit does not follow the inverse square law,
p199
aVwhich says it drops off about two thirds
p200
aVevery time you double the distance:
p201
aV6dB every time you go from one meter, for instance, to two meters.
p202
aVThat means you go to a rock concert or a symphony,
p203
aVand the guy in the front row gets the same level
p204
aVas the guy in the back row, now, all of a sudden.
p205
aVIsn't that terrific?
p206
aa(lp207
VSo, we've been, as I say, very successful, very lucky,
p208
aVin having companies catch the vision of this,
p209
aVfrom cars \u2014 car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids,
p210
aVand a separate system in the back \u2014
p211
aVoh, no, the kids aren't driving today.
p212
aV(Laughter)
p213
aVI was seeing if you were listening.
p214
aVActually, I haven't had breakfast yet.
p215
aVA stereo system in the front for mom and dad,
p216
aVand maybe there's a little DVD player in the back for the kids,
p217
aVand the parents don't want to be bothered with that,
p218
aVor their rap music or whatever.
p219
aVSo, again, this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to
p220
aVis really starting to catch on.
p221
aVIt also works for transmitting and communicating data.
p222
aVIt also works five times better underwater.
p223
aa(lp224
VWe've got the military \u2014 have just deployed some of these into Iraq,
p225
aVwhere you can put fake troop movements
p226
aVquarter of a mile away on a hillside.
p227
aV(Laughter)
p228
aVOr you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some Biblical verse.
p229
aV(Laughter)
p230
aVI'm serious. And they have these infrared devices
p231
aVthat can look at their countenance,
p232
aVand see a fraction of a degree Kelvin in temperature shift
p233
aVfrom 100 yards away when they play this thing.
p234
aVAnd so, another way of hopefully determining who's friendly and who isn't.
p235
aVWe make a version with this which puts out 155 decibels.
p236
aVPain is 120.
p237
aVSo it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people,
p238
aVand there can be a public beach just off to the side,
p239
aVand they don't even know it's turned on.
p240
aVWe sell those to the military presently for about 70,000 dollars,
p241
aVand they're buying them as fast as we can make them.
p242
aVWe put it on a turret with a camera, so that when they shoot at you,
p243
aVyou're over there, and it's there.
p244
aa(lp245
VI have a bunch of other inventions.
p246
aVI invented a plasma antenna, to shift gears.
p247
aVLooked up at the ceiling of my office one day \u2014
p248
aVI was working on a ground-penetrating radar project \u2014
p249
aVand my physicist CEO came in and said, "We have a real problem.
p250
aVWe're using very short wavelengths.
p251
aVWe've got a problem with the antenna ringing.
p252
aVWhen you run very short wavelengths,
p253
aVlike a tuning fork the antenna resonates,
p254
aVand there's more energy coming out of the antenna
p255
aVthan there is the backscatter from the ground
p256
aVthat we're trying to analyze, taking too much processing."
p257
aVI says, "Why don't we make an antenna that only exists when you want it?
p258
aVTurn it on; turn it off.
p259
aVThat's a fluorescent tube refined."
p260
aVI just sold that for a million and a half dollars, cash.
p261
aVI took it back to the Pentagon after it got declassified,
p262
aVwhen the patent issued, and told the people back there about it,
p263
aVand they laughed, and then I took them back a demo and they bought.
p264
aV(Laughter)
p265
aa(lp266
VAny of you ever wore a Jabber headphone \u2014 the little cell headphones?
p267
aVThat's my invention. I sold that for seven million dollars.
p268
aVBig mistake: it just sold for 80 million dollars two years ago.
p269
aVI actually drew that up on a little crummy Mac computer
p270
aVin my attic at my house,
p271
aVand one of the many designs which they have now
p272
aVis still the same design I drew way back when.
p273
aa(lp274
VSo, I've been really lucky as an inventor.
p275
aVI'm the happiest guy you're ever going to meet.
p276
aVAnd my dad died before he realized anybody in the family
p277
aVwould maybe, hopefully, make something out of themselves.
p278
aVYou've been a great audience. I know I've jumped all over the place.
p279
aVI usually figure out what my talk is when I get up in front of a group.
p280
aa(lp281
VLet me give you, in the last minute,
p282
aVone more quick demo of this guy,
p283
aVfor those of you that haven't heard it.
p284
aVCan never tell if it's on.
p285
aVIf you haven't heard it, raise your hand.
p286
aVGetting it over there?
p287
aVGet the cameraman.
p288
aVYeah, there you go.
p289
aVI've got a Coke can opening that's right in your head; that's really cool.
p290
aVThank you once again.
p291
aVAppreciate it very much.

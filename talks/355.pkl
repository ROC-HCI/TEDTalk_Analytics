VWhat I want to tell you about today is how I see robots invading our lives
p5
aVat multiple levels, over multiple timescales.
p6
aVAnd when I look out in the future, I can't imagine a world, 500 years from now,
p7
aVwhere we don't have robots everywhere.
p8
aVAssuming \u2014 despite all the dire predictions from many people about our future \u2014
p9
aVassuming we're still around, I can't imagine the world not being populated with robots.
p10
aVAnd then the question is, well, if they're going to be here in 500 years,
p11
aVare they going to be everywhere sooner than that?
p12
aVAre they going to be around in 50 years?
p13
aVYeah, I think that's pretty likely \u2014 there's going to be lots of robots everywhere.
p14
aVAnd in fact I think that's going to be a lot sooner than that.
p15
aVI think we're sort of on the cusp of robots becoming common,
p16
aVand I think we're sort of around 1978 or 1980 in personal computer years,
p17
aVwhere the first few robots are starting to appear.
p18
aa(lp19
VComputers sort of came around through games and toys.
p20
aVAnd you know, the first computer most people had in the house
p21
aVmay have been a computer to play Pong,
p22
aVa little microprocessor embedded,
p23
aVand then other games that came after that.
p24
aVAnd we're starting to see that same sort of thing with robots:
p25
aVLEGO Mindstorms, Furbies \u2014 who here \u2014 did anyone here have a Furby?
p26
aVYeah, there's 38 million of them sold worldwide.
p27
aVThey are pretty common. And they're a little tiny robot,
p28
aVa simple robot with some sensors,
p29
aVa little bit of processing actuation.
p30
aa(lp31
VOn the right there is another robot doll, who you could get a couple of years ago.
p32
aVAnd just as in the early days,
p33
aVwhen there was a lot of sort of amateur interaction over computers,
p34
aVyou can now get various hacking kits, how-to-hack books.
p35
aVAnd on the left there is a platform from Evolution Robotics,
p36
aVwhere you put a PC on, and you program this thing with a GUI
p37
aVto wander around your house and do various stuff.
p38
aVAnd then there's a higher price point sort of robot toys \u2014
p39
aVthe Sony Aibo. And on the right there, is one that the NEC developed,
p40
aVthe PaPeRo, which I don't think they're going to release.
p41
aVBut nevertheless, those sorts of things are out there.
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd we've seen, over the last two or three years, lawn-mowing robots,
p44
aVHusqvarna on the bottom, Friendly Robotics on top there, an Israeli company.
p45
aVAnd then in the last 12 months or so
p46
aVwe've started to see a bunch of home-cleaning robots appear.
p47
aVThe top left one is a very nice home-cleaning robot
p48
aVfrom a company called Dyson, in the U.K. Except it was so expensive \u2014
p49
aV3,500 dollars \u2014 they didn't release it.
p50
aa(lp51
VBut at the bottom left, you see Electrolux, which is on sale.
p52
aVAnother one from Karcher.
p53
aVAt the bottom right is one that I built in my lab
p54
aVabout 10 years ago, and we finally turned that into a product.
p55
aVAnd let me just show you that.
p56
aVWe're going to give this away I think, Chris said, after the talk.
p57
aVThis is a robot that you can go out and buy, and that will clean up your floor.
p58
aVAnd it starts off sort of just going around in ever-increasing circles.
p59
aVIf it hits something \u2014 you people see that?
p60
aVNow it's doing wall-following, it's following around my feet
p61
aVto clean up around me. Let's see, let's \u2014
p62
aVoh, who stole my Rice Krispies? They stole my Rice Krispies!
p63
aV(Laughter)
p64
aVDon't worry, relax, no, relax, it's a robot, it's smart!
p65
aV(Laughter)
p66
aVSee, the three-year-old kids, they don't worry about it.
p67
aVIt's grown-ups that get really upset.
p68
aV(Laughter)
p69
aVWe'll just put some crap here.
p70
aV(Laughter)
p71
aVOkay.
p72
aV(Laughter)
p73
aVI don't know if you see \u2014 so, I put a bunch of Rice Krispies there,
p74
aVI put some pennies, let's just shoot it at that, see if it cleans up.
p75
aVYeah, OK. So \u2014
p76
aVwe'll leave that for later.
p77
aV(Applause)
p78
aa(lp79
VPart of the trick was building a better cleaning mechanism, actually;
p80
aVthe intelligence on board was fairly simple.
p81
aVAnd that's true with a lot of robots.
p82
aVWe've all, I think, become, sort of computational chauvinists,
p83
aVand think that computation is everything,
p84
aVbut the mechanics still matter.
p85
aVHere's another robot, the PackBot,
p86
aVthat we've been building for a bunch of years.
p87
aVIt's a military surveillance robot, to go in ahead of troops \u2014
p88
aVlooking at caves, for instance.
p89
aVBut we had to make it fairly robust,
p90
aVmuch more robust than the robots we build in our labs.
p91
aV(Laughter)
p92
aVOn board that robot is a PC running Linux.
p93
aVIt can withstand a 400G shock. The robot has local intelligence:
p94
aVit can flip itself over, can get itself into communication range,
p95
aVcan go upstairs by itself, et cetera.
p96
aVOkay, so it's doing local navigation there.
p97
aVA soldier gives it a command to go upstairs, and it does.
p98
aVThat was not a controlled descent.
p99
aV(Laughter)
p100
aVNow it's going to head off.
p101
aVAnd the big breakthrough for these robots, really, was September 11th.
p102
aVWe had the robots down at the World Trade Center late that evening.
p103
aVCouldn't do a lot in the main rubble pile,
p104
aVthings were just too \u2014 there was nothing left to do.
p105
aVBut we did go into all the surrounding buildings that had been evacuated,
p106
aVand searched for possible survivors in the buildings
p107
aVthat were too dangerous to go into.
p108
aVLet's run this video.
p109
aVReporter: ...battlefield companions are helping to reduce the combat risks.
p110
aVNick Robertson has that story.
p111
aVRodney Brooks: Can we have another one of these?
p112
aVOkay, good.
p113
aVSo, this is a corporal who had seen a robot two weeks previously.
p114
aVHe's sending robots into caves, looking at what's going on.
p115
aVThe robot's being totally autonomous.
p116
aVThe worst thing that's happened in the cave so far
p117
aVwas one of the robots fell down ten meters.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo one year ago, the US military didn't have these robots.
p120
aVNow they're on active duty in Afghanistan every day.
p121
aVAnd that's one of the reasons they say a robot invasion is happening.
p122
aVThere's a sea change happening in how \u2014 where technology's going.
p123
aVThanks.
p124
aVAnd over the next couple of months,
p125
aVwe're going to be sending robots in production
p126
aVdown producing oil wells to get that last few years of oil out of the ground.
p127
aVVery hostile environments, 150\u02da C, 10,000 PSI.
p128
aVAutonomous robots going down, doing this sort of work.
p129
aVBut robots like this, they're a little hard to program.
p130
aVHow, in the future, are we going to program our robots
p131
aVand make them easier to use?
p132
aVAnd I want to actually use a robot here \u2014
p133
aVa robot named Chris \u2014 stand up. Yeah. Okay.
p134
aVCome over here. Now notice, he thinks robots have to be a bit stiff.
p135
aVHe sort of does that. But I'm going to \u2014
p136
aVChris Anderson: I'm just British. RB: Oh.
p137
aV(Laughter)
p138
aV(Applause)
p139
aVI'm going to show this robot a task. It's a very complex task.
p140
aVNow notice, he nodded there, he was giving me some indication
p141
aVhe was understanding the flow of communication.
p142
aVAnd if I'd said something completely bizarre
p143
aVhe would have looked askance at me, and regulated the conversation.
p144
aVSo now I brought this up in front of him.
p145
aVI'd looked at his eyes, and I saw his eyes looked at this bottle top.
p146
aVAnd I'm doing this task here, and he's checking up.
p147
aVHis eyes are going back and forth up to me, to see what I'm looking at \u2014
p148
aVso we've got shared attention.
p149
aVAnd so I do this task, and he looks, and he looks to me
p150
aVto see what's happening next. And now I'll give him the bottle,
p151
aVand we'll see if he can do the task. Can you do that?
p152
aV(Laughter)
p153
aVOkay. He's pretty good. Yeah. Good, good, good.
p154
aVI didn't show you how to do that.
p155
aVNow see if you can put it back together.
p156
aV(Laughter)
p157
aVAnd he thinks a robot has to be really slow.
p158
aVGood robot, that's good.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo we saw a bunch of things there.
p161
aVWe saw when we're interacting,
p162
aVwe're trying to show someone how to do something, we direct their visual attention.
p163
aVThe other thing communicates their internal state to us,
p164
aVwhether he's understanding or not, regulates a social interaction.
p165
aVThere was shared attention looking at the same sort of thing,
p166
aVand recognizing socially communicated reinforcement at the end.
p167
aVAnd we've been trying to put that into our lab robots
p168
aVbecause we think this is how you're going to want to interact with robots in the future.
p169
aVI just want to show you one technical diagram here.
p170
aVThe most important thing for building a robot that you can interact with socially
p171
aVis its visual attention system.
p172
aVBecause what it pays attention to is what it's seeing
p173
aVand interacting with, and what you're understanding what it's doing.
p174
aVSo in the videos I'm about to show you,
p175
aVyou're going to see a visual attention system on a robot
p176
aVwhich has \u2014 it looks for skin tone in HSV space,
p177
aVso it works across all human colorings.
p178
aVIt looks for highly saturated colors, from toys.
p179
aVAnd it looks for things that move around.
p180
aVAnd it weights those together into an attention window,
p181
aVand it looks for the highest-scoring place \u2014
p182
aVthe stuff where the most interesting stuff is happening \u2014
p183
aVand that is what its eyes then segue to.
p184
aVAnd it looks right at that.
p185
aVAt the same time, some top-down sort of stuff:
p186
aVmight decide that it's lonely and look for skin tone,
p187
aVor might decide that it's bored and look for a toy to play with.
p188
aVAnd so these weights change.
p189
aa(lp190
VAnd over here on the right,
p191
aVthis is what we call the Steven Spielberg memorial module.
p192
aVDid people see the movie "AI"? (Audience: Yes.)
p193
aa(lp194
VRB: Yeah, it was really bad, but \u2014
p195
aa(lp196
Vremember, especially when Haley Joel Osment, the little robot,
p197
aVlooked at the blue fairy for 2,000 years without taking his eyes off it?
p198
aVWell, this gets rid of that,
p199
aVbecause this is a habituation Gaussian that gets negative,
p200
aVand more and more intense as it looks at one thing.
p201
aVAnd it gets bored, so it will then look away at something else.
p202
aVSo, once you've got that \u2014 and here's a robot, here's Kismet,
p203
aVlooking around for a toy. You can tell what it's looking at.
p204
aVYou can estimate its gaze direction from those eyeballs covering its camera,
p205
aVand you can tell when it's actually seeing the toy.
p206
aVAnd it's got a little bit of an emotional response here.
p207
aV(Laughter)
p208
aVBut it's still going to pay attention
p209
aVif something more significant comes into its field of view \u2014
p210
aVsuch as Cynthia Breazeal, the builder of this robot, from the right.
p211
aVIt sees her, pays attention to her.
p212
aVKismet has an underlying, three-dimensional emotional space,
p213
aVa vector space, of where it is emotionally.
p214
aVAnd at different places in that space, it expresses \u2014
p215
aVcan we have the volume on here?
p216
aVCan you hear that now, out there? (Audience: Yeah.)
p217
aa(lp218
VKismet: Do you really think so? Do you really think so?
p219
aVDo you really think so?
p220
aa(lp221
VRB: So it's expressing its emotion through its face
p222
aVand the prosody in its voice.
p223
aVAnd when I was dealing with my robot over here,
p224
aVChris, the robot, was measuring the prosody in my voice,
p225
aVand so we have the robot measure prosody for four basic messages
p226
aVthat mothers give their children pre-linguistically.
p227
aVHere we've got naive subjects praising the robot:
p228
aa(lp229
VVoice: Nice robot.
p230
aVYou're such a cute little robot.
p231
aV(Laughter)
p232
aVRB: And the robot's reacting appropriately.
p233
aa(lp234
VVoice: ...very good, Kismet.
p235
aV(Laughter)
p236
aa(lp237
VVoice: Look at my smile.
p238
aa(lp239
VRB: It smiles. She imitates the smile. This happens a lot.
p240
aVThese are naive subjects.
p241
aVHere we asked them to get the robot's attention
p242
aVand indicate when they have the robot's attention.
p243
aa(lp244
VVoice: Hey, Kismet, ah, there it is.
p245
aa(lp246
VRB: So she realizes she has the robot's attention.
p247
aVVoice: Kismet, do you like the toy? Oh.
p248
aa(lp249
VRB: Now, here they're asked to prohibit the robot,
p250
aVand this first woman really pushes the robot into an emotional corner.
p251
aa(lp252
VVoice: No. No. You're not to do that. No.
p253
aV(Laughter)
p254
aa(lp255
VNot appropriate. No. No.
p256
aV(Laughter)
p257
aa(lp258
VRB: I'm going to leave it at that.
p259
aa(lp260
VWe put that together. Then we put in turn taking.
p261
aVWhen we talk to someone, we talk.
p262
aVThen we sort of raise our eyebrows, move our eyes,
p263
aVgive the other person the idea it's their turn to talk.
p264
aVAnd then they talk, and then we pass the baton back and forth between each other.
p265
aVSo we put this in the robot.
p266
aVWe got a bunch of naive subjects in,
p267
aVwe didn't tell them anything about the robot,
p268
aVsat them down in front of the robot and said, talk to the robot.
p269
aVNow what they didn't know was,
p270
aVthe robot wasn't understanding a word they said,
p271
aVand that the robot wasn't speaking English.
p272
aVIt was just saying random English phonemes.
p273
aVAnd I want you to watch carefully, at the beginning of this,
p274
aVwhere this person, Ritchie, who happened to talk to the robot for 25 minutes \u2014
p275
aV(Laughter)
p276
aV\u2014 says, "I want to show you something.
p277
aVI want to show you my watch."
p278
aVAnd he brings the watch center, into the robot's field of vision,
p279
aVpoints to it, gives it a motion cue,
p280
aVand the robot looks at the watch quite successfully.
p281
aVWe don't know whether he understood or not that the robot \u2014
p282
aVNotice the turn-taking.
p283
aVRitchie: OK, I want to show you something. OK, this is a watch
p284
aVthat my girlfriend gave me.
p285
aVRobot: Oh, cool.
p286
aVRitchie: Yeah, look, it's got a little blue light in it too. I almost lost it this week.
p287
aV(Laughter)
p288
aVRB: So it's making eye contact with him, following his eyes.
p289
aVRitchie: Can you do the same thing? Robot: Yeah, sure.
p290
aVRB: And they successfully have that sort of communication.
p291
aa(lp292
VAnd here's another aspect of the sorts of things that Chris and I were doing.
p293
aVThis is another robot, Cog.
p294
aVThey first make eye contact, and then, when Christie looks over at this toy,
p295
aVthe robot estimates her gaze direction
p296
aVand looks at the same thing that she's looking at.
p297
aV(Laughter)
p298
aVSo we're going to see more and more of this sort of robot
p299
aVover the next few years in labs.
p300
aVBut then the big questions, two big questions that people ask me are:
p301
aVif we make these robots more and more human-like,
p302
aVwill we accept them, will we \u2014 will they need rights eventually?
p303
aVAnd the other question people ask me is, will they want to take over?
p304
aV(Laughter)
p305
aVAnd on the first \u2014 you know, this has been a very Hollywood theme
p306
aVwith lots of movies. You probably recognize these characters here \u2014
p307
aVwhere in each of these cases, the robots want more respect.
p308
aVWell, do you ever need to give robots respect?
p309
aVThey're just machines, after all.
p310
aVBut I think, you know, we have to accept that we are just machines.
p311
aVAfter all, that's certainly what modern molecular biology says about us.
p312
aVYou don't see a description of how, you know,
p313
aVMolecule A, you know, comes up and docks with this other molecule.
p314
aVAnd it's moving forward, you know, propelled by various charges,
p315
aVand then the soul steps in and tweaks those molecules so that they connect.
p316
aVIt's all mechanistic. We are mechanism.
p317
aVIf we are machines, then in principle at least,
p318
aVwe should be able to build machines out of other stuff,
p319
aVwhich are just as alive as we are.
p320
aVBut I think for us to admit that,
p321
aVwe have to give up on our special-ness, in a certain way.
p322
aVAnd we've had the retreat from special-ness
p323
aVunder the barrage of science and technology many times
p324
aVover the last few hundred years, at least.
p325
aV500 years ago we had to give up the idea
p326
aVthat we are the center of the universe
p327
aVwhen the earth started to go around the sun;
p328
aV150 years ago, with Darwin, we had to give up the idea we were different from animals.
p329
aVAnd to imagine \u2014 you know, it's always hard for us.
p330
aVRecently we've been battered with the idea that maybe
p331
aVwe didn't even have our own creation event, here on earth,
p332
aVwhich people didn't like much. And then the human genome said,
p333
aVmaybe we only have 35,000 genes. And that was really \u2014
p334
aVpeople didn't like that, we've got more genes than that.
p335
aVWe don't like to give up our special-ness, so, you know,
p336
aVhaving the idea that robots could really have emotions,
p337
aVor that robots could be living creatures \u2014
p338
aVI think is going to be hard for us to accept.
p339
aVBut we're going to come to accept it over the next 50 years or so.
p340
aa(lp341
VAnd the second question is, will the machines want to take over?
p342
aVAnd here the standard scenario is that we create these things,
p343
aVthey grow, we nurture them, they learn a lot from us,
p344
aVand then they start to decide that we're pretty boring, slow.
p345
aVThey want to take over from us.
p346
aVAnd for those of you that have teenagers, you know what that's like.
p347
aV(Laughter)
p348
aVBut Hollywood extends it to the robots.
p349
aVAnd the question is, you know,
p350
aVwill someone accidentally build a robot that takes over from us?
p351
aVAnd that's sort of like this lone guy in the backyard,
p352
aVyou know \u2014 "I accidentally built a 747."
p353
aVI don't think that's going to happen.
p354
aVAnd I don't think \u2014
p355
aV(Laughter)
p356
aV\u2014 I don't think we're going to deliberately build robots
p357
aVthat we're uncomfortable with.
p358
aVWe'll \u2014 you know, they're not going to have a super bad robot.
p359
aVBefore that has to come to be a mildly bad robot,
p360
aVand before that a not so bad robot.
p361
aV(Laughter)
p362
aVAnd we're just not going to let it go that way.
p363
aV(Laughter)
p364
aVSo, I think I'm going to leave it at that: the robots are coming,
p365
aVwe don't have too much to worry about, it's going to be a lot of fun,
p366
aVand I hope you all enjoy the journey over the next 50 years.

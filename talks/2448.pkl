VSo a few years ago,
p5
aVI did something really brave,
p6
aVor some would say really stupid.
p7
aVI ran for Congress.
p8
aa(lp9
VFor years, I had existed safely behind the scenes in politics
p10
aVas a fundraiser, as an organizer,
p11
aVbut in my heart, I always wanted to run.
p12
aVThe sitting congresswoman had been in my district since 1992.
p13
aVShe had never lost a race,
p14
aVand no one had really even run against her in a Democratic primary.
p15
aVBut in my mind, this was my way
p16
aVto make a difference,
p17
aVto disrupt the status quo.
p18
aVThe polls, however, told a very different story.
p19
aVMy pollsters told me that I was crazy to run,
p20
aVthat there was no way that I could win.
p21
aa(lp22
VBut I ran anyway,
p23
aVand in 2012, I became an upstart in a New York City congressional race.
p24
aVI swore I was going to win.
p25
aVI had the endorsement from the New York Daily News,
p26
aVthe Wall Street Journal snapped pictures of me on election day,
p27
aVand CNBC called it one of the hottest races in the country.
p28
aVI raised money from everyone I knew,
p29
aVincluding Indian aunties
p30
aVthat were just so happy an Indian girl was running.
p31
aVBut on election day, the polls were right,
p32
aVand I only got 19 percent of the vote,
p33
aVand the same papers that said I was a rising political star
p34
aVnow said I wasted 1.3 million dollars
p35
aVon 6,321 votes.
p36
aVDon't do the math.
p37
aVIt was humiliating.
p38
aa(lp39
VNow, before you get the wrong idea,
p40
aVthis is not a talk about the importance of failure.
p41
aVNor is it about leaning in.
p42
aVI tell you the story of how I ran for Congress
p43
aVbecause I was 33 years old
p44
aVand it was the first time in my entire life
p45
aVthat I had done something that was truly brave,
p46
aVwhere I didn't worry about being perfect.
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd I'm not alone:
p49
aVso many women I talk to tell me
p50
aVthat they gravitate towards careers and professions
p51
aVthat they know they're going to be great in,
p52
aVthat they know they're going to be perfect in,
p53
aVand it's no wonder why.
p54
aVMost girls are taught to avoid risk and failure.
p55
aVWe're taught to smile pretty,
p56
aVplay it safe, get all A's.
p57
aVBoys, on the other hand,
p58
aVare taught to play rough, swing high,
p59
aVcrawl to the top of the monkey bars and then just jump off headfirst.
p60
aVAnd by the time they're adults,
p61
aVwhether they're negotiating a raise or even asking someone out on a date,
p62
aVthey're habituated to take risk after risk.
p63
aVThey're rewarded for it.
p64
aVIt's often said in Silicon Valley,
p65
aVno one even takes you seriously unless you've had two failed start-ups.
p66
aVIn other words,
p67
aVwe're raising our girls to be perfect,
p68
aVand we're raising our boys to be brave.
p69
aa(lp70
VSome people worry about our federal deficit,
p71
aVbut I, I worry about our bravery deficit.
p72
aVOur economy, our society, we're just losing out
p73
aVbecause we're not raising our girls to be brave.
p74
aVThe bravery deficit is why women are underrepresented in STEM,
p75
aVin C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress,
p76
aVand pretty much everywhere you look.
p77
aa(lp78
VIn the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck
p79
aVlooked at how bright fifth graders handled an assignment
p80
aVthat was too difficult for them.
p81
aVShe found that bright girls were quick to give up.
p82
aVThe higher the IQ, the more likely they were to give up.
p83
aVBright boys, on the other hand,
p84
aVfound the difficult material to be a challenge.
p85
aVThey found it energizing.
p86
aVThey were more likely to redouble their efforts.
p87
aa(lp88
VWhat's going on?
p89
aVWell, at the fifth grade level,
p90
aVgirls routinely outperform boys in every subject,
p91
aVincluding math and science,
p92
aVso it's not a question of ability.
p93
aVThe difference is in how boys and girls approach a challenge.
p94
aVAnd it doesn't just end in fifth grade.
p95
aVAn HP report found that men will apply for a job
p96
aVif they meet only 60 percent of the qualifications,
p97
aVbut women, women will apply
p98
aVonly if they meet 100 percent of the qualifications.
p99
aV100 percent.
p100
aVThis study is usually invoked as evidence that, well,
p101
aVwomen need a little more confidence.
p102
aVBut I think it's evidence
p103
aVthat women have been socialized to aspire to perfection,
p104
aVand they're overly cautious.
p105
aa(lp106
V(Applause)
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd even when we're ambitious,
p109
aVeven when we're leaning in,
p110
aVthat socialization of perfection
p111
aVhas caused us to take less risks in our careers.
p112
aVAnd so those 600,000 jobs that are open right now
p113
aVin computing and tech,
p114
aVwomen are being left behind,
p115
aVand it means our economy is being left behind
p116
aVon all the innovation and problems women would solve
p117
aVif they were socialized to be brave
p118
aVinstead of socialized to be perfect.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Applause)
p121
aa(lp122
VSo in 2012, I started a company to teach girls to code,
p123
aVand what I found is that by teaching them to code
p124
aVI had socialized them to be brave.
p125
aVCoding, it's an endless process of trial and error,
p126
aVof trying to get the right command in the right place,
p127
aVwith sometimes just a semicolon
p128
aVmaking the difference between success and failure.
p129
aVCode breaks and then it falls apart,
p130
aVand it often takes many, many tries
p131
aVuntil that magical moment
p132
aVwhen what you're trying to build comes to life.
p133
aVIt requires perseverance.
p134
aVIt requires imperfection.
p135
aa(lp136
VWe immediately see in our program
p137
aVour girls' fear of not getting it right,
p138
aVof not being perfect.
p139
aVEvery Girls Who Code teacher tells me the same story.
p140
aVDuring the first week, when the girls are learning how to code,
p141
aVa student will call her over and she'll say,
p142
aV"I don't know what code to write."
p143
aVThe teacher will look at her screen,
p144
aVand she'll see a blank text editor.
p145
aVIf she didn't know any better, she'd think that her student
p146
aVspent the past 20 minutes just staring at the screen.
p147
aVBut if she presses undo a few times,
p148
aVshe'll see that her student wrote code and then deleted it.
p149
aVShe tried, she came close,
p150
aVbut she didn't get it exactly right.
p151
aVInstead of showing the progress that she made,
p152
aVshe'd rather show nothing at all.
p153
aVPerfection or bust.
p154
aa(lp155
VIt turns out that our girls are really good at coding,
p156
aVbut it's not enough just to teach them to code.
p157
aa(lp158
VMy friend Lev Brie, who is a professor at the University of Columbia
p159
aVand teaches intro to Java
p160
aVtells me about his office hours with computer science students.
p161
aVWhen the guys are struggling with an assignment,
p162
aVthey'll come in and they'll say,
p163
aV"Professor, there's something wrong with my code."
p164
aVThe girls will come in and say,
p165
aV"Professor, there's something wrong with me."
p166
aa(lp167
VWe have to begin to undo the socialization of perfection,
p168
aVbut we've got to combine it with building a sisterhood
p169
aVthat lets girls know that they are not alone.
p170
aVBecause trying harder is not going to fix a broken system.
p171
aVI can't tell you how many women tell me,
p172
aa(lp173
V"I'm afraid to raise my hand,
p174
aVI'm afraid to ask a question,
p175
aVbecause I don't want to be the only one
p176
aVwho doesn't understand,
p177
aVthe only one who is struggling.
p178
aVWhen we teach girls to be brave
p179
aVand we have a supportive network cheering them on,
p180
aVthey will build incredible things,
p181
aVand I see this every day.
p182
aVTake, for instance, two of our high school students
p183
aVwho built a game called Tampon Run \u2014
p184
aVyes, Tampon Run \u2014
p185
aVto fight against the menstruation taboo
p186
aVand sexism in gaming.
p187
aVOr the Syrian refugee
p188
aVwho dared show her love for her new country
p189
aVby building an app to help Americans get to the polls.
p190
aVOr a 16-year-old girl who built an algorithm
p191
aVto help detect whether a cancer is benign or malignant
p192
aVin the off chance that she can save her daddy's life
p193
aVbecause he has cancer.
p194
aVThese are just three examples of thousands,
p195
aVthousands of girls who have been socialized to be imperfect,
p196
aVwho have learned to keep trying, who have learned perseverance.
p197
aVAnd whether they become coders
p198
aVor the next Hillary Clinton or Beyoncé,
p199
aVthey will not defer their dreams.
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd those dreams have never been more important for our country.
p202
aVFor the American economy, for any economy to grow,
p203
aVto truly innovate,
p204
aVwe cannot leave behind half our population.
p205
aVWe have to socialize our girls to be comfortable with imperfection,
p206
aVand we've got to do it now.
p207
aVWe cannot wait for them to learn how to be brave like I did
p208
aVwhen I was 33 years old.
p209
aVWe have to teach them to be brave in schools
p210
aVand early in their careers,
p211
aVwhen it has the most potential to impact their lives
p212
aVand the lives of others,
p213
aVand we have to show them that they will be loved and accepted
p214
aVnot for being perfect
p215
aVbut for being courageous.
p216
aVAnd so I need each of you to tell every young woman you know \u2014
p217
aVyour sister, your niece, your employee, your colleague \u2014
p218
aVto be comfortable with imperfection,
p219
aVbecause when we teach girls to be imperfect,
p220
aVand we help them leverage it,
p221
aVwe will build a movement of young women who are brave
p222
aVand who will build a better world for themselves
p223
aVand for each and every one of us.
p224
aa(lp225
VThank you.
p226
aa(lp227
V(Applause)
p228
aVThank you.
p229
aa(lp230
VChris Anderson: Reshma, thank you.
p231
aVIt's such a powerful vision you have. You have a vision.
p232
aVTell me how it's going.
p233
aVHow many girls are involved now in your program?
p234
aa(lp235
VReshma Saujani: Yeah. So in 2012, we taught 20 girls.
p236
aVThis year we'll teach 40,000 in all 50 states.
p237
aa(lp238
V(Applause)
p239
aa(lp240
VAnd that number is really powerful,
p241
aVbecause last year we only graduated 7,500 women in computer science.
p242
aVLike, the problem is so bad
p243
aVthat we can make that type of change quickly.
p244
aa(lp245
VCA: And you're working with some of the companies in this room even,
p246
aVwho are welcoming graduates from your program?
p247
aa(lp248
VRS: Yeah, we have about 80 partners,
p249
aVfrom Twitter to Facebook
p250
aVto Adobe to IBM to Microsoft to Pixar to Disney,
p251
aVI mean, every single company out there.
p252
aVAnd if you're not signed up, I'm going to find you,
p253
aVbecause we need every single tech company
p254
aVto embed a Girls Who Code classroom in their office.
p255
aa(lp256
VCA: And you have some stories back from some of those companies
p257
aVthat when you mix in more gender balance
p258
aVin the engineering teams, good things happen.
p259
aa(lp260
VRS: Great things happen.
p261
aVI mean, I think that it's crazy to me to think about the fact
p262
aVthat right now 85 percent of all consumer purchases are made by women.
p263
aVWomen use social media at a rate of 600 percent more than men.
p264
aVWe own the Internet,
p265
aVand we should be building the companies of tomorrow.
p266
aVAnd I think when companies have diverse teams,
p267
aVand they have incredible women that are part of their engineering teams,
p268
aVthey build awesome things, and we see it every day.
p269
aa(lp270
VCA: Reshma, you saw the reaction there. You're doing incredibly important work.
p271
aVThis whole community is cheering you on. More power to you. Thank you.
p272
aa(lp273
VRS: Thank you.

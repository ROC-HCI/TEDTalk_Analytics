VHi everyone.
p5
aVI'm an artist and a dad \u2014 second time around.
p6
aVThank you.
p7
aVAnd I want to share with you my latest art project.
p8
aVIt's a children's book for the iPad.
p9
aVIt's a little quirky and silly.
p10
aVIt's called "Pop-It,"
p11
aVAnd it's about the things little kids do with their parents.
p12
aa(lp13
V(Music)
p14
aa(lp15
VSo this is about potty training \u2014
p16
aVas most of you, I hope, know.
p17
aVYou can tickle the rug.
p18
aVYou can make the baby poop.
p19
aVYou can do all those fun things.
p20
aVYou can burst bubbles.
p21
aVYou can draw, as everyone should.
p22
aa(lp23
VBut you know, I have a problem with children's books:
p24
aVI think they're full of propaganda.
p25
aVAt least an Indian trying to get one of these American books in Park Slope, forget it.
p26
aVIt's not the way I was brought up.
p27
aVSo I said, "I'm going to counter this with my own propaganda."
p28
aVIf you notice carefully,
p29
aVit's a homosexual couple bringing up a child.
p30
aVYou don't like it?
p31
aVShake it, and you have a lesbian couple.
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aVShake it, and you have a heterosexual couple.
p34
aVYou know, I don't even believe in the concept of an ideal family.
p35
aa(lp36
VI have to tell you about my childhood.
p37
aVI went to this very proper Christian school
p38
aVtaught by nuns, fathers, brothers, sisters.
p39
aVBasically, I was brought up to be a good Samaritan,
p40
aVand I am.
p41
aVAnd I'd go at the end of the day to a traditional Hindu house,
p42
aVwhich was probably the only Hindu house
p43
aVin a predominantly Islamic neighborhood.
p44
aVBasically, I celebrated every religious function.
p45
aVIn fact, when there was a wedding in our neighborhood,
p46
aVall of us would paint our houses for the wedding.
p47
aVI remember we cried profusely
p48
aVwhen the little goats we played with in the summer
p49
aVbecame biriani.
p50
aV(Laughter)
p51
aVWe all had to fast during Ramadan.
p52
aVIt was a very beautiful time.
p53
aa(lp54
VBut I must say,
p55
aVI'll never forget, when I was 13 years old, this happened.
p56
aVBabri Masjid \u2014
p57
aVone of the most beautiful mosques in India,
p58
aVbuilt by King Babur, I think, in the 16th century \u2014
p59
aVwas demolished by Hindu activists.
p60
aVThis caused major riots in my city.
p61
aVAnd for the first time,
p62
aVI was affected
p63
aVby this communal unrest.
p64
aVMy little five-year-old kid neighbor
p65
aVcomes running in,
p66
aVand he says, "Rags, Rags.
p67
aVYou know the Hindus are killing us Muslims. Be careful."
p68
aVI'm like, "Dude, I'm Hindu."
p69
aV(Laughter)
p70
aVHe's like, "Huh!"
p71
aa(lp72
VYou know, my work is inspired
p73
aVby events such as this.
p74
aVEven in my gallery shows,
p75
aVI try and revisit historic events
p76
aVlike Babri Masjid,
p77
aVdistill only its emotional residue
p78
aVand image my own life.
p79
aVImagine history being taught differently.
p80
aa(lp81
VRemember that children's book
p82
aVwhere you shake and the sexuality of the parents change?
p83
aVI have another idea.
p84
aVIt's a children's book about Indian independence \u2014
p85
aVvery patriotic.
p86
aVBut when you shake it, you get Pakistan's perspective.
p87
aVShake it again, and you get the British perspective.
p88
aa(lp89
V(Applause)
p90
aa(lp91
VYou have to separate fact from bias, right.
p92
aVEven my books on children
p93
aVhave cute, fuzzy animals.
p94
aVBut they're playing geopolitics.
p95
aVThey're playing out Israel-Palestine,
p96
aVIndia-Pakistan.
p97
aVYou know, I'm making a very important argument.
p98
aVAnd my argument [is]
p99
aVthat the only way for us to teach creativity
p100
aVis by teaching children perspectives
p101
aVat the earliest stage.
p102
aVAfter all, children's books are manuals on parenting,
p103
aVso you better give them children's books that teach them perspectives.
p104
aVAnd conversely,
p105
aVonly when you teach perspectives
p106
aVwill a child be able to imagine
p107
aVand put themselves in the shoes
p108
aVof someone who is different from them.
p109
aa(lp110
VI'm making an argument that art and creativity
p111
aVare very essential tools in empathy.
p112
aVYou know, I can't promise my child
p113
aVa life without bias \u2014
p114
aVwe're all biased \u2014
p115
aVbut I promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives.
p116
aa(lp117
VThank you very much.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Applause)

cartoonist, and the cartoonist&rsquo;s bold line -- and dead-on eye for truth -- still powers his art. His work spans painting, sculpture, installation, film and iPad art, always linked by his challenging opinions on identity, conformity, gender, celebrity, ceremony. (He even views his lavish Indian wedding as a piece of performance art.)</p><p>His early work as a painter made a complete break with his cartoon career -- he painted watercolors on canvas using only his hands and feet. Since then, his work has grown to knit together aesthetics from both worlds, as collage and complication play against flat color and precise lines. He shows in galleries and performance spaces around the world and often collaborates with other artists, most recently with musicians Paul Simon and Erykah Badu. &nbsp;In 2011, he launched his children&#39;s iPad book, <em>Pop-it</em>, shaking up the concept &nbsp;of an ideal family. He is currently working on a project that promises to shake up everything! From news to education.</p>", "slug": "kk_raghava", "whotheyare": "Raghava KK\'s paintings and drawings use cartoonish shapes and colors to examine the body, society, our world.

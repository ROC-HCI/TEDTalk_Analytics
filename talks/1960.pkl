VSo a chip, a poet and a boy.
p5
aa(lp6
VIt's just about 20 years ago,
p7
aVJune 1994, when Intel announced
p8
aVthat there was a flaw
p9
aVat the core of their Pentium chip.
p10
aVDeep in the code of the SRT algorithm
p11
aVto calculate intermediate quotients necessary
p12
aVfor iterative floating points of divisions \u2014
p13
aVI don't know what that means, but  it's what it says on Wikipedia \u2014
p14
aVthere was a flaw and an error
p15
aVthat meant that there was a certain probability
p16
aVthat the result of the calculation would be an error,
p17
aVand the probability was one out of every
p18
aV360 billion calculations.
p19
aVSo Intel said your average spreadsheet
p20
aVwould be flawed once every 27,000 years.
p21
aVThey didn't think it was significant,
p22
aVbut there was an outrage in the community.
p23
aVThe community, the techies, said, this flaw
p24
aVhas to be addressed.
p25
aVThey were not going to stand by quietly
p26
aVas Intel gave them these chips.
p27
aVSo there was a revolution across the world.
p28
aVPeople marched to demand \u2014
p29
aVokay, not really exactly like that \u2014
p30
aVbut they rose up and they demanded
p31
aVthat Intel fix the flaw.
p32
aVAnd Intel set aside 475 million dollars
p33
aVto fund the replacement of millions of chips
p34
aVto fix the flaw.
p35
aVSo billions of dollars in our society
p36
aVwas spent to address a problem
p37
aVwhich would come once out of every 360 billion
p38
aVcalculations.
p39
aa(lp40
VNumber two, a poet.
p41
aVThis is Martin Niemöller.
p42
aVYou're familiar with his poetry.
p43
aVAround the height of the Nazi period,
p44
aVhe started repeating the verse,
p45
aV"First they came for the communists,
p46
aVand I did nothing,
p47
aVdid not speak out because I was not a communist.
p48
aVThen they came for the socialists.
p49
aVThen they came for the trade unions.
p50
aVThen they came for the Jews.
p51
aVAnd then they came for me.
p52
aVBut there was no one left to speak for me."
p53
aVNow, Niemöller is offering a certain kind of insight.
p54
aVThis is an insight at the core of intelligence.
p55
aVWe could call it cluefulness.
p56
aVIt's a certain kind of test:
p57
aVCan you recognize
p58
aVan underlying threat and respond?
p59
aVCan you save yourself or save your kind?
p60
aVTurns out ants are pretty good at this.
p61
aVCows, not so much.
p62
aVSo can you see the pattern?
p63
aVCan you see a pattern and then recognize
p64
aVand do something about it? Number two.
p65
aVNumber three, a boy.
p66
aVThis is my friend Aaron Swartz.
p67
aVHe's Tim's friend.
p68
aVHe's friends of many of you in this audience,
p69
aVand seven years ago,
p70
aVAaron came to me with a question.
p71
aVIt was just before I was going to give my first TED Talk.
p72
aVI was so proud. I was telling him about my talk,
p73
aV"Laws that choke creativity."
p74
aVAnd Aaron looked at me
p75
aVand was a little impatient, and he said,
p76
aV"So how are you ever
p77
aVgoing to solve the problems you're talking about?
p78
aVCopyright policy, Internet policy,
p79
aVhow are you ever going to address those problems
p80
aVso long as there's this fundamental corruption
p81
aVin the way our government works?"
p82
aa(lp83
VSo I was a little put off by this.
p84
aVHe wasn't sharing in my celebration.
p85
aVAnd I said to him, "You know, Aaron,
p86
aVit's not my field, not my field."
p87
aa(lp88
VHe said, "You mean as an academic, it's not your field?"
p89
aa(lp90
VI said, "Yeah, as an academic, it's not my field."
p91
aa(lp92
VHe said, "What about as a citizen?
p93
aVAs a citizen."
p94
aa(lp95
VNow, this is the way Aaron was.
p96
aVHe didn't tell. He asked questions.
p97
aVBut his questions spoke as clearly
p98
aVas my four-year-old's hug.
p99
aVHe was saying to me,
p100
aV"You've got to get a clue.
p101
aVYou have got to get a clue, because there is
p102
aVa flaw at the core of the operating system
p103
aVof this democracy,
p104
aVand it's not a flaw every one out of 360 billion times
p105
aVour democracy tries to make a decision.
p106
aVIt is every time,
p107
aVevery single important issue.
p108
aVWe've got to end the bovinity of this political society.
p109
aVWe've got to adopt, it turns out,
p110
aVthe word is fourmi-formatic attitude \u2014
p111
aVthat's what the Internet tells me the word is \u2014
p112
aVthe ant's appreciative attitude
p113
aVthat gets us to recognize this flaw,
p114
aVsave our kind and save our demos.
p115
aa(lp116
VNow if you know Aaron Swartz,
p117
aVyou know that we lost him
p118
aVjust over a year ago.
p119
aVIt was about six weeks
p120
aVbefore I gave my TED Talk,
p121
aVand I was so grateful to Chris
p122
aVthat he asked me to give this TED Talk,
p123
aVnot because I had the chance to talk to you,
p124
aValthough that was great,
p125
aVbut because it pulled me out of an extraordinary depression.
p126
aVI couldn't begin to describe the sadness.
p127
aVBecause I had to focus.
p128
aVI had to focus on, what was I going to say to you?
p129
aVIt saved me.
p130
aa(lp131
VBut after the buzz, the excitement,
p132
aVthe power that comes from this community,
p133
aVI began to yearn for a less sterile,
p134
aVless academic way to address these issues,
p135
aVthe issues that I was talking about.
p136
aVWe'd begun to focus on New Hampshire
p137
aVas a target for this political movement,
p138
aVbecause the primary in New Hampshire
p139
aVis so incredibly important.
p140
aVIt was a group called the New Hampshire Rebellion
p141
aVthat was beginning to talk about, how would we make
p142
aVthis issue of this corruption central in 2016?
p143
aVBut it was another soul that caught my imagination,
p144
aVa woman named Doris Haddock, aka Granny D.
p145
aVOn January 1, 1999, 15 years ago,
p146
aVat the age of 88, Granny D started a walk.
p147
aVShe started in Los Angeles
p148
aVand began to walk to Washington, D.C.
p149
aVwith a single sign on her chest that said,
p150
aV"campaign finance reform."
p151
aVEighteen months later,
p152
aVat the age of 90,
p153
aVshe arrived in Washington with hundreds following her,
p154
aVincluding many congressmen who had gotten in a car
p155
aVand driven out about a mile outside of the city
p156
aVto walk in with her.
p157
aV(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VNow, I don't have 13 months
p160
aVto walk across the country.
p161
aVI've got three kids who hate to walk,
p162
aVand a wife who, it turns out,
p163
aVstill hates when I'm not there
p164
aVfor mysterious reasons,
p165
aVso this was not an option,
p166
aVbut the question I asked,
p167
aVcould we remix Granny D a bit?
p168
aVWhat about a walk not of 3,200 miles
p169
aVbut of 185 miles across New Hampshire
p170
aVin January?
p171
aa(lp172
VSo on January 11,
p173
aVthe anniversary of Aaron's death,
p174
aVwe began a walk that ended on January 24th,
p175
aVthe day that Granny D was born.
p176
aVA total of 200 people joined us across this walk,
p177
aVas we went from the very top to the very bottom of New Hampshire
p178
aVtalking about this issue.
p179
aVAnd what was astonishing to me,
p180
aVsomething I completely did not expect to find,
p181
aVwas the passion and anger
p182
aVthat there was among everyone that we talked to about this issue.
p183
aVWe had found in a poll that 96 percent of Americans
p184
aVbelieve it important to reduce the influence
p185
aVof money in politics.
p186
aVNow politicians and pundits tell you,
p187
aVthere's nothing we can do about this issue,
p188
aVAmericans don't care about it,
p189
aVbut the reason for that is
p190
aVthat 91 percent of Americans
p191
aVthink there's nothing that can be done about this issue.
p192
aVAnd it's this gap between 96 and 91
p193
aVthat explains our politics of resignation.
p194
aVI mean, after all, at least 96 percent of us
p195
aVwish we could fly like Superman,
p196
aVbut because at least 91 percent of us believe we can't,
p197
aVwe don't leap off of tall buildings every time
p198
aVwe have that urge.
p199
aVThat's because we accept our limits,
p200
aVand so too with this reform.
p201
aVBut when you give people the sense of hope,
p202
aVyou begin to thaw that absolute sense of impossibility.
p203
aVAs Harvey Milk said, if you give 'em hope,
p204
aVyou give 'em a chance, a way to think
p205
aVabout how this change is possible.
p206
aVHope.
p207
aVAnd hope is the one thing that we, Aaron's friends,
p208
aVfailed him with, because we let him
p209
aVlose that sense of hope.
p210
aVI loved that boy like I love my son.
p211
aVBut we failed him.
p212
aVAnd I love my country,
p213
aVand I'm not going to fail that.
p214
aVI'm not going to fail that.
p215
aVThat sense of hope, we're going to hold,
p216
aVand we're going to fight for,
p217
aVhowever impossible this battle looks.
p218
aa(lp219
VWhat's next?
p220
aVWell, we started with this march with 200 people,
p221
aVand next year, there will be 1,000
p222
aVon different routes
p223
aVthat march in the month of January
p224
aVand meet in Concord to celebrate this cause,
p225
aVand then in 2016, before the primary,
p226
aVthere will be 10,000 who march across that state,
p227
aVmeeting in Concord to celebrate this cause.
p228
aVAnd as we have marched, people around the country
p229
aVhave begun to say, "Can we do the same thing
p230
aVin our state?"
p231
aVSo we've started a platform called G.D. Walkers,
p232
aVthat is, Granny D walkers,
p233
aVand Granny D walkers across the country
p234
aVwill be marching for this reform. Number one.
p235
aVNumber two, on this march,
p236
aVone of the founders of Thunderclap, David Cascino,
p237
aVwas with us,
p238
aVand he said, "Well what can we do?"
p239
aVAnd so they developed a platform,
p240
aVwhich we are announcing today,
p241
aVthat allows us to pull together voters
p242
aVwho are committed to this idea of reform.
p243
aVRegardless of where you are,
p244
aVin New Hampshire or outside of New Hampshire,
p245
aVyou can sign up and directly be informed
p246
aVwhere the candidates are on this issue
p247
aVso you can decide who to vote for
p248
aVas a function of which is going
p249
aVto make this possibility real.
p250
aVAnd then finally number three, the hardest.
p251
aVWe're in the age of the Super PAC.
p252
aVIndeed yesterday, Merriam announced
p253
aVthat Merriam-Webster will have Super PAC as a word.
p254
aVIt is now an official word in the dictionary.
p255
aVSo on May 1, aka May Day,
p256
aVwe're going to try an experiment.
p257
aVWe're going to try a launching
p258
aVof what we can think of as a Super PAC
p259
aVto end all Super PACs.
p260
aVAnd the basic way this works is this.
p261
aVFor the last year, we have been working
p262
aVwith analysts and political experts
p263
aVto calculate, how much would it cost
p264
aVto win enough votes in the United States Congress
p265
aVto make fundamental reform possible?
p266
aVWhat is that number? Half a billion? A billion?
p267
aVWhat is that number?
p268
aVAnd then whatever that number is,
p269
aVwe are going to kickstart, sort of,
p270
aVbecause you can't use KickStarter for political work,
p271
aVbut anyway, kickstart, sort of,
p272
aVfirst a bottom-up campaign
p273
aVwhere people will make small dollar commitments
p274
aVcontingent on reaching very ambitious goals,
p275
aVand when those goals have been reached,
p276
aVwe will turn to the large dollar contributors,
p277
aVto get them to contribute to make it possible
p278
aVfor us to run the kind of Super PAC necessary
p279
aVto win this issue,
p280
aVto change the way money influences politics,
p281
aVso that on November 8,
p282
aVwhich I discovered yesterday is the day
p283
aVthat Aaron would have been 30 years old,
p284
aVon November 8,
p285
aVwe will celebrate 218 representatives
p286
aVin the House and 60 Senators
p287
aVin the United States Senate
p288
aVwho have committed to this idea
p289
aVof fundamental reform.
p290
aa(lp291
VSo last night, we heard about wishes.
p292
aVHere's my wish.
p293
aVMay one.
p294
aVMay the ideals of one boy
p295
aVunite one nation behind one critical idea
p296
aVthat we are one people,
p297
aVwe are the people who were promised a government,
p298
aVa government that was promised to be
p299
aVdependent upon the people alone, the people,
p300
aVwho, as Madison told us,
p301
aVmeant not the rich more than the poor.
p302
aVMay one.
p303
aVAnd then may you, may you join this movement,
p304
aVnot because you're a politician,
p305
aVnot because you're an expert,
p306
aVnot because this is your field,
p307
aVbut because if you are,
p308
aVyou are a citizen.
p309
aVAaron asked me that.
p310
aVNow I've asked you.
p311
aa(lp312
VThank you very much.

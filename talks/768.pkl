(lp4
VSomeone once said that politics is, of course, "showbiz for ugly people."
p5
aVSo, on that basis, I feel like I've really arrived.
p6
aVThe other thing to think of is what an honor it is, as a politician,
p7
aVto give a TED talk, particularly here in the U.K.,
p8
aVwhere the reputation of politics, with the expenses scandal, has sunk so low.
p9
aa(lp10
VThere was even a story recently that scientists had thought about
p11
aVactually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians.
p12
aVAnd someone asked,"Why?"
p13
aVand they said, "Well, there's no shortage of politicians,
p14
aVno one really minds what happens to them
p15
aVand, after all, there are some things that rats just won't do."
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VNow, I know you all love data, so I'm starting with a data-rich slide.
p19
aVThis, I think, is the most important fact to bear in mind
p20
aVin British politics or American politics,
p21
aVand that is: We have run out of money.
p22
aVWe have vast budget deficits.
p23
aVThis is my global public debt clock,
p24
aVand, as you can see, it's 32 trillion and counting.
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd I think what this leads to
p27
aVis a very simple recognition,
p28
aVthat there's one question in politics at the moment above all other,
p29
aVand it's this one: How do we make things better without spending more money?
p30
aVBecause there isn't going to be a lot of money to improve public services,
p31
aVor to improve government, or to improve so many of the things
p32
aVthat politicians talk about.
p33
aVSo what follows from that is that if you think it's all about money \u2014
p34
aVyou can only measure success in public services
p35
aVin health care and education and policing by spending more money,
p36
aVyou can only measure progress by spending money \u2014
p37
aVyou're going to have a pretty miserable time.
p38
aa(lp39
VBut if you think a whole lot of other things matter that lead up to well being \u2014
p40
aVthings like your family relationships, friendship, community, values \u2014
p41
aVthen, actually, this is an incredibly exciting time to be in politics.
p42
aVAnd the really simple argument I want to make tonight,
p43
aVthe really straightforward argument is this:
p44
aVThat if we combine the right political philosophy, the right political thinking,
p45
aVwith the incredible information revolution that has taken place,
p46
aVand that all of you know so much more about than I do,
p47
aVI think there's an incredible opportunity to actually remake politics,
p48
aVremake government, remake public services,
p49
aVand achieve what's up on that slide, which is a big increase in our well-being.
p50
aVThat's the argument I want to make tonight.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo, starting with the political philosophy.
p53
aVNow I'm not saying for a minute that British Conservatives have all the answers.
p54
aVOf course we don't.
p55
aVBut there are two things at heart that I think drive a conservative philosophy
p56
aVthat are really relevant to this whole debate.
p57
aVThe first is this: We believe that if you give people
p58
aVmore power and control over their lives,
p59
aVif you give people more choice,
p60
aVif you put them in the driving seat,
p61
aVthen actually, you can create a stronger and better society.
p62
aVAnd if you marry this fact with the incredible abundance
p63
aVof information that we have in our world today,
p64
aVI think you can completely, as I've said,
p65
aVremake politics, remake government, remake your public services.
p66
aa(lp67
VThe second thing we believe is we believe in going with the grain of human nature.
p68
aVPolitics and politicians will only succeed
p69
aVif they actually try and treat with people as they are,
p70
aVrather than as they would like them to be.
p71
aVNow, if you combine this very simple, very conservative thought \u2014
p72
aVgo with the grain of human nature \u2014
p73
aVwith all the advances in behavioral economics,
p74
aVsome of which we were just hearing about,
p75
aVagain, I think we can achieve a real increase in well-being,
p76
aVin happiness, in a stronger society
p77
aVwithout necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money.
p78
aa(lp79
VNow, why do I think now is the moment to make this argument?
p80
aVWell, I'm afraid you're going to suffer a short, condensed history lesson
p81
aVabout what I would say are the three passages of history:
p82
aVthe pre-bureaucratic age, the bureaucratic age
p83
aVand what we now live in, which I think is a post-bureaucratic age.
p84
aVA simpler way of thinking of it
p85
aVis that we have gone from a world of local control,
p86
aVthen we went to a world of central control,
p87
aVand now we're in a world of people control.
p88
aVLocal power, central power, now, people power.
p89
aa(lp90
VNow, here is King Cnut, king a thousand years ago.
p91
aVThought he could turn back the waves; couldn't turn back the waves.
p92
aVCouldn't actually turn back very much,
p93
aVbecause if you were king a thousand years ago,
p94
aVwhile it still took hours and hours and weeks and weeks to traverse your own country,
p95
aVthere wasn't much you were in charge of.
p96
aVYou weren't in charge of policing, justice, education, health, welfare.
p97
aVYou could just about go to war and that was about it.
p98
aVThis was the pre-bureaucratic age,
p99
aVan age in which everything had to be local.
p100
aVYou had to have local control because there was no nationally-available information
p101
aVbecause travel was so restricted.
p102
aVSo this was the pre-bureaucratic age.
p103
aa(lp104
VNext part of the cold history lesson,
p105
aVthe lovely picture of the British Industrial Revolution.
p106
aVSuddenly, all sorts of transport, travel information were possible,
p107
aVand this gave birth to, what I like to call, the bureaucratic age.
p108
aVAnd hopefully this slide is going to morph beautifully. There we are.
p109
aVSuddenly, you have the big, strong, central state.
p110
aVIt was able \u2014 but only it was able \u2014 to organize
p111
aVhealth care, education, policing, justice.
p112
aVAnd it was a world of, as I say, not local power, but now central power.
p113
aVIt had sucked all that power up from the localities.
p114
aVIt was able to do that itself.
p115
aa(lp116
VThe next great stage, which all of you are so familiar with:
p117
aVthe massive information revolution.
p118
aVJust consider this one fact:
p119
aVOne hundred years ago, sending these 10 words cost 50 dollars.
p120
aVRight now, here we are linked up to Long Beach and everywhere else,
p121
aVand all these secret locations for a fraction of that cost,
p122
aVand we can send and receive huge quantities of information
p123
aVwithout it costing anything.
p124
aVSo we're now living in a post-bureaucratic age,
p125
aVwhere genuine people power is possible.
p126
aa(lp127
VNow, what does this mean for our politics,
p128
aVfor our public services, for our government?
p129
aVWell I can't, in the time I've got, give huge numbers of examples,
p130
aVbut let me just give a few of the ways that life can change.
p131
aVAnd this is so obvious, in a way, because
p132
aVyou think about how all of you have changed
p133
aVthe way we shop, the way we travel, the way that business is done.
p134
aVThat is already happened; the information and Internet revolution
p135
aVhas actually gone all the way through our societies in so many different ways,
p136
aVbut it hasn't, in every way, yet touched our government.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo, how could this happen?
p139
aVWell, I think there are three chief ways that it should make an enormous difference:
p140
aVin transparency, in greater choice and in accountability,
p141
aVin giving us that genuine people power.
p142
aVIf we take transparency, here is one of my favorite websites,
p143
aVthe Missouri Accountability Portal.
p144
aVIn the old days, only the government could hold the information,
p145
aVand only a few elected people could try and grab that information
p146
aVand question it and challenge it.
p147
aVNow here, on one website, one state in America,
p148
aVevery single dollar spent by that government
p149
aVis searchable, is analyzable, is checkable.
p150
aa(lp151
VThink of the huge change that means:
p152
aVAny business that wants to bid for a government contract
p153
aVcan see what currently is being spent.
p154
aVAnyone thinking, "I could do that service better, I could deliver it cheaper,"
p155
aVit's all available there.
p156
aVWe have only, in government and in politics,
p157
aVstarted to scratch the surface of what people are doing in the commercial world
p158
aVwith the information revolution.
p159
aVSo, complete transparency will make a huge difference.
p160
aVIn this country, if we win the election,
p161
aVwe are going to make all government spending over 25,000 pounds
p162
aVtransparent and available online, searchable for anyone to see.
p163
aVWe're going to make every contract \u2014 we're announcing this today \u2014
p164
aVavailable on the Internet so anyone can see
p165
aVwhat the terms are, what the conditions are,
p166
aVdriving huge value for money,
p167
aVbut also huge increases, I believe, in well-being as well.
p168
aa(lp169
VChoice. Now you all shop online, compare online, do everything online,
p170
aVand yet this revolution has hardly touched the surface
p171
aVof public services like education, or health care or policing,
p172
aVand you're going to see this change massively.
p173
aVWe should be making this change
p174
aVwith the information revolution in our country,
p175
aVwith searchable health sites, so you can see what operations work out properly,
p176
aVwhat records doctors have, the cleanliness of hospitals,
p177
aVwho does best at infection control \u2014
p178
aVall of the information that would once be locked in the Department of Health
p179
aVis now available for all of us to see.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd the third of these big changes: accountability.
p182
aVThis, I think, is a huge change.
p183
aVIt is a crime map. This is a crime map from Chicago.
p184
aVSo, instead of having a situation where only the police have the information
p185
aVabout which crimes are committed where,
p186
aVand we have to employ people in government
p187
aVto try and hold the police to account,
p188
aVsuddenly, we've got this vast opportunity for people power,
p189
aVwhere we, as citizens, can see what crimes are being committed \u2014
p190
aVwhere, when and by whom \u2014
p191
aVand we can hold the police to account.
p192
aVAnd you can see this looks a bit like a chef's hat,
p193
aVbut actually that's an assault, the one in blue.
p194
aVYou can see what crime is committed where,
p195
aVand you have the opportunity to hold your police force to account.
p196
aVSo those three ways \u2014 transparency, accountability and choice \u2014
p197
aVwill make a huge difference.
p198
aa(lp199
VNow I also said the other principle
p200
aVthat I think we should work on is understanding of people,
p201
aVis recognizing that going with the grain of human nature
p202
aVyou can achieve so much more.
p203
aVNow, we're got a huge revolution in understanding
p204
aVof why people behave in the way that they do,
p205
aVand a great opportunity to put that knowledge and information to greater use.
p206
aVWe're working with some of these people.
p207
aVWe're being advised by some of these people, as was said,
p208
aVto try and bring all the experience to book.
p209
aa(lp210
VLet me just give you one example that I think is incredibly simple, and I love.
p211
aVWe want to get people to be more energy efficient.
p212
aVWhy? It cuts fuel poverty, it cuts their bills,
p213
aVand it cuts carbon emissions at the same time.
p214
aVHow do you do it?
p215
aVWell, we've had government information campaigns over the years
p216
aVwhen they tell you to switch off the lights when you leave the home.
p217
aVWe even had \u2014 one government minister once told us to
p218
aVbrush our teeth in the dark.
p219
aVI don't think they lasted very long.
p220
aVLook at what this does. This is a simple piece of behavioral economics.
p221
aVThe best way to get someone to cut their electricity bill
p222
aVis to show them their own spending,
p223
aVto show them what their neighbors are spending,
p224
aVand then show what an energy conscious neighbor is spending.
p225
aVThat sort of behavioral economics
p226
aVcan transform people's behavior
p227
aVin a way that all the bullying and all the information
p228
aVand all the badgering from a government cannot possibly achieve.
p229
aVOther examples are recycling.
p230
aVWe all know we need to recycle more.
p231
aVHow do we make it happen?
p232
aVAll the proof from America is that actually, if you pay people to recycle,
p233
aVif you give them a carrot rather than a stick,
p234
aVyou can transform their behavior.
p235
aa(lp236
VSo what does all this add up to?
p237
aVHere are my two favorite U.S. speeches of the last 50 years.
p238
aVObviously, here we have JFK with that incredibly simple
p239
aVand powerful formulation,
p240
aV"Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country,"
p241
aVan incredibly noble sentiment.
p242
aVBut when he made that speech, what could you do
p243
aVto build the stronger, better society?
p244
aVYou could fight for your country, you could die for your country,
p245
aVyou could serve in your country's civil service,
p246
aVbut you didn't really have the information and the knowledge
p247
aVand the ability to help build the stronger society in the way that you do now.
p248
aa(lp249
VAnd I think an even more wonderful speech,
p250
aVwhich I'm going to read a big chunk of,
p251
aVwhich sums up what I said at the beginning
p252
aVabout believing there is more to life than money,
p253
aVand more that we should try and measure than money.
p254
aVAnd it is Robert Kennedy's beautiful description
p255
aVof why gross national product captures so little:
p256
aVIt "does not allow for the health of our children,
p257
aVthe quality of their education, or the joy of their play.
p258
aVIt does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages,
p259
aVthe intelligence of our public debate.
p260
aVIt measures neither our wit nor our courage,
p261
aVneither our wisdom nor our learning,
p262
aVneither our compassion nor our devotion to our country.
p263
aVIt measures everything, in short,
p264
aVexcept that which makes life worthwhile."
p265
aa(lp266
VAgain, a sentiment that was so noble and beautifully put 40 years ago,
p267
aVand a beautiful dream 40 years ago,
p268
aVbut now with the huge advances in information technology,
p269
aVwith the massive changes in behavioral economics,
p270
aVwith all that we know about how you advance well-being,
p271
aVthat if we combine those insights
p272
aVof giving power to people, and using information to make that possible,
p273
aVand using the insight of going with the grain of human nature,
p274
aVwhile at the same time, understanding why people behave in the way they do,
p275
aVit is a dream more easy to realize today
p276
aVthan it was when it was made in that beautiful speech 40 years ago.
p277
aa(lp278
VThank you.

(lp4
V(Arabic) I seek refuge in Allah from cursed Satan. In the Name of Allah, the most Gracious, the most Merciful.
p5
aa(lp6
V(English) I was born in a middle class family.
p7
aVMy father was five years old when he lost his father,
p8
aVbut by the time I was born,
p9
aVhe was already a businessman.
p10
aVBut it didn't make a difference to him
p11
aVif his children were going to be a boy or a girl:
p12
aVthey were going to go to school.
p13
aVSo I guess I was the lucky one.
p14
aa(lp15
VMy mother had 16 pregnancies.
p16
aVFrom 16 pregnancies, five of us are alive.
p17
aVYou can imagine as a child what I went through.
p18
aVDay to day, I watched women
p19
aVbeing carried to a graveyard,
p20
aVor watched children going to a graveyard.
p21
aVAt that time, when I finished my high school,
p22
aVI really wanted to be a doctor.
p23
aVI wanted to be a doctor to help women and children.
p24
aVSo I completed my education,
p25
aVbut I wanted to go to university.
p26
aVUnfortunately, in my country, there wasn't a dormitory for girls,
p27
aVso I was accepted in medical school, but I could not go there.
p28
aVSo as a result, my father sent me to America.
p29
aa(lp30
VI came to America.
p31
aVI completed my education.
p32
aVWhile I was completing my education,
p33
aVmy country was invaded by Russia.
p34
aVAnd do you know that at the time I was completing my education,
p35
aVI didn't know what was going on with my family or with my country.
p36
aVThere were months, years, I didn't know about it.
p37
aVMy family was in a refugee camp.
p38
aVSo as soon as I completed my education,
p39
aVI brought my family to America.
p40
aVI wanted them to be safe.
p41
aa(lp42
VBut where was my heart?
p43
aVMy heart was in Afghanistan.
p44
aVDay after day, when I listened to the news,
p45
aVwhen I followed what was going on with my country,
p46
aVmy heart was breaking up.
p47
aVI really wanted to go back to my country,
p48
aVbut at the same time I knew I could not go there,
p49
aVbecause there was no place for me.
p50
aVI had a good job.
p51
aVI was a professor at a university.
p52
aVI earned good money.
p53
aVI had a good life.
p54
aVMy family was here.
p55
aVI could live with them.
p56
aVBut I wasn't happy.
p57
aVI wanted to go back home.
p58
aVSo I went to the refugee camp.
p59
aVAnd when I went to the refugee camp in Pakistan,
p60
aVthere were 7.5 million refugees.
p61
aV7.5 million refugees.
p62
aVAbout 90 percent of them were women and children.
p63
aVMost of the men have been killed or they were in war.
p64
aVAnd you know, in the refugee camp,
p65
aVwhen I went day-to-day to do a survey,
p66
aVI found things you never could imagine.
p67
aVI saw a widow with five to eight children
p68
aVsitting there and weeping
p69
aVand not knowing what to do.
p70
aVI saw a young woman have no way to go anywhere,
p71
aVno education, no entertainment, no place to even live.
p72
aVI saw young men that had lost their father and their home,
p73
aVand they are supporting the family as a 10-to-12-year old boy \u2014
p74
aVbeing the head of the household,
p75
aVtrying to protect their sister and their mother and their children.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo it was a very devastating situation.
p78
aVMy heart was beating for my people,
p79
aVand I didn't know what to do.
p80
aVAt that moment, we talk about momentum.
p81
aVAt that moment, I felt, what can I do for these people?
p82
aVHow could I help these people?
p83
aVI am one individual. What can I do for them?
p84
aa(lp85
VBut at that moment, I knew
p86
aVthat education changed my life.
p87
aVIt transformed me. It gave me status.
p88
aVIt gave me confidence. It gave me a career.
p89
aVIt helped me to support my family,
p90
aVto bring my family to another country,
p91
aVto be safe.
p92
aVAnd I knew that at that moment
p93
aVthat what I should give to my people is education and health,
p94
aVand that's what I went after.
p95
aa(lp96
VBut do you think it was easy?
p97
aVNo, because at that time, education was banned for girls, completely.
p98
aVAnd also, by Russia invading Afghanistan,
p99
aVpeople were not trusting anyone.
p100
aVIt was very hard to come and say, "I want to do this."
p101
aVWho am I?
p102
aVSomebody who comes from the United States.
p103
aVSomebody who got educated here.
p104
aVDid they trust me? Of course not.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo I really needed to build the trust in this community.
p107
aVHow am I going to do that?
p108
aVI went and surveyed and looked and looked.
p109
aVI asked.
p110
aVFinally, I found one man.
p111
aVHe was 80 years old.
p112
aVHe was a mullah.
p113
aVI went to his tent in the camp,
p114
aVand I asked him,
p115
aV"I want to make you a teacher."
p116
aVAnd he looked at me,
p117
aVand he said, "Crazy woman,
p118
aVcrazy woman, how do you think I can be a teacher?"
p119
aVAnd I told him, "I will make you a teacher."
p120
aVFinally, he accepted my offer,
p121
aVand once I started a class in his compound,
p122
aVthe word spread all over.
p123
aVIn a matter of one year,
p124
aVwe had 25 schools set up,
p125
aV15,000 children going to school,
p126
aVand it was amazing.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Applause)
p129
aa(lp130
VThank you.
p131
aVThank you.
p132
aa(lp133
VBut of course, we're doing all our work, we were giving teacher training.
p134
aVWe were training women's rights, human rights, democracy, rule of law.
p135
aVWe were giving all kinds of training.
p136
aVAnd one day, I tell you,
p137
aVone day I was in the office in Peshawar, Pakistan.
p138
aVAll of a sudden, I saw my staff running to rooms and locking the doors
p139
aVand telling me, "Run away, hide!"
p140
aVAnd you know, as a leader, what do you do?
p141
aVYou're scared. You know it's dangerous.
p142
aVYou know your life is on the line.
p143
aVBut as a leader, you have to hold it together.
p144
aVYou have to hold it together and show strength.
p145
aVSo I said, "What's going on?"
p146
aVAnd these people were pouring into my office.
p147
aVSo I invited them to the office.
p148
aVThey came, and there were nine of them \u2014 nine Taliban.
p149
aVThey were the ugliest looking men you can ever see.
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VVery mean-looking people,
p154
aVblack clothes, black turban,
p155
aVand they pour into my office.
p156
aVAnd I invited them to have a seat and have tea.
p157
aVThey said no. They are not going to drink tea.
p158
aVAnd of course, with the tone of voice they were using,
p159
aVit was very scary,
p160
aVbut I was really shaking up.
p161
aVBut also I was strong, holding myself up.
p162
aVAnd, of course, by that time, you know how I dress \u2014
p163
aVI dress from head to toe in a black hijab.
p164
aVThe only thing you could see, my eyes.
p165
aVThey asked me, "What are you doing?
p166
aVDon't you know that school is banned for girls?
p167
aVWhat are you doing here?"
p168
aVAnd you know, I just looked at them,
p169
aVand I said, "What school? Where is the school?"
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
V(Applause)
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd they look at my face, and they said, "You are teaching girls here."
p176
aVI said, "This is a house of somebody.
p177
aVWe have some students coming,
p178
aVand they are all learning Koran, Holy Book.
p179
aVAnd you know, Koran says that if you learn the Holy Book, the woman,
p180
aVthey can be a good wife,
p181
aVand they can obey their husband."
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VAnd I tell you one thing:
p186
aVthat's the way you work with those people, and you know \u2014
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
VSo by that time, they started speaking Pashto.
p191
aVThey talked to each other,
p192
aVand they said, "Let's go, leave her alone, she's OK."
p193
aVAnd you know, this time, I offered them tea again,
p194
aVand they took a sip and they left.
p195
aVBy that time, my staff poured into my office.
p196
aVThey were scared to death.
p197
aVThey didn't know why they didn't kill me.
p198
aVThey didn't know why they didn't take me away.
p199
aVBut everybody was happy to see me.
p200
aVVery happy, and I was happy to be alive, of course.
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VOf course, I was happy to be alive.
p205
aVBut also, as we continuously gave training during the fall of the Taliban \u2014
p206
aVof course during the Taliban there is another story.
p207
aVWe went underground and we provided education for 80 schoolgirls,
p208
aV3,000 students underground, and continuously we trained.
p209
aa(lp210
VWith the fall of the Taliban, we went into the country,
p211
aVand we opened school after school.
p212
aVWe opened women's learning center.
p213
aVWe continuously opened clinics.
p214
aVWe worked with mothers and children.
p215
aVWe had reproductive health training.
p216
aVWe had all kinds of training that you can imagine.
p217
aVI was very happy. I was delighted with the outcome of my work.
p218
aVAnd one day, with four trainers and one bodyguard,
p219
aVI was going up north of Kabul,
p220
aVand all of a sudden, again,
p221
aVI was stopped in the middle of the road
p222
aVby 19 young men.
p223
aVRifles on their shoulders, they blocked the road.
p224
aVAnd I told my driver, "What's going on?"
p225
aVAnd the driver said, "I don't know."
p226
aVHe asked them. They said, "We have nothing to do with you."
p227
aVThey called my name. They said, "We want her."
p228
aVMy bodyguard got out, said, "I can answer you.
p229
aVWhat do you want?"
p230
aVThey said, "Nothing." They called my name.
p231
aVAnd by that time, the women are yelling and screaming inside the car.
p232
aVI am very shaken up, and I told myself, this is it.
p233
aVThis time, we all are going to be killed.
p234
aVThere is no doubt in my mind.
p235
aVBut still, the moment comes, and you take strength
p236
aVfrom whatever you believe and whatever you do.
p237
aVIt's in your heart.
p238
aVYou believe in your worth, and you can walk on it.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo I just hold myself on the side of the car.
p241
aVMy leg was shaking, and I got outside.
p242
aVAnd I asked them, "What can I do for you?"
p243
aVYou know what they said to me?
p244
aVThey said, "We know who you are.
p245
aVWe know where you are going.
p246
aVEvery day you go up north here and there.
p247
aVYou train women, you teach them
p248
aVand also you give them an opportunity to have a job.
p249
aVYou build their skills. How about us?"
p250
aa(lp251
V(Laughter)
p252
aa(lp253
V(Applause)
p254
aa(lp255
V"And you know, how about us?
p256
aVWhat are we going to do?"
p257
aVI looked at them, and I said, "I don't know."
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
VThey said, "It's OK.
p262
aVThe only thing we can do, what we know,
p263
aVfrom the time we're born, we just hold the gun and kill.
p264
aVThat's all we know."
p265
aVAnd you know what that means.
p266
aVIt's a trap to me, of course.
p267
aVSo I walk out of there. They said, "We'll let you go, go."
p268
aVAnd so I walked into the car, I sit in the car,
p269
aVand I told the driver, "Turn around and go back to the office."
p270
aVAt that time, we only were supporting girls.
p271
aVWe only had money for women to train them,
p272
aVto send them to school, and nothing else.
p273
aa(lp274
VBy the time I came to the office,
p275
aVof course my trainers were gone.
p276
aVThey ran away home. Nobody stayed there.
p277
aVMy bodyguard was the only one there,
p278
aVand my voice was completely gone.
p279
aVI was shaken up, and I sat on my table,
p280
aVand I said, "What am I going to do?"
p281
aVHow am I going to solve this problem?
p282
aVBecause we had training going on up north already.
p283
aVHundreds of women were there coming to get training.
p284
aa(lp285
VSo I was sitting there, all of a sudden, at this moment,
p286
aVtalking about momentum, we are,
p287
aVat that moment,
p288
aVone of my wonderful donors called me about a report.
p289
aVAnd she asked me, "Sakena?" And I answered her.
p290
aVShe said, "It's not you. What's wrong with you?"
p291
aVI said, "Nothing." I tried to cover.
p292
aVNo matter what I tried to do, she didn't believe me,
p293
aVand she asked me again.
p294
aV"OK, tell me what's going on?"
p295
aVI told her the whole story.
p296
aVAt that time, she said, "OK, you go next time, and you will help them.
p297
aVYou will help them."
p298
aVAnd when, two days later, I went the same route,
p299
aVand do you know, they were not in here,
p300
aVthey were a little back further,
p301
aVthe same young men, standing up there and holding the rifle
p302
aVand pointing to us to stop the car.
p303
aVSo we stopped the car.
p304
aVI got out. I said, "OK, let's go with me."
p305
aVAnd they said, "Yes."
p306
aVI said, "On one condition, that whatever I say, you accept it."
p307
aVAnd they said, yes, they do.
p308
aVSo I took them to the mosque,
p309
aVand to make a long story short,
p310
aVI told them I'd give them teachers.
p311
aVToday, they are the best trainers.
p312
aVThey learn English,
p313
aVthey learn how to be teachers,
p314
aVthey learn computers,
p315
aVand they are my guides.
p316
aVEvery area that is unknown to us in the mountain areas,
p317
aVthey go with me. They are ahead, and we go.
p318
aVAnd they protect us.
p319
aVAnd \u2014
p320
aa(lp321
V(Applause)
p322
aa(lp323
VThank you.
p324
aa(lp325
V(Applause)
p326
aa(lp327
VThat tells you that education transforms people.
p328
aVWhen you educate people,
p329
aVthey are going to be different,
p330
aVand today all over,
p331
aVwe need to work for gender equality.
p332
aVWe cannot only train women but forget about the men,
p333
aVbecause the men are the real people who are giving women the hardest time.
p334
aa(lp335
V(Laughter)
p336
aa(lp337
VSo we started training men because the men should know
p338
aVthe potential of women,
p339
aVknow how much these potential men has,
p340
aVand how much these women can do the same job they are doing.
p341
aVSo we are continuously giving training to men,
p342
aVand I really believe strongly.
p343
aVI live in a country that was a beautiful country.
p344
aVI just want to share this with you.
p345
aVIt was a beautiful country,
p346
aVbeautiful, peaceful country.
p347
aVWe were going everywhere.
p348
aVWomen were getting education:
p349
aVlawyer, engineer, teacher,
p350
aVand we were going from house to house.
p351
aVWe never locked our doors.
p352
aVBut you know what happened to my country.
p353
aVToday, people cannot walk out of their door without security issues.
p354
aVBut we want the same Afghanistan we had before.
p355
aVAnd I want to tell you the other side.
p356
aVToday, the women of Afghanistan are working very, very hard.
p357
aVThey are earning degrees. They are training to be lawyers.
p358
aVThey are training to be doctors, back again.
p359
aVThey are training to be teachers,
p360
aVand they are running businesses.
p361
aVSo it is so wonderful
p362
aVto see people like that reach their complete potential,
p363
aVand all of this is going to happen.
p364
aa(lp365
VI want to share this with you,
p366
aVbecause of love,
p367
aVbecause of compassion,
p368
aVand because of trust and honesty.
p369
aVIf you have these few things with you,
p370
aVyou will accomplish.
p371
aVWe have one poet, Mawl\u0101n\u0101 R\u016bm\u012b.
p372
aVHe said that by having compassion
p373
aVand having love, you can conquer the world.
p374
aVAnd I tell you, we could.
p375
aVAnd if we could do it in Afghanistan,
p376
aVI am sure 100 percent that everyone can do it in any part of the world.
p377
aa(lp378
VThank you very, very much.
p379
aa(lp380
V(Applause)
p381
aa(lp382
VThank you. Thank you.

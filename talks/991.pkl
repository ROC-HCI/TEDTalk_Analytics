VThe big residual
p5
aVis always value for money.
p6
aVAll the time we are trying to get value for money.
p7
aVWhat we don't look for
p8
aVis value for many,
p9
aVwhile we are generating value for money.
p10
aVDo we care about those four billion people
p11
aVwhose income levels are less than two dollars a day,
p12
aVthe so-called bottom of the pyramid?
p13
aVWhat are the challenges in getting value for money
p14
aVas well as value for many?
p15
aVWe have described here
p16
aVin terms of the performance
p17
aVand the price.
p18
aVIf you have money, of course, you can get the value.
p19
aVYou can get a Mercedes
p20
aVfor a very high price,
p21
aVvery high performance.
p22
aVBut if you don't have money, what happens?
p23
aVWell, you are to ride a bicycle,
p24
aVcarrying your own weight and also some other weight,
p25
aVso that you can earn the bread for the day.
p26
aVWell, poor do not remain poor;
p27
aVthey become lower-middle-class.
p28
aVAnd if they do so,
p29
aVthen, of course, the conditions improve,
p30
aVand they start riding on scooters.
p31
aVBut the challenge is, again, they don't get much value,
p32
aVbecause they can't afford anything more than the scooter.
p33
aVThe issue is, at that price,
p34
aVcan you give them some extra value?
p35
aVA super value,
p36
aVin terms of their ability to ride in a car,
p37
aVto get that dignity, to get that safety,
p38
aVlooks practically impossible, isn't it.
p39
aa(lp40
VNow, this is something
p41
aVthat we see on Indian streets
p42
aVall the time.
p43
aVBut many people see the same thing
p44
aVand think things differently,
p45
aVand one of them is here, Ratan Tata.
p46
aVThe great thing about our leaders
p47
aVis that, should they not only have passion in their belly,
p48
aVwhich practically all of them have,
p49
aVthey're also very innovative.
p50
aVAn innovator is one who does not know it cannot be done.
p51
aVThey believe that things can be done.
p52
aVBut great leaders like Ratan
p53
aVhave compassion.
p54
aVAnd what you said, Lakshmi, is absolutely true:
p55
aVit's not just Ratan Tata,
p56
aVit's the house of Tatas over time.
p57
aVLet me confirm what she said.
p58
aVYes, I went barefoot
p59
aVuntil I was 12.
p60
aVI struggled to [unclear] day
p61
aVwas a huge issue.
p62
aVAnd when I finished my SSC, the eleventh standard,
p63
aVI stood eleventh among 125,000 students.
p64
aVBut I was about to leave the school,
p65
aVbecause my poor mother couldn't afford schooling.
p66
aVAnd it was [unclear] Tata Trust, which gave me six rupees per month,
p67
aValmost a dollar per month for six years.
p68
aVThat's how I'm standing before you.
p69
aVSo that is the House of Tata.
p70
aV(Applause)
p71
aVInnovation, compassion and passion.
p72
aVThey combine all that.
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd it was that compassion which bothered them,
p75
aVbecause when he saw \u2014 in fact, he told me about eight or nine years ago
p76
aVhow he was driving his own car \u2014
p77
aVhe drives his own car by the way \u2014
p78
aVand he saw in the rain,
p79
aVa family like the one that I showed to you
p80
aVgetting drenched with an infant.
p81
aVAnd then he said, "Well, I must give them a car that they can afford,
p82
aVone lakh car, $2,000 car."
p83
aVOf course, as soon as you say something like this
p84
aVpeople say it is impossible,
p85
aVand that's what was said by Suzuki.
p86
aVHe said, oh, probably he is going to build a three-wheeler
p87
aVwith stepney.
p88
aVAnd you can see the cartoon here.
p89
aVWell they didn't build that. They built a proper car. Nano.
p90
aVAnd mind you, I'm six feet half an inch,
p91
aVRatan is taller than me,
p92
aVand we have ample space in the front
p93
aVand ample space in the back in this particular car.
p94
aVAnd incredible car.
p95
aVAnd of course, nothing succeeds like success;
p96
aVthe cynics then turned around,
p97
aVand one after the other
p98
aVthey also started saying, "Yes, we also want to make a car in the Nano Segment.
p99
aVWe'll manufacture a car in the Nano Segment."
p100
aa(lp101
VHow did this great story unfold,
p102
aVthe making of Nano?
p103
aVLet me tell you a bit about it.
p104
aVFor example, how we started:
p105
aVRatan just began with a five-engineer team,
p106
aVyoung people in their mid-twenties.
p107
aVAnd he said,
p108
aV"Well, I won't define the vehicle for you,
p109
aVbut I will define the cost for you.
p110
aVIt is one lakh, 100,000 rupees,
p111
aVand you are to make it within that."
p112
aVAnd he told them,
p113
aV"Question the unquestionable.
p114
aVStretch the envelope."
p115
aVAnd at a point in time,
p116
aVhe got so engrossed in the whole challenge,
p117
aVthat he himself became a member of the team.
p118
aVCan you believe it?
p119
aVI still am told about this story
p120
aVof that single wiper design in which he participated.
p121
aVUntil midnight, he'd be thinking.
p122
aVEarly morning he'll be coming back with sort of solutions.
p123
aVBut who was the team leader?
p124
aVThe team leader was Girish Wagh,
p125
aVa 34 year-old boy in [unclear].
p126
aVAnd the Nano team average age
p127
aVwas just 27 years.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd they did innovation in design and beyond.
p130
aVBroke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time.
p131
aVFor example, that a two-cylinder gas engine
p132
aVwas used in a car with a single balancer shaft.
p133
aVAdhesives were replacing the rivets.
p134
aVThere was a co-creation, a huge co-creation,
p135
aVwith vendors and suppliers.
p136
aVAll ideas on board were welcome.
p137
aV100 vendors were co-located adjacent to the plant,
p138
aVand innovative business models for automobile dealerships were developed.
p139
aVImagine that a fellow
p140
aVwho sells cloth, for example, will be selling Nano.
p141
aVI mean, it was incredible innovation.
p142
aVSeeking solutions for non-auto sectors.
p143
aVIt was an open innovation,
p144
aVideas from all over were welcome.
p145
aVThe mechanism of helicopters seats and windows was used, by the way,
p146
aVas well as a dashboard
p147
aVthat was inspired by two-wheelers.
p148
aVThe fuel lines and lamps
p149
aVwere as in two-wheelers.
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd the crux of the matter was, however,
p152
aVgetting more from less.
p153
aVAll the time, you have been given an envelope.
p154
aVYou can't cross that envelope,
p155
aVwhich is 100,000 rupees, 2,000 dollars.
p156
aVAnd therefore, each component
p157
aVhad to have a dual functionality.
p158
aVAnd the seat riser, for example,
p159
aVserving as a mounting for the seat
p160
aVas well as a structural part
p161
aVof the functional rigidity.
p162
aVHalf the number of parts
p163
aVare contained in Nano
p164
aVin comparison to a typical passenger car.
p165
aVThe length is smaller by eight percent by the way.
p166
aVBut the current entry-level cars
p167
aVin comparison to that is eight percent less,
p168
aVbut 21 percent more inside space.
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd what happened
p171
aVwas that \u2014 more from less \u2014
p172
aVyou can see how much more for how much less.
p173
aVWhen the Model T was launched \u2014
p174
aVand this is, by the way, all the figures
p175
aVthat are adjusted to 2007 dollar prices \u2014
p176
aVModel T was 19,700 by Ford.
p177
aVVolkswagon was 11,333.
p178
aVAnd British Motor was around 11,000.
p179
aVAnd Nano was, bang, 2,000 dollars.
p180
aVThis is why
p181
aVyou started
p182
aVactually a new paradigm shift,
p183
aVwhere the same people
p184
aVwho could not dream of sitting in a car,
p185
aVwho were carrying their entire family in a scooter,
p186
aVstarted dreaming of being in a car.
p187
aVAnd those dreams are getting fulfilled.
p188
aVThis is a photograph
p189
aVof a house and a driver and a car
p190
aVnear my own home.
p191
aVThe driver's name is Naran.
p192
aVHe has bought his own Nano.
p193
aVAnd you can see, there is a physical space
p194
aVthat has been created for him,
p195
aVparking that car, along with the owner's car,
p196
aVbut more importantly, they've created
p197
aVa space in their mind that
p198
aV"Yes, my chauffeur is going to come in his own car and park it."
p199
aVAnd that's why I call it a transformational innovation.
p200
aVIt is not just technological,
p201
aVit is social innovation that we talk about.
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd that is where, ladies and gentlemen,
p204
aVthis famous theme
p205
aVof getting more from less for more
p206
aVbecomes important.
p207
aVI remember talking about this for the first time in Australia,
p208
aVabout one and a half years ago,
p209
aVwhen their academy honored me with a fellowship.
p210
aVAnd unbelievably, in 40 years,
p211
aVI was the first Indian to be honored.
p212
aVAnd the title of my talk
p213
aVwas therefore "Indian innovation
p214
aVfrom Gandhi to Gandhian engineering."
p215
aVAnd I titled this more from less for more and more people
p216
aVas Gandhian engineering.
p217
aVAnd Gandhian engineering, in my judgment,
p218
aVis the one which is going to take the world forward,
p219
aVis going to make a difference,
p220
aVnot just for a few, but for everyone.
p221
aVLet me move from mobility in a car to individual mobility
p222
aVfor those unfortunates
p223
aVwho have lost their legs.
p224
aVHere is an American citizen and his son
p225
aVhaving an artificial foot.
p226
aVWhat is its price? 20,000 dollars.
p227
aVAnd of course, these feet are so designed
p228
aVthat they can walk only on
p229
aVsuch perfect pavement or roads.
p230
aa(lp231
VUnfortunately, that's not the case in India.
p232
aVYou can see him walk barefoot
p233
aVon an awkward land, sometimes in a marshy land,
p234
aVand so on and so forth.
p235
aVMore importantly,
p236
aVthey not only walk far to work,
p237
aVand not only do they cycle to work,
p238
aVbut they cycle for work, as you can see here.
p239
aVAnd they climb up for their work.
p240
aVYou have to design an artificial foot for such conditions.
p241
aVA challenge, of course.
p242
aVFour billion people, their incomes are less then two dollars a day.
p243
aVAnd if you talk about a 20,000-dollar shoe,
p244
aVyou're talking about 10,000 days of income.
p245
aVYou just don't have it.
p246
aVAnd therefore, you ought to look at alternatives.
p247
aa(lp248
VAnd that is how Jaipur Foot was created in India.
p249
aVIt had a revolutionary prosthetic fitment and delivery system,
p250
aVa quick molding and modular components,
p251
aVenabling custom-made, on-the-spot limb fitments.
p252
aVYou could feel it actually in an hour, by the way,
p253
aVwhereas the equivalent other feet
p254
aVtook something like a day, as so on.
p255
aVOuter socket made by using heated high-density polyethylene pipes,
p256
aVrather than using heated sheets.
p257
aVAnd unique high-ankle design and human-like looks,
p258
aV[unclear] and functions.
p259
aVAnd I like to show how it looks
p260
aVand how it works.
p261
aV(Music)
p262
aVSee, he jumps. You can see what stress it must have.
p263
aa(lp264
V(Text: ... any person with a below the knee limb could do this.
p265
aV... above the limb, yes, it would be difficult ...
p266
aV"Did it hurt?"
p267
aV"No ... not at all."
p268
aV... he can run a kilometer in four minutes and 30 seconds ...)
p269
aa(lp270
VOne kilometer in four minutes and 30 seconds.
p271
aV(Applause)
p272
aVSo that's what it is all about.
p273
aVAnd therefore Time took notice
p274
aVof this 28-dollar foot, basically.
p275
aV(Applause)
p276
aVAn incredible story.
p277
aa(lp278
VLet's move on to something else.
p279
aVI've been talking about getting more from less for more.
p280
aVLet's move to health.
p281
aVWe've talked about mobility and the rest of it, let's talk about health.
p282
aVWhat's happening in the area of health?
p283
aVYou know, you have new diseases that require new drugs.
p284
aVAnd if you look at the drug development 10 years ago and now,
p285
aVwhat has happened?
p286
aV10 years ago, it used to cost about a quarter billion.
p287
aVToday it costs 1.5 billion dollars.
p288
aVTime taken for moving a molecule to marketplace,
p289
aVafter all the human and animal testing,
p290
aVwas 10 years, now it is 15 years.
p291
aVAre you getting more drugs because you are spending more time and more money?
p292
aVNo, I'm sorry.
p293
aVWe used to have 40, now they have come down to 30.
p294
aVSo actually we are getting less from more
p295
aVfor less and less people.
p296
aVWhy less and less people? Because it is so expensive,
p297
aVso very few will be able to basically afford that.
p298
aa(lp299
VLet us just take an example.
p300
aVPsoriasis is very dreadful
p301
aVdisease of the skin.
p302
aVThe cost of treatment, 20,000 dollars.
p303
aV1,000-dollar antibody injections under the skin, by the way,
p304
aVand 20 of them.
p305
aVTime for development \u2014 it took around 10 years
p306
aVand 700 million dollars.
p307
aVLet's start in the spirit
p308
aVof more from less and more for more
p309
aVand start putting some targets.
p310
aVFor example, we don't want 20,000 dollars; we don't have it.
p311
aVCan we do it [for] 100 dollars?
p312
aVTime for development, not 10 years.
p313
aVWe are in a hurry. Five years.
p314
aVCost of development \u2014 300 million dollars.
p315
aVSorry. I can't spend more than 10 million dollars.
p316
aVLooks absolutely audacious.
p317
aVLooks absolutely ridiculous.
p318
aa(lp319
VYou know something? This has been achieved in India.
p320
aVThese targets have been achieved in India.
p321
aVAnd how they have been achieved ...
p322
aVSir Francis Bacon once said,
p323
aV"When you wish to achieve results
p324
aVthat have not been achieved before,
p325
aVit is an unwise fancy to think
p326
aVthat they can be achieved by using methods
p327
aVthat have been used before."
p328
aVAnd therefore, the standard process,
p329
aVwhere you develop a molecule, put it into mice, into men,
p330
aVare not yielding those results \u2014
p331
aVthe billions of dollars that have been spent.
p332
aVThe Indian cleverness
p333
aVwas using its traditional knowledge,
p334
aVhowever, scientifically validating it
p335
aVand making that journey from men to mice to men,
p336
aVnot molecule to mice to men, you know.
p337
aVAnd that is how this difference has come.
p338
aVAnd you can see this blending
p339
aVof traditional medicine, modern medicine, modern science.
p340
aVI launched a big program
p341
aV[unclear] CSIR about nine years ago.
p342
aVHe is giving us not just for Psoriasis,
p343
aVfor cancer and a whole range of things, changing the whole paradigm.
p344
aVAnd you can see this Indian Psoriasis breakthrough
p345
aVobtained by this reverse form of [unclear]
p346
aVby doing things differently.
p347
aVYou can see before treatment and after treatment.
p348
aVThis is really getting more from less for more and more people,
p349
aVbecause these are all affordable treatments now.
p350
aa(lp351
VLet me just remind you
p352
aVof what Mahatma Gandhi had said.
p353
aVHe had said, "Earth provides enough
p354
aVto satisfy every man's need, but not every man's greed."
p355
aVSo the message he was giving us
p356
aVwas you must get more from less and less and less
p357
aVso that you can share it for more and more people,
p358
aVnot only the current generation,
p359
aVbut the future generations.
p360
aVAnd he also said, "I would prize every invention of science
p361
aVmade for the benefit for all."
p362
aVSo he was giving you the message that you must have it for more and more people,
p363
aVnot just a few people.
p364
aVAnd therefore, ladies and gentlemen,
p365
aVthis is the theme, getting more
p366
aVfrom less for more.
p367
aVAnd mind you,
p368
aVit is not getting just a little more for just a little less.
p369
aVIt's not about low cost.
p370
aVIt's about ultra-low cost.
p371
aVYou cannot say it's a mere treatment 10,000 dollars,
p372
aVbut because you are poor I'll give it for 9,000.
p373
aVSorry, it doesn't work. You have to give it for 100 dollars, 200 dollars.
p374
aVIs it possible? It has been made possible, by the way,
p375
aVfor certain other different reasons.
p376
aVSo you are not talking about low cost, you are talking about ultra-low cost.
p377
aVYou are not talking about affordability,
p378
aVyou are talking about extreme affordability.
p379
aVBecause of the four billion people whose income is under two dollars a day.
p380
aVYou're not talking exclusive innovation.
p381
aVYou're talking about inclusive innovation.
p382
aVAnd therefore, you're not talking about incremental innovation,
p383
aVyou're talking about disruptive innovation.
p384
aVThe ideas have to be such
p385
aVthat you think in completely different terms.
p386
aVAnd I would also add,
p387
aVit is not only getting more from less for more
p388
aVby more and more people, the whole world working for it.
p389
aa(lp390
VI was very touched when I saw a breakthrough the other day.
p391
aVYou know, incubators for infants, for example.
p392
aVThey're not available in Africa.
p393
aVThey're not available in Indian villages.
p394
aVAnd infants die.
p395
aVAnd incubator costs 2,000 dollars.
p396
aVAnd there's a 25-dollar incubator
p397
aVgiving that performance that had been created.
p398
aVAnd by whom?
p399
aVBy young students from Standford University
p400
aVon an extreme affordability project that they had, basically.
p401
aVTheir heart is in the right place, like Ratan Tata.
p402
aVIt's not just innovation, compassion and passion \u2014
p403
aVcompassion in the heart and passion in the belly.
p404
aVThat's the new world that we want to create.
p405
aVAnd that is why the message is that of Gandhian engineering.
p406
aa(lp407
VLadies and gentlemen, I'd like to end before time.
p408
aVI was also afraid of those 18 minutes.
p409
aVI've still one and a half to go.
p410
aVThe message, the final message, is this:
p411
aVIndia gave a great gift to the world.
p412
aVWhat was that?
p413
aV[In the] 20th century, we gave Gandhi to the world.
p414
aVThe 21st century gift,
p415
aVwhich is very, very important for the whole world,
p416
aVwhether it is global economic meltdown,
p417
aVwhether it is climate change \u2014
p418
aVany problem that you talk about
p419
aVis gaining more from less for more and more \u2014
p420
aVnot only the current generations,
p421
aVfor the future generations.
p422
aVAnd that can come only from Gandhian engineering.
p423
aVSo ladies and gentlemen, I'm very happy to announce,
p424
aVthis gift of the 21st century
p425
aVto the world from India,
p426
aVGandhian engineering.
p427
aa(lp428
V(Applause)
p429
aa(lp430
VLakshmi Pratury: Thank you, Dr. Mashelkar. (R.A. Mashelkar: Thank you very much.)
p431
aa(lp432
VLP: A quick question for you.
p433
aVNow, when you were a young boy in this school,
p434
aVwhat were your thoughts, like what did you think you could become?
p435
aVWhat do you think that drove you?
p436
aVWas there a vision you had? What is it that drove you?
p437
aa(lp438
VRAM: I'll tell you a story that drove me, that transformed my life.
p439
aVI remember, I went to a poor school,
p440
aVbecause my mother could not gather the 21 rupees,
p441
aVthat half a dollar that was required
p442
aVwithin the stipulated time.
p443
aVIt was [unclear] high school.
p444
aVBut it was a poor school with rich teachers, honestly.
p445
aVAnd one of them was [unclear] who taught us physics.
p446
aVOne day he took us out into the sun
p447
aVand tried to show us how to find
p448
aVthe focal length of a convex lens.
p449
aVThe lens was here. The piece of paper was there. He moved it up and down.

aVAnd there was a bright spot up there.
p451
aVAnd then he said, "This is the focal length."
p452
aVBut then he held it for a little while, Lakshmi.
p453
aVAnd then the paper burned.
p454
aVWhen the paper burned, for some reason he turned to me,
p455
aVand he said, "Mashelkar, like this,
p456
aVif you do not diffuse your energies,
p457
aVif you focus your energies,
p458
aVyou can achieve anything in the world."
p459
aVThat gave me a great message: focus and you can achieve.
p460
aVI said, "Whoa, science is so wonderful,
p461
aVI have to become a scientist."
p462
aVBut more importantly, focus and you can achieve.
p463
aVAnd that message, very frankly,
p464
aVis valuable for society today.
p465
aa(lp466
VWhat does that focal length do?
p467
aVIt has parallel lines, which are sun rays.
p468
aVAnd the property of parallel lines
p469
aVis that they never meet.
p470
aVWhat does that convex lens do?
p471
aVIt makes them meet.
p472
aVThis is convex lens leadership.
p473
aVYou know what today's leadership is doing? Concave length.
p474
aVThey divide them farther.
p475
aVSo I learned the lesson
p476
aVof convex lens leadership from that.
p477
aVAnd when I was at National Chemical Laboratory [unclear].
p478
aVWhen I was at Council of Scientific Industry Research \u2014
p479
aV40 laboratories \u2014 when two laboratories were not talking to each other,
p480
aVI would [unclear].
p481
aVAnd currently I'm president of Global Research Alliance,
p482
aV60,000 scientists in nine counties, right from India to the U.S.
p483
aVI'm trying to build a global team,
p484
aVwhich will look at the global grand challenges that the world is facing.
p485
aVThat was the lesson. That was the inspirational moment.

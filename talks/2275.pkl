VAbout 10 years ago, I went through a little bit of a hard time.
p5
aVSo I decided to go see a therapist.
p6
aVI had been seeing her for a few months, when she looked at me one day and said,
p7
aV"Who actually raised you until you were three?"
p8
aVSeemed like a weird question. I said, "My parents."
p9
aVAnd she said, "I don't think that's actually the case;
p10
aVbecause if it were,
p11
aVwe'd be dealing with things that are far more complicated than just this."
p12
aa(lp13
VIt sounded like the setup to a joke, but I knew she was serious.
p14
aVBecause when I first started seeing her,
p15
aVI was trying to be the funniest person in the room.
p16
aVAnd I would try and crack these jokes, but she caught on to me really quickly,
p17
aVand whenever I tried to make a joke, she would look at me and say,
p18
aV"That is actually really sad."
p19
aV(Laughter)
p20
aVIt's terrible.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo I knew I had to be serious, and I asked my parents
p23
aVwho had actually raised me until I was three?
p24
aVAnd to my surprise, they said
p25
aVmy primary caregiver had been a distant relative of the family.
p26
aVI had called her my auntie.
p27
aa(lp28
VI remember my auntie so clearly,
p29
aVit felt like she had been part of my life when I was much older.
p30
aVI remember the thick, straight hair,
p31
aVand how it would come around me like a curtain
p32
aVwhen she bent to pick me up;
p33
aVher soft, southern Thai accent;
p34
aVthe way I would cling to her,
p35
aVeven if she just wanted to go to the bathroom
p36
aVor get something to eat.
p37
aVI loved her, but [with] the ferocity that a child has sometimes
p38
aVbefore she understands that love also requires letting go.
p39
aa(lp40
VBut my clearest and sharpest memory of my auntie,
p41
aVis also one of my first memories of life at all.
p42
aVI remember her being beaten and slapped by another member of my family.
p43
aVI remember screaming hysterically and wanting it to stop,
p44
aVas I did every single time it happened,
p45
aVfor things as minor as wanting to go out with her friends,
p46
aVor being a little late.
p47
aVI became so hysterical over her treatment,
p48
aVthat eventually, she was just beaten behind closed doors.
p49
aa(lp50
VThings got so bad for her that eventually she ran away.
p51
aVAs an adult, I learned later
p52
aVthat she had been just 19 when she was brought over from Thailand
p53
aVto the States to care for me, on a tourist visa.
p54
aVShe wound up working in Illinois for a time,
p55
aVbefore eventually returning to Thailand,
p56
aVwhich is where I ran into her again, at a political rally in Bangkok.
p57
aVI clung to her again, as I had when I was a child,
p58
aVand I let go, and then I promised that I would call.
p59
aVI never did, though.
p60
aVBecause I was afraid if I said everything that she meant to me \u2014
p61
aVthat I owed perhaps the best parts of who I became to her care,
p62
aVand that the words "I'm sorry" were like a thimble
p63
aVto bail out all the guilt and shame and rage I felt
p64
aVover everything she had endured to care for me for as long as she had \u2014
p65
aVI thought if I said those words to her, I would never stop crying again.
p66
aVBecause she had saved me.
p67
aVAnd I had not saved her.
p68
aa(lp69
VI'm a journalist, and I've been writing and researching human trafficking
p70
aVfor the past eight years or so,
p71
aVand even so, I never put together this personal story
p72
aVwith my professional life until pretty recently.
p73
aVI think this profound disconnect actually symbolizes
p74
aVmost of our understanding about human trafficking.
p75
aVBecause human trafficking is far more prevalent, complex and close to home
p76
aVthan most of us realize.
p77
aa(lp78
VI spent time in jails and brothels,
p79
aVinterviewed hundreds of survivors and law enforcement, NGO workers.
p80
aVAnd when I think about what we've done about human trafficking,
p81
aVI am hugely disappointed.
p82
aVPartly because we don't even talk about the problem right at all.
p83
aVWhen I say "human trafficking,"
p84
aVmost of you probably don't think about someone like my auntie.
p85
aVYou probably think about a young girl or woman,
p86
aVwho's been brutally forced into prostitution by a violent pimp.
p87
aVThat is real suffering, and that is a real story.
p88
aVThat story makes me angry
p89
aVfor far more than just the reality of that situation, though.
p90
aa(lp91
VAs a journalist, I really care about how we relate to each other through language,
p92
aVand the way we tell that story, with all the gory, violent detail,
p93
aVthe salacious aspects \u2014 I call that "look at her scars" journalism.
p94
aVWe use that story to convince ourselves
p95
aVthat human trafficking is a bad man doing a bad thing to an innocent girl.
p96
aVThat story lets us off the hook.
p97
aVIt takes away all the societal context that we might be indicted for,
p98
aVfor the structural inequality, or the poverty,
p99
aVor the barriers to migration.
p100
aVWe let ourselves think
p101
aVthat human trafficking is only about forced prostitution,
p102
aVwhen in reality,
p103
aVhuman trafficking is embedded in our everyday lives.
p104
aa(lp105
VLet me show you what I mean.
p106
aVForced prostitution accounts for 22 percent of human trafficking.
p107
aVTen percent is in state- imposed forced labor.
p108
aVbut a whopping 68 percent is for the purpose of creating the goods
p109
aVand delivering the services that most of us rely on every day,
p110
aVin sectors like agricultural work, domestic work and construction.
p111
aVThat is food and care and shelter.
p112
aVAnd somehow, these most essential workers
p113
aVare also among the world's most underpaid and exploited today.
p114
aVHuman trafficking is the use of force, fraud or coercion
p115
aVto compel another person's labor.
p116
aVAnd it's found in cotton fields, and coltan mines,
p117
aVand even car washes in Norway and England.
p118
aVIt's found in U.S. military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan.
p119
aa(lp120
VIt's found in Thailand's fishing industry.
p121
aVThat country has become the largest exporter of shrimp in the world.
p122
aVBut what are the circumstances
p123
aVbehind all that cheap and plentiful shrimp?
p124
aVThai military were caught selling Burmese and Cambodian migrants
p125
aVonto fishing boats.
p126
aVThose fishing boats were taken out, the men put to work,
p127
aVand they were thrown overboard if they made the mistake of falling sick,
p128
aVor trying to resist their treatment.
p129
aVThose fish were then used to feed shrimp,
p130
aVThe shrimp were then sold to four major global retailers:
p131
aVCostco, Tesco, Walmart and Carrefour.
p132
aa(lp133
VHuman trafficking is found on a smaller scale than just that,
p134
aVand in places you would never even imagine.
p135
aVTraffickers have forced young people to drive ice cream trucks,
p136
aVor to sing in touring boys' choirs.
p137
aVTrafficking has even been found in a hair braiding salon in New Jersey.
p138
aa(lp139
VThe scheme in that case was incredible.
p140
aVThe traffickers found young families who were from Ghana and Togo,
p141
aVand they told these families that "your daughters are going to get
p142
aVa fine education in the United States."
p143
aVThey then located winners of the green card lottery,
p144
aVand they told them, "We'll help you out.
p145
aVWe'll get you a plane ticket. We'll pay your fees.
p146
aVAll you have to do is take this young girl with you,
p147
aVsay that she's your sister or your spouse.
p148
aVOnce everyone arrived in New Jersey, the young girls were taken away,
p149
aVand put to work for 14-hour days,
p150
aVseven days a week, for five years.
p151
aVThey made their traffickers nearly four million dollars.
p152
aa(lp153
VThis is a huge problem.
p154
aVSo what have we done about it?
p155
aVWe've mostly turned to the criminal justice system.
p156
aVBut keep in mind, most victims of human trafficking are poor and marginalized.
p157
aVThey're migrants, people of color.
p158
aVSometimes they're in the sex trade.
p159
aVAnd for populations like these,
p160
aVthe criminal justice system is too often part of the problem,
p161
aVrather than the solution.
p162
aVIn study after study, in countries ranging from Bangladesh to the United States,
p163
aVbetween 20 and 60 percent of the people in the sex trade who were surveyed
p164
aVsaid that they had been raped or assaulted by the police in the past year alone.
p165
aVPeople in prostitution, including people who have been trafficked into it,
p166
aVregularly receive multiple convictions for prostitution.
p167
aVHaving that criminal record makes it so much more difficult
p168
aVto leave poverty, leave abuse, or leave prostitution,
p169
aVif that person so desires.
p170
aVWorkers outside of the sex sector \u2014
p171
aVif they try and resist their treatment, they risk deportation.
p172
aVIn case after case I've studied, employers have no problem
p173
aVcalling on law enforcement to try and threaten or deport
p174
aVtheir striking trafficked workers.
p175
aVIf those workers run away,
p176
aVthey risk becoming part of the great mass of undocumented workers
p177
aVwho are also subject to the whims of law enforcement if they're caught.
p178
aa(lp179
VLaw enforcement is supposed to identify victims and prosecute traffickers.
p180
aVBut out of an estimated 21 million victims of human trafficking in the world,
p181
aVthey have helped and identified fewer than 50,000 people.
p182
aVThat's like comparing
p183
aVthe population of the world to the population of Los Angeles,
p184
aVproportionally speaking.
p185
aVAs for convictions, out of an estimated 5,700 convictions in 2013,
p186
aVfewer than 500 were for labor trafficking.
p187
aVKeep in mind that labor trafficking
p188
aVaccounts for 68 percent of all trafficking,
p189
aVbut fewer than 10 percent of the convictions.
p190
aa(lp191
VI've heard one expert say that trafficking happens where need meets greed.
p192
aVI'd like to add one more element to that.
p193
aVTrafficking happens in sectors where workers are excluded from protections,
p194
aVand denied the right to organize.
p195
aVTrafficking doesn't happen in a vacuum.
p196
aVIt happens in systematically degraded work environments.
p197
aVYou might be thinking,
p198
aVoh, she's talking about failed states, or war-torn states, or \u2014
p199
aVI'm actually talking about the United States.
p200
aVLet me tell you what that looks like.
p201
aa(lp202
VI spent many months researching a trafficking case called Global Horizons,
p203
aVinvolving hundreds of Thai farm workers.
p204
aVThey were sent all over the States, to work in Hawaii pineapple plantations,
p205
aVand Washington apple orchards, and anywhere the work was needed.
p206
aVThey were promised three years of solid agricultural work.
p207
aVSo they made a calculated risk.
p208
aVThey sold their land, they sold their wives' jewelry,
p209
aVto make thousands in recruitment fees for this company, Global Horizons.
p210
aVBut once they were brought over,
p211
aVtheir passports were confiscated.
p212
aVSome of the men were beaten and held at gunpoint.
p213
aVThey worked so hard they fainted in the fields.
p214
aVThis case hit me so hard.
p215
aa(lp216
VAfter I came back home,
p217
aVI was wandering through the grocery store, and I froze in the produce department.
p218
aVI was remembering the over-the-top meals the Global Horizons survivors
p219
aVwould make for me every time I showed up to interview them.
p220
aVThey finished one meal with this plate of perfect, long-stemmed strawberries,
p221
aVand as they handed them to me, they said,
p222
aV"Aren't these the kind of strawberries you eat with somebody special
p223
aVin the States?
p224
aVAnd don't they taste so much better
p225
aVwhen you know the people whose hands picked them for you?"
p226
aa(lp227
VAs I stood in that grocery store weeks later, I realized I had no idea
p228
aVof who to thank for this plenty,
p229
aVand no idea of how they were being treated.
p230
aVSo, like the journalist I am, I started digging into the agricultural sector.
p231
aVAnd I found there are too many fields, and too few labor inspectors.
p232
aVI found multiple layers of plausible deniability
p233
aVbetween grower and distributor and processor, and God knows who else.
p234
aVThe Global Horizons survivors had been brought to the States
p235
aVon a temporary guest worker program.
p236
aVThat guest worker program ties a person's legal status
p237
aVto his or her employer,
p238
aVand denies that worker the right to organize.
p239
aVMind you, none of what I am describing about this agricultural sector
p240
aVor the guest worker program is actually human trafficking.
p241
aVIt is merely what we find legally tolerable.
p242
aVAnd I would argue this is fertile ground for exploitation.
p243
aVAnd all of this had been hidden to me, before I had tried to understand it.
p244
aa(lp245
VI wasn't the only person grappling with these issues.
p246
aVPierre Omidyar, founder of eBay,
p247
aVis one of the biggest anti-trafficking philanthropists in the world.
p248
aVAnd even he wound up accidentally investing nearly 10 million dollars
p249
aVin the pineapple plantation cited as having the worst working conditions
p250
aVin that Global Horizons case.
p251
aVWhen he found out, he and his wife were shocked and horrified,
p252
aVand they wound up writing an op-ed for a newspaper,
p253
aVsaying that it was up to all of us to learn everything we can
p254
aVabout the labor and supply chains of the products that we support.
p255
aVI totally agree.
p256
aa(lp257
VWhat would happen if each one of us decided
p258
aVthat we are no longer going to support companies
p259
aVif they don't eliminate exploitation from their labor and supply chains?
p260
aVIf we demanded laws calling for the same?
p261
aVIf all the CEOs out there decided
p262
aVthat they were going to go through their businesses and say, "no more"?
p263
aVIf we ended recruitment fees for migrant workers?
p264
aVIf we decided that guest workers should have the right to organize
p265
aVwithout fear of retaliation?
p266
aVThese would be decisions heard around the world.
p267
aVThis isn't a matter of buying a fair-trade peach
p268
aVand calling it a day, buying a guilt-free zone with your money.
p269
aVThat's not how it works.
p270
aVThis is the decision to change a system that is broken,
p271
aVand that we have unwittingly but willingly
p272
aVallowed ourselves to profit from and benefit from for too long.
p273
aa(lp274
VWe often dwell on human trafficking survivors' victimization.
p275
aVBut that is not my experience of them.
p276
aVOver all the years that I've been talking to them,
p277
aVthey have taught me that we are more than our worst days.
p278
aVEach one of us is more than what we have lived through.
p279
aVEspecially trafficking survivors.
p280
aVThese people were the most resourceful and resilient and responsible
p281
aVin their communities.
p282
aVThey were the people that you would take a gamble on.
p283
aVYou'd say, I'm gong to sell my rings, because I have the chance
p284
aVto send you off to a better future.
p285
aVThey were the emissaries of hope.
p286
aa(lp287
VThese survivors don't need saving.
p288
aVThey need solidarity, because they're behind
p289
aVsome of the most exciting social justice movements out there today.
p290
aVThe nannies and housekeepers who marched with their families
p291
aVand their employers' families \u2014
p292
aVtheir activism got us an international treaty
p293
aVon domestic workers' rights.
p294
aVThe Nepali women who were trafficked into the sex trade \u2014
p295
aVthey came together, and they decided
p296
aVthat they were going to make the world's first anti-trafficking organization
p297
aVactually headed and run by trafficking survivors themselves.
p298
aVThese Indian shipyard workers were trafficked
p299
aVto do post-Hurricane Katrina reconstruction.
p300
aVThey were threatened with deportation, but they broke out of their work compound
p301
aVand they marched from New Orleans to Washington, D.C.,
p302
aVto protest labor exploitation.
p303
aVThey cofounded an organization called the National Guest Worker Alliance,
p304
aVand through this organization, they have wound up helping other workers
p305
aVbring to light exploitation and abuses in supply chains
p306
aVin Walmart and Hershey's factories.
p307
aVAnd although the Department of Justice declined to take their case,
p308
aVa team of civil rights lawyers won the first of a dozen civil suits
p309
aVthis February, and got their clients 14 million dollars.
p310
aa(lp311
VThese survivors are fighting for people they don't even know yet,
p312
aVother workers, and for the possibility of a just world for all of us.
p313
aVThis is our chance to do the same.
p314
aVThis is our chance to make the decision
p315
aVthat tells us who we are, as a people and as a society;
p316
aVthat our prosperity is no longer prosperity,
p317
aVas long as it is pinned to other people's pain;
p318
aVthat our lives are inextricably woven together;
p319
aVand that we have the power to make a different choice.
p320
aa(lp321
VI was so reluctant to share my story of my auntie with you.
p322
aVBefore I started this TED process and climbed up on this stage,
p323
aVI had told literally a handful of people about it,
p324
aVbecause, like many a journalist,
p325
aVI am far more interested in learning about your stories
p326
aVthan sharing much, if anything, about my own.
p327
aVI also haven't done my journalistic due diligence on this.
p328
aVI haven't issued my mountains of document requests,
p329
aVand interviewed everyone and their mother,
p330
aVand I haven't found my auntie yet.
p331
aVI don't know her story of what happened, and of her life now.
p332
aVThe story as I've told it to you is messy and unfinished.
p333
aVBut I think it mirrors the messy and unfinished situation we're all in,
p334
aVwhen it comes to human trafficking.
p335
aVWe are all implicated in this problem.
p336
aVBut that means we are all also part of its solution.
p337
aVFiguring out how to build a more just world is our work to do,
p338
aVand our story to tell.
p339
aVSo let us tell it the way we should have done,
p340
aVfrom the very beginning.
p341
aVLet us tell this story together.
p342
aa(lp343
VThank you so much.

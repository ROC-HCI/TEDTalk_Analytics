VSo, I've known a lot of fish in my life.
p5
aVI've loved only two.
p6
aVThat first one,
p7
aVit was more like a passionate affair.
p8
aVIt was a beautiful fish:
p9
aVflavorful, textured, meaty,
p10
aVa bestseller on the menu.
p11
aVWhat a fish.
p12
aV(Laughter)
p13
aVEven better,
p14
aVit was farm-raised to the supposed highest standards
p15
aVof sustainability.
p16
aVSo you could feel good about selling it.
p17
aa(lp18
VI was in a relationship with this beauty
p19
aVfor several months.
p20
aVOne day, the head of the company called
p21
aVand asked if I'd speak at an event
p22
aVabout the farm's sustainability.
p23
aV"Absolutely," I said.
p24
aVHere was a company trying to solve
p25
aVwhat's become this unimaginable problem for us chefs:
p26
aVHow do we keep fish on our menus?
p27
aa(lp28
VFor the past 50 years,
p29
aVwe've been fishing the seas
p30
aVlike we clear-cut forests.
p31
aVIt's hard to overstate the destruction.
p32
aVNinety percent of large fish, the ones we love \u2014
p33
aVthe tunas, the halibuts, the salmons, swordfish \u2014
p34
aVthey've collapsed.
p35
aVThere's almost nothing left.
p36
aVSo, for better or for worse,
p37
aVaquaculture, fish farming, is going to be a part of our future.
p38
aVA lot of arguments against it:
p39
aVFish farms pollute \u2014 most of them do anyway \u2014
p40
aVand they're inefficient. Take tuna,
p41
aVa major drawback.
p42
aVIt's got a feed conversion ratio
p43
aVof 15 to one.
p44
aVThat means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish
p45
aVto get you one pound of farm tuna.
p46
aVNot very sustainable.
p47
aVIt doesn't taste very good either.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo here, finally,
p50
aVwas a company trying to do it right.
p51
aVI wanted to support them.
p52
aVThe day before the event,
p53
aVI called the head of P.R. for the company.
p54
aVLet's call him Don.
p55
aa(lp56
V"Don," I said, "just to get the facts straight, you guys are famous
p57
aVfor farming so far out to sea, you don't pollute."
p58
aa(lp59
V"That's right," he said. "We're so far out,
p60
aVthe waste from our fish gets distributed,
p61
aVnot concentrated."
p62
aVAnd then he added,
p63
aV"We're basically a world unto ourselves.
p64
aVThat feed conversion ratio? 2.5 to one," he said.
p65
aV"Best in the business."
p66
aa(lp67
V2.5 to one, great.
p68
aV"2.5 what? What are you feeding?"
p69
aa(lp70
V"Sustainable proteins," he said.
p71
aa(lp72
V"Great," I said. Got off the phone.
p73
aVAnd that night, I was lying in bed, and I thought:
p74
aVWhat the hell is a sustainable protein?
p75
aV(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VSo the next day, just before the event, I called Don.
p78
aVI said, "Don, what are some examples of sustainable proteins?"
p79
aa(lp80
VHe said he didn't know. He would ask around.
p81
aVWell, I got on the phone with a few people in the company;
p82
aVno one could give me a straight answer
p83
aVuntil finally, I got on the phone
p84
aVwith the head biologist.
p85
aVLet's call him Don too.
p86
aV(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
V"Don," I said,
p89
aV"what are some examples of sustainable proteins?"
p90
aa(lp91
VWell, he mentioned some algaes
p92
aVand some fish meals,
p93
aVand then he said chicken pellets.
p94
aVI said, "Chicken pellets?"
p95
aa(lp96
VHe said, "Yeah, feathers, skin,
p97
aVbone meal, scraps,
p98
aVdried and processed into feed."
p99
aa(lp100
VI said, "What percentage
p101
aVof your feed is chicken?"
p102
aVThinking, you know, two percent.
p103
aa(lp104
V"Well, it's about 30 percent," he said.
p105
aa(lp106
VI said, "Don, what's sustainable
p107
aVabout feeding chicken to fish?"
p108
aV(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VThere was a long pause on the line,
p111
aVand he said, "There's just too much chicken in the world."
p112
aV(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VI fell out of love with this fish.
p115
aV(Laughter)
p116
aVNo, not because I'm some self-righteous,
p117
aVgoody-two shoes foodie.
p118
aVI actually am.
p119
aV(Laughter)
p120
aVNo, I actually fell out of love with this fish because, I swear to God,
p121
aVafter that conversation, the fish tasted like chicken.
p122
aV(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VThis second fish,
p125
aVit's a different kind of love story.
p126
aVIt's the romantic kind,
p127
aVthe kind where the more you get to know your fish,
p128
aVyou love the fish.
p129
aVI first ate it at a restaurant
p130
aVin southern Spain.
p131
aVA journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time.
p132
aVShe kind of set us up.
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVIt came to the table
p135
aVa bright, almost shimmering, white color.
p136
aVThe chef had overcooked it.
p137
aVLike twice over.
p138
aVAmazingly, it was still delicious.
p139
aa(lp140
VWho can make a fish taste good
p141
aVafter it's been overcooked?
p142
aVI can't,
p143
aVbut this guy can.
p144
aVLet's call him Miguel \u2014
p145
aVactually his name is Miguel.
p146
aV(Laughter)
p147
aVAnd no, he didn't cook the fish, and he's not a chef,
p148
aVat least in the way that you and I understand it.
p149
aVHe's a biologist
p150
aVat Veta La Palma.
p151
aVIt's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain.
p152
aVIt's at the tip of the Guadalquivir river.
p153
aa(lp154
VUntil the 1980s,
p155
aVthe farm was in the hands of the Argentinians.
p156
aVThey raised beef cattle
p157
aVon what was essentially wetlands.
p158
aVThey did it by draining the land.
p159
aVThey built this intricate series of canals,
p160
aVand they pushed water off the land and out into the river.
p161
aVWell, they couldn't make it work,
p162
aVnot economically.
p163
aVAnd ecologically, it was a disaster.
p164
aVIt killed like 90 percent of the birds,
p165
aVwhich, for this place, is a lot of birds.
p166
aVAnd so in 1982,
p167
aVa Spanish company with an environmental conscience
p168
aVpurchased the land.
p169
aa(lp170
VWhat did they do?
p171
aVThey reversed the flow of water.
p172
aVThey literally flipped the switch.
p173
aVInstead of pushing water out,
p174
aVthey used the channels to pull water back in.
p175
aVThey flooded the canals.
p176
aVThey created a 27,000-acre fish farm \u2014
p177
aVbass, mullet,
p178
aVshrimp, eel \u2014
p179
aVand in the process, Miguel and this company
p180
aVcompletely reversed the ecological destruction.
p181
aVThe farm's incredible.
p182
aVI mean, you've never seen anything like this.
p183
aVYou stare out at a horizon
p184
aVthat is a million miles away,
p185
aVand all you see are flooded canals
p186
aVand this thick, rich marshland.
p187
aa(lp188
VI was there not long ago with Miguel.
p189
aVHe's an amazing guy,
p190
aVlike three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee.
p191
aV(Laughter)
p192
aVOkay? There we are slogging through the wetlands,
p193
aVand I'm panting and sweating, got mud up to my knees,
p194
aVand Miguel's calmly conducting a biology lecture.
p195
aVHere, he's pointing out a rare Black-shouldered Kite.
p196
aVNow, he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton.
p197
aVAnd here, here he sees a grouping pattern
p198
aVthat reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe.
p199
aa(lp200
VIt turns out, Miguel spent the better part of his career
p201
aVin the Mikumi National Park in Africa.
p202
aVI asked him how he became
p203
aVsuch an expert on fish.
p204
aa(lp205
VHe said, "Fish? I didn't know anything about fish.
p206
aVI'm an expert in relationships."
p207
aVAnd then he's off, launching into more talk
p208
aVabout rare birds and algaes
p209
aVand strange aquatic plants.
p210
aa(lp211
VAnd don't get me wrong, that was really fascinating, you know,
p212
aVthe biotic community unplugged, kind of thing.
p213
aVIt's great, but I was in love.
p214
aVAnd my head was swooning over that
p215
aVovercooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before.
p216
aVSo I interrupted him. I said,
p217
aV"Miguel, what makes your fish taste so good?"
p218
aa(lp219
VHe pointed at the algae.
p220
aa(lp221
V"I know, dude, the algae, the phytoplankton,
p222
aVthe relationships: It's amazing.
p223
aVBut what are your fish eating?
p224
aVWhat's the feed conversion ratio?"
p225
aa(lp226
VWell, he goes on to tell me
p227
aVit's such a rich system
p228
aVthat the fish are eating what they'd be eating in the wild.
p229
aVThe plant biomass, the phytoplankton,
p230
aVthe zooplankton, it's what feeds the fish.
p231
aVThe system is so healthy,
p232
aVit's totally self-renewing.
p233
aVThere is no feed.
p234
aVEver heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals?
p235
aa(lp236
VLater that day, I was driving around this property with Miguel,
p237
aVand I asked him, I said, "For a place that seems so natural,
p238
aVunlike like any farm I'd ever been at,
p239
aVhow do you measure success?"
p240
aa(lp241
VAt that moment, it was as if
p242
aVa film director called for a set change.
p243
aVAnd we rounded the corner
p244
aVand saw the most amazing sight:
p245
aVthousands and thousands of pink flamingos,
p246
aVa literal pink carpet for as far as you could see.
p247
aa(lp248
V"That's success," he said.
p249
aV"Look at their bellies, pink.
p250
aVThey're feasting."
p251
aVFeasting? I was totally confused.
p252
aa(lp253
VI said, "Miguel, aren't they feasting on your fish?"
p254
aV(Laughter)
p255
aa(lp256
V"Yes," he said.
p257
aV(Laughter)
p258
aV"We lose 20 percent of our fish
p259
aVand fish eggs to birds.
p260
aVWell, last year, this property
p261
aVhad 600,000 birds on it,
p262
aVmore than 250 different species.
p263
aVIt's become, today, the largest
p264
aVand one of the most important
p265
aVprivate bird sanctuaries in all of Europe."
p266
aa(lp267
VI said, "Miguel, isn't a thriving bird population
p268
aVlike the last thing you want on a fish farm?"
p269
aV(Laughter)
p270
aVHe shook his head, no.
p271
aa(lp272
VHe said, "We farm extensively,
p273
aVnot intensively.
p274
aVThis is an ecological network.
p275
aVThe flamingos eat the shrimp.
p276
aVThe shrimp eat the phytoplankton.
p277
aVSo the pinker the belly,
p278
aVthe better the system."
p279
aa(lp280
VOkay, so let's review:
p281
aVa farm that doesn't feed its animals,
p282
aVand a farm that measures its success
p283
aVon the health of its predators.
p284
aVA fish farm, but also a bird sanctuary.
p285
aVOh, and by the way, those flamingos,
p286
aVthey shouldn't even be there in the first place.
p287
aVThey brood in a town
p288
aV150 miles away,
p289
aVwhere the soil conditions
p290
aVare better for building nests.
p291
aVEvery morning, they fly
p292
aV150 miles into the farm.
p293
aVAnd every evening, they fly 150 miles back.
p294
aV(Laughter)
p295
aVThey do that because they're able to follow
p296
aVthe broken white line
p297
aVof highway A92.
p298
aV(Laughter)
p299
aVNo kidding.
p300
aa(lp301
VI was imagining a "March of the Penguins" thing,
p302
aVso I looked at Miguel.
p303
aVI said, "Miguel, do they fly
p304
aV150 miles to the farm,
p305
aVand then do they fly
p306
aV150 miles back at night?
p307
aVDo they do that for the children?"
p308
aa(lp309
VHe looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song.
p310
aV(Laughter)
p311
aVHe said, "No; they do it because the food's better."
p312
aV(Laughter)
p313
aa(lp314
VI didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish,
p315
aVwhich was delicious \u2014 and I don't like fish skin;
p316
aVI don't like it seared, I don't like it crispy.
p317
aVIt's that acrid, tar-like flavor.
p318
aVI almost never cook with it.
p319
aVYet, when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain,
p320
aVit tasted not at all like fish skin.
p321
aVIt tasted sweet and clean,
p322
aVlike you were taking a bite of the ocean.
p323
aVI mentioned that to Miguel, and he nodded.
p324
aVHe said, "The skin acts like a sponge.
p325
aVIt's the last defense before anything enters the body.
p326
aVIt evolved to soak up impurities."
p327
aVAnd then he added,
p328
aV"But our water has no impurities."
p329
aa(lp330
VOK. A farm that doesn't feed its fish,
p331
aVa farm that measures its success
p332
aVby the success of its predators.
p333
aVAnd then I realized when he says,
p334
aV"A farm that has no impurities,"
p335
aVhe made a big understatement,
p336
aVbecause the water that flows through that farm
p337
aVcomes in from the Guadalquivir River.
p338
aVIt's a river that carries with it
p339
aVall the things that rivers tend to carry these days:
p340
aVchemical contaminants,
p341
aVpesticide runoff.
p342
aVAnd when it works its way through the system
p343
aVand leaves,
p344
aVthe water is cleaner than when it entered.
p345
aVThe system is so healthy, it purifies the water.
p346
aVSo, not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals,
p347
aVnot just a farm that measures its success
p348
aVby the health of its predators,
p349
aVbut a farm that's literally a water purification plant \u2014
p350
aVand not just for those fish,
p351
aVbut for you and me as well.
p352
aVBecause when that water leaves, it dumps out into the Atlantic.
p353
aVA drop in the ocean, I know,
p354
aVbut I'll take it, and so should you,
p355
aVbecause this love story,
p356
aVhowever romantic,
p357
aVis also instructive.
p358
aVYou might say it's a recipe
p359
aVfor the future of good food,
p360
aVwhether we're talking about bass or beef cattle.
p361
aa(lp362
VWhat we need now is
p363
aVa radically new conception of agriculture,
p364
aVone in which the food actually tastes good.
p365
aV(Laughter)
p366
aV(Applause)
p367
aVBut for a lot people,
p368
aVthat's a bit too radical.
p369
aVWe're not realists, us foodies;
p370
aVwe're lovers.
p371
aVWe love farmers' markets,
p372
aVwe love small family farms,
p373
aVwe talk about local food,
p374
aVwe eat organic.
p375
aVAnd when you suggest these are the things
p376
aVthat will ensure the future of good food,
p377
aVsomeone, somewhere stands up and says,
p378
aV"Hey guy, I love pink flamingos,
p379
aVbut how are you going to feed the world?"
p380
aVHow are you going to feed the world?
p381
aa(lp382
VCan I be honest?
p383
aVI don't love that question.
p384
aVNo, not because we already produce
p385
aVenough calories to more than feed the world.
p386
aVOne billion people will go hungry today.
p387
aVOne billion \u2014 that's more than ever before \u2014
p388
aVbecause of gross inequalities in distribution,
p389
aVnot tonnage.
p390
aVNow, I don't love this question because it's determined the logic
p391
aVof our food system for the last 50 years.
p392
aa(lp393
VFeed grain to herbivores,
p394
aVpesticides to monocultures, chemicals to soil,
p395
aVchicken to fish,
p396
aVand all along agribusiness
p397
aVhas simply asked,
p398
aV"If we're feeding more people more cheaply,
p399
aVhow terrible could that be?"
p400
aVThat's been the motivation,
p401
aVit's been the justification:
p402
aVit's been the business plan
p403
aVof American agriculture.
p404
aVWe should call it what it is:
p405
aVa business in liquidation,
p406
aVa business that's quickly eroding
p407
aVecological capital that makes that very production possible.
p408
aVThat's not a business,
p409
aVand it isn't agriculture.
p410
aa(lp411
VOur breadbasket is threatened today,
p412
aVnot because of diminishing supply,
p413
aVbut because of diminishing resources.
p414
aVNot by the latest combine and tractor invention,
p415
aVbut by fertile land;
p416
aVnot by pumps, but by fresh water;
p417
aVnot by chainsaws, but by forests;
p418
aVand not by fishing boats and nets, but by fish in the sea.
p419
aa(lp420
VWant to feed the world?
p421
aVLet's start by asking: How are we going to feed ourselves?
p422
aVOr better: How can we create conditions
p423
aVthat enable every community
p424
aVto feed itself?
p425
aV(Applause)
p426
aVTo do that,
p427
aVdon't look at the agribusiness model for the future.
p428
aVIt's really old, and it's tired.
p429
aVIt's high on capital, chemistry and machines,
p430
aVand it's never produced anything really good to eat.
p431
aVInstead, let's look to the ecological model.
p432
aVThat's the one that relies on two billion years
p433
aVof on-the-job experience.
p434
aa(lp435
VLook to Miguel,
p436
aVfarmers like Miguel.
p437
aVFarms that aren't worlds unto themselves;
p438
aVfarms that restore instead of deplete;
p439
aVfarms that farm extensively
p440
aVinstead of just intensively;
p441
aVfarmers that are not just producers,
p442
aVbut experts in relationships.
p443
aVBecause they're the ones
p444
aVthat are experts in flavor, too.
p445
aVAnd if I'm going to be really honest,
p446
aVthey're a better chef than I'll ever be.
p447
aVYou know, I'm okay with that,
p448
aVbecause if that's the future of good food, it's going to be delicious.
p449
aa(lp450
VThank you.

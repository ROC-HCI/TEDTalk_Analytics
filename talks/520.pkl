VWhen I was five years old
p5
aVI fell in love with airplanes.
p6
aVNow I'm talking about the '30s.
p7
aVIn the '30s an airplane had two wings
p8
aVand a round motor,
p9
aVand was always flown
p10
aVby a guy who looked like Cary Grant.
p11
aVHe had high leather boots,
p12
aVjodhpurs, an old leather jacket,
p13
aVa wonderful helmet
p14
aVand those marvelous goggles \u2014
p15
aVand, inevitably, a white scarf,
p16
aVto flow in the wind.
p17
aVHe'd always walk up to his airplane
p18
aVin a kind of saunter,
p19
aVdevil-may-care saunter,
p20
aVflick the cigarette away,
p21
aVgrab the girl waiting here, give her a kiss.
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aVAnd then mount his airplane,
p24
aVmaybe for the last time.
p25
aVOf course I always wondered what would happen
p26
aVif he'd kissed the airplane first.
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VBut this was real romance to me.
p30
aVEverything about flying in those years,
p31
aVwhich was \u2014 you have to stop and think for a moment \u2014
p32
aVwas probably the most advanced
p33
aVtechnological thing going on at the time.
p34
aVSo as a youngster,
p35
aVI tried to get close to this
p36
aVby drawing airplanes,
p37
aVconstantly drawing airplanes.
p38
aVIt's the way I got
p39
aVa part of this romance.
p40
aVAnd of course, in a way, when I say romance,
p41
aVI mean in part
p42
aVthe aesthetics of that whole situation.
p43
aVI think the word is the holistic experience
p44
aVrevolving around a product.
p45
aVThe product was that airplane.
p46
aVBut it built a romance.
p47
aVEven the parts of the airplane
p48
aVhad French names.
p49
aVZe fuselage, ze empanage, ze nessal.
p50
aVYou know, from a romance language.
p51
aVSo that it was something that just got into your spirit.
p52
aVIt did mine.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd I decided I had to get closer than
p55
aVjust drawing fantasy airplanes.
p56
aVI wanted to build airplanes.
p57
aVSo I built model airplanes.
p58
aVAnd I found that in doing the model airplanes
p59
aVthe appearance drawings were not enough.
p60
aVYou couldn't transfer those
p61
aVto the model itself.
p62
aVIf you wanted it to fly
p63
aVyou had to learn the discipline
p64
aVof flying.
p65
aVYou had to learn about aeronautics.
p66
aVYou had to learn what made an airplane
p67
aVstay in the air.
p68
aVAnd of course, as a model in those years, you couldn't control it.
p69
aVSo it had to be self-righting,
p70
aVand stay up without crashing.
p71
aVSo I had to give up
p72
aVthe approach of drawing
p73
aVthe fantasy shapes
p74
aVand convert it to technical drawings \u2014
p75
aVthe shape of the wing, the shape of the fuselage and so on \u2014
p76
aVand build an airplane over these drawings
p77
aVthat I knew followed some of the principles
p78
aVof flying.
p79
aVAnd in so doing, I could produce
p80
aVa model that would fly, stay in the air.
p81
aVAnd it had, once it was in the air,
p82
aVsome of this romance that I was in love with.
p83
aa(lp84
VWell the act of drawing airplanes
p85
aVled me to,
p86
aVwhen I had the opportunity to choose
p87
aVa course in school,
p88
aVled me to sign up for aeronautical engineering.
p89
aVAnd when I was sitting in classes \u2014
p90
aVin which no one asked me to draw an airplane \u2014
p91
aVto my surprise.
p92
aVI had to learn mathematics and mechanics
p93
aVand all this sort of thing.
p94
aVI'd wile away my time drawing airplanes
p95
aVin the class.
p96
aVOne day a young man looked over my shoulder,
p97
aVhe said, "You draw very well.
p98
aVYou should be in the art department."
p99
aVAnd I said, "Why?"
p100
aVAnd he said, "Well for one thing, there are more girls there."
p101
aV(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VSo my romance was temporarily shifted.
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aVAnd I went into art
p106
aVbecause they appreciated drawing.
p107
aVStudied painting; didn't do very well at that.
p108
aVWent through design,
p109
aVsome architecture.
p110
aVEventually hired myself out as a designer.
p111
aVAnd for the following 25 years,
p112
aVliving in Italy,
p113
aVliving in America,
p114
aVI doled out a piece of this romance
p115
aVto anybody who'd pay for it \u2014
p116
aVthis sense, this aesthetic feeling,
p117
aVfor the experience revolving around
p118
aVa designed object.
p119
aVAnd it exists.
p120
aVAny of you who rode the automobiles \u2014
p121
aVwas it yesterday? \u2014
p122
aVat the track, you know the romance
p123
aVrevolving around those high performance cars.
p124
aa(lp125
VWell in 25 years
p126
aVI was mostly putting out
p127
aVpieces of this romance
p128
aVand not getting a lot back in
p129
aVbecause design on call
p130
aVdoesn't always connect you with a circumstance
p131
aVin which you can produce things of this nature.
p132
aVSo after 25 years I began to feel
p133
aVas though I was running dry.
p134
aVAnd I quit.
p135
aVAnd I started up a very small operation \u2014
p136
aVwent from 40 people
p137
aVto one,
p138
aVin an effort to rediscover my innocence.
p139
aVI wanted to get back
p140
aVwhere the romance was.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd I couldn't choose airplanes
p143
aVbecause they had gotten sort of unromantic
p144
aVat that point,
p145
aVeven though I'd done a lot of airplane work,
p146
aVon the interiors.
p147
aVSo I chose furniture.
p148
aVAnd I chose chairs specifically
p149
aVbecause I knew something about them.
p150
aVI'd designed a lot of chairs, over the years
p151
aVfor tractors and trucks
p152
aVand submarines \u2014
p153
aVall kinds of things.
p154
aVBut not office chairs.
p155
aVSo I started doing that.
p156
aVAnd I found that there were ways
p157
aVto duplicate the same approach
p158
aVthat I used to use on the airplane.
p159
aVOnly this time,
p160
aVinstead of the product being shaped by the wind,
p161
aVit was shaped by the human body.
p162
aVSo the discipline was \u2014
p163
aVas in the airplane you learn a lot about
p164
aVhow to deal with the air,
p165
aVfor a chair
p166
aVyou have to learn a lot about how to deal
p167
aVwith the body,
p168
aVand what the body needs, wants,
p169
aVindicates it needs.
p170
aVAnd that's the way, ultimately
p171
aVafter some ups and downs,
p172
aVI ended up designing the chair I'm going to show you.
p173
aa(lp174
VI should say one more thing. When I was doing those
p175
aVmodel airplanes,
p176
aVI did everything.
p177
aVI conceived the kind of airplane.
p178
aVI basically engineered it.
p179
aVI built it.
p180
aVAnd I flew it.
p181
aVAnd that's the way I work now.
p182
aVWhen I started this chair
p183
aVit was not a preconceived notion.
p184
aVDesign nowadays, if you mean it,
p185
aVyou don't start with styling sketches.
p186
aVI started with a lot of loose ideas,
p187
aVroughly eight or nine years ago.
p188
aVAnd the loose ideas had something
p189
aVto do with what I knew happened with
p190
aVpeople in the office,
p191
aVat the work place \u2014 people who worked,
p192
aVand used task seating,
p193
aVa great many of them sitting in front of a computer
p194
aVall day long.
p195
aVAnd I felt,
p196
aVthe one thing they don't need,
p197
aVis a chair that interferes
p198
aVwith their main reason for sitting there.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo I took the approach
p201
aVthat the chair should do as much for them
p202
aVas humanly possible
p203
aVor as mechanistically possible
p204
aVso that they didn't have to fuss with it.
p205
aVSo my idea was that,
p206
aVinstead of sitting down and reaching
p207
aVfor a lot of controls,
p208
aVthat you would sit on the chair,
p209
aVand it would automatically balance your weight
p210
aVagainst the force required
p211
aVto recline.
p212
aVNow that may not mean a lot to some of you.
p213
aVBut you know most good chairs do recline
p214
aVbecause it's beneficial to open up this joint
p215
aVbetween your legs and your upper body
p216
aVfor better breathing
p217
aVand better flow.
p218
aVSo that if you sit down
p219
aVon my chair,
p220
aVwhether you're five feet tall
p221
aVor six foot six,
p222
aVit always deals with your weight
p223
aVand transfers the amount of force required
p224
aVto recline
p225
aVin a way that you don't have to look
p226
aVfor something to adjust.
p227
aa(lp228
VI'll tell you right up front,
p229
aVthis is a trade off.
p230
aVThere are drawbacks to this.
p231
aVOne is: you can't
p232
aVaccommodate everybody.
p233
aVThere are some very light people,
p234
aVsome extremely heavy people,
p235
aVmaybe people with a lot of bulk up top.
p236
aVThey begin to fall off the end of your chart.
p237
aVBut the compromise, I felt,
p238
aVwas in my favor
p239
aVbecause most people don't adjust their chairs.
p240
aVThey will sit in them forever.
p241
aVI had somebody on the bus out to the racetrack
p242
aVtell me about his sister calling him.
p243
aVHe said she had one of the new, better chairs.
p244
aVShe said, "Oh I love it."
p245
aVShe said, "But it's too high."
p246
aV(Laughter)
p247
aVSo he said, "Well I'll come over and look at it."
p248
aVHe came over and looked at it.
p249
aVHe reached down. He pulled a lever. And the chair sank down.
p250
aVShe said, "Oh it's wonderful. How did you do that?"
p251
aVAnd he showed her the lever.
p252
aVWell, that's typical
p253
aVof a lot of us working in chairs.
p254
aVAnd why should you
p255
aVget a 20-page manual
p256
aVabout how to run a chair?
p257
aV(Laughter)
p258
aVI had one for a wristwatch once. 20 pages.
p259
aa(lp260
VAnyway, I felt that it was important
p261
aVthat you didn't have to make an adjustment
p262
aVin order to get this kind of action.
p263
aVThe other thing I felt was that armrests
p264
aVhad never really been properly approached
p265
aVfrom the standpoint of how much
p266
aVof an aid they could be
p267
aVto your work life.
p268
aVBut I felt it was too much to ask
p269
aVto have to adjust each individual armrest
p270
aVin order to get it where you wanted.
p271
aVSo I spent a long time.
p272
aVI said I worked eight or nine years on it.
p273
aVAnd each of these things went along
p274
aVsort of in parallel
p275
aVbut incrementally were a problem of their own.
p276
aVI worked a long time on figuring out
p277
aVhow to move the arms over a much greater arc \u2014
p278
aVthat is up and down \u2014
p279
aVand make them a lot easier,
p280
aVso that you didn't have to use a button.
p281
aVAnd so after many trials, many failures,
p282
aVwe came up with a very simple arrangement
p283
aVin which we could just move
p284
aVone arm or the other.
p285
aVAnd they go up easily.
p286
aVAnd stop where you want.
p287
aVYou can put them down, essentially out of the way.
p288
aVNo arms at all.
p289
aVOr you can pull them up where you want them.
p290
aVAnd this was another thing that I felt,
p291
aVwhile not nearly as romantic
p292
aVas Cary Grant,
p293
aVnevertheless begins to
p294
aVgrab a little bit of aesthetic
p295
aVoperation, aesthetic performance
p296
aVinto a product.
p297
aa(lp298
VThe next area that was of interest to me
p299
aVwas the fact that reclining
p300
aVwas a very important factor.
p301
aVAnd the more you can recline,
p302
aVin a way, the better it is.
p303
aVThe more the angle between here and here opens up \u2014
p304
aVand nowadays, with a screen in front of you,
p305
aVyou don't want to have your eye drop too far in the recline,
p306
aVso we keep it at more or less the same level \u2014
p307
aVbut you transfer weight
p308
aVoff your tailbones.
p309
aVWould everybody put their hand under their bottom
p310
aVand feel their tailbone?
p311
aV(Laughter)
p312
aVYou feel that bone under there?
p313
aV(Laughter)
p314
aVJust your own.
p315
aV(Laughter)
p316
aVThere's two of them, one on either side.
p317
aVAll the weight of your upper torso \u2014
p318
aVyour arms, your head \u2014
p319
aVgoes right down through your back,
p320
aVyour spine, into those bones when you sit.
p321
aVAnd that's a lot of load.
p322
aVJust relieving your arms with armrests
p323
aVtakes 20 percent of that load off.
p324
aVNow that, if your spine is not held in a good position,
p325
aVwill help bend your spine the wrong way, and so on.
p326
aVSo to unload
p327
aVthat great weight \u2014
p328
aVif that indeed exists \u2014
p329
aVyou can recline.
p330
aVWhen you recline you take away a lot of that load
p331
aVoff your bottom end, and transfer it to your back.
p332
aVAt the same time, as I say, you open up this joint.
p333
aVAnd breathability is good.
p334
aa(lp335
VBut to do that, if you have any
p336
aVamount of recline,
p337
aVit gets to the point where you need a headrest
p338
aVbecause nearly always,
p339
aVautomatically hold your head
p340
aVin a vertical position, see?
p341
aVAs I recline, my head says more or less vertical.
p342
aVWell if you're reclined a great deal,
p343
aVyou have to use muscle force
p344
aVto hold your head there.
p345
aVSo that's where a headrest comes in.
p346
aVNow headrest is a challenge
p347
aVbecause you want it to adjust
p348
aVenough so that it'll fit,
p349
aVyou know, a tall guy and a short girl.
p350
aVSo here we are.
p351
aVI've got five inches of adjustment here
p352
aVin order to get the headrest in the right place.
p353
aVBut then I knew from experience
p354
aVand looking around in offices
p355
aVwhere there were chairs with headrests
p356
aVthat nobody would ever bother
p357
aVto reach back and turn a knob
p358
aVand adjust the headrest to put it in position.
p359
aVAnd you need it in a different position
p360
aVwhen you're upright, then when you're reclined.
p361
aVSo I knew that had to be solved, and had to be automatic.
p362
aVSo if you watch this chair
p363
aVas I recline, the headrest comes up
p364
aVto meet my neck.
p365
aVIdeally you want to put the head support
p366
aVin the cranial area, right there.
p367
aVSo that part of it took a long time
p368
aVto work out.
p369
aa(lp370
VAnd there is a variety of other things: the shape of the cushions,
p371
aVthe gel we put.
p372
aVWe stole the idea from bicycle seats,
p373
aVand put gel in the cushions
p374
aVand in the armrests
p375
aVto absorb point load \u2014
p376
aVdistributes the loading so you don't get hard spots.
p377
aVYou cant hit your elbow
p378
aVon bottom.
p379
aVAnd I did want to demonstrate
p380
aVthe fact that the chair can accommodate people.
p381
aVWhile you're sitting in it you can adjust it
p382
aVdown for the five-footer,
p383
aVor you can adjust it
p384
aVfor the six-foot-six guy \u2014
p385
aVall within the scope of a few simple adjustments.

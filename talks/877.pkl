VHi there.
p5
aVI'm going to be talking a little bit about
p6
aVmusic, machines and life.
p7
aVOr, more specifically,
p8
aVwhat we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine
p9
aVfor a music video.
p10
aVSome of you may recognize this image.
p11
aVThis is the opening frame of the video that we created.
p12
aVWe'll be showing the video at the end,
p13
aVbut before we do, I want to talk a little bit about
p14
aVwhat it is that they wanted.
p15
aa(lp16
VNow, when we first started talking to OK Go \u2014
p17
aVthe name of the song is "This Too Shall Pass" \u2014
p18
aVwe were really excited because
p19
aVthey expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with.
p20
aVAnd we were very excited about this
p21
aVbecause, of course,
p22
aVthey have a history of dancing with machines.
p23
aVThey're responsible for this video, "Here It Goes Again."
p24
aV50-million-plus views on YouTube.
p25
aVFour guys dancing on treadmills,
p26
aVno cuts, just a static camera.
p27
aVA fantastically viral and wonderful video.
p28
aVSo we were really excited about working with them.
p29
aVAnd we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted.
p30
aVAnd they explained that they wanted
p31
aVkind of a Rube Goldberg machine.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow, for those of you who don't know,
p34
aVa Rube Goldberg machine
p35
aVis a complicated contraption,
p36
aVan incredibly over-engineered piece of machinery
p37
aVthat accomplishes a relatively simple task.
p38
aVSo we were excited by this idea,
p39
aVand we started talking about
p40
aVexactly what it would look like.
p41
aVAnd we came up with some parameters, because,
p42
aVyou know, building a Rube Goldberg machine
p43
aVhas limitations,
p44
aVbut it also is pretty wide open.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd we wanted to make sure that we did something
p47
aVthat would work for a music video.
p48
aVSo we came up with a list of requirements,
p49
aVthe "10 commandments,"
p50
aVand they were, in order of ascending difficulty:
p51
aVThe first is "No magic."
p52
aVEverything that happened on screen had to be
p53
aVvery easily understood by a typical viewer.
p54
aVThe rule of thumb was that, if my mother couldn't understand it,
p55
aVthen we couldn't use it in the video.
p56
aVThey wanted band integration,
p57
aVthat is, the machine acting upon the band members,
p58
aVspecifically not the other way around.
p59
aVThey wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling.
p60
aVSo as the song picks up emotion,
p61
aVso should the machine
p62
aVget grander in its process.
p63
aVThey wanted us to make use of the space.
p64
aVSo we have this 10,000-square-foot warehouse we were using,
p65
aVdivided between two floors.
p66
aVIt included an exterior loading dock.
p67
aVWe used all of that, including a giant hole in the floor
p68
aVthat we actually descended the camera and cameraman through.
p69
aVThey wanted it messy, and we were happy to oblige.
p70
aVThe machine itself would start the music.
p71
aVSo the machine would get started,
p72
aVit would travel some distance,
p73
aVreacting along the way,
p74
aVhit play on an iPod or a tape deck
p75
aVor something that would start playback.
p76
aVAnd the machine would maintain synchronization throughout.
p77
aVAnd speaking of synchronization,
p78
aVthey wanted it to sync to the rhythm
p79
aVand to hit specific beats along the way.
p80
aVOkay. (Laughter)
p81
aVThey wanted it to end precisely on time.
p82
aVOkay, so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect.
p83
aVAnd they wanted the music to drop out
p84
aVat a certain point in the video
p85
aVand actual live audio from the machine
p86
aVto play part of the song.
p87
aVAnd as if that wasn't enough,
p88
aVall of these incredibly complicating things, right,
p89
aVthey wanted it in one shot.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
V(Applause)
p94
aa(lp95
VOkay.
p96
aVSo, just some statistics
p97
aVabout what we went through in the process.
p98
aVThe machine itself has
p99
aV89 distinct interactions.
p100
aVIt took us 85 takes
p101
aVto get it on film
p102
aVto our satisfaction.
p103
aVOf those 85 takes,
p104
aVonly three actually successfully completed their run.
p105
aVWe destroyed two pianos
p106
aVand 10 televisions in the process.
p107
aVWe went to Home Depot well over a hundred times.
p108
aV(Laughter)
p109
aVAnd we lost one high-heeled shoe
p110
aVwhen one of our engineers, Heather Knight,
p111
aVleft her high-heeled shoe \u2014 after a nice dinner,
p112
aVand returned back to the build \u2014
p113
aVand left it in a pile of stuff.
p114
aVAnd another engineer thought, "Well, that would be a really good thing to use"
p115
aVand ended up using it as a really nice trigger.
p116
aVAnd it's actually in the machine.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo what did we learn from all of this?
p119
aVWell, having completed this,
p120
aVwe have the opportunity to step back and reflect
p121
aVon some of the things.
p122
aVAnd we learned that small stuff stinks.
p123
aVLittle balls in wooden tracks
p124
aVare really susceptible to
p125
aVhumidity and temperature and a little bit of dust,
p126
aVand they fall out of the tracks,
p127
aVthe exact angles makes it hard to get right.
p128
aVAnd yet, a bowling ball will always follow the same path.
p129
aVIt doesn't matter what temperature it is,
p130
aVdoesn't matter what's in its way;
p131
aVit will pretty much get where it needs to go.
p132
aVBut as much as the small stuff stinks, we needed somewhere to start,
p133
aVso that we would have somewhere to go.
p134
aVAnd so you have to start with it. You have to focus on it.
p135
aVSmall stuff stinks,
p136
aVbut, of course, it's essential, right?
p137
aa(lp138
VWhat else? Planning is incredibly important.
p139
aV(Laughter)
p140
aVYou know, we spent a lot of time ideating
p141
aVand even building some of these things.
p142
aVIt's been said that, "No battle plan
p143
aVsurvives contact with the enemy."
p144
aVI think our enemy was physics \u2014
p145
aV(Laughter)
p146
aVand she's a cruel mistress.
p147
aVOften, we had to pull things out as a result
p148
aVbecause of timing or aesthetics or whatever.
p149
aVAnd so while planning is important, so is flexibility.
p150
aVThese are all things that ended up
p151
aVnot making it into the final machine.
p152
aVSo also, put reliable stuff last,
p153
aVthe stuff that's going to run every time.
p154
aVAgain, small to large is relevant here.
p155
aVThe little Lego car in the beginning of the video
p156
aVreferences the big, real car
p157
aVnear the end of the video.
p158
aVThe big, real car works every time; there's no problem about it.
p159
aVThe little one had a tendency to try to run off the track
p160
aVand that's a problem.
p161
aVBut you don't want to have to reset the whole machine
p162
aVbecause the Lego car at the end doesn't work, right.
p163
aVSo you put that up front so that, if it fails,
p164
aVat least you know
p165
aVyou don't have to reset the whole thing.
p166
aa(lp167
VLife can be
p168
aVmessy.
p169
aVThere were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing.
p170
aVMonths were spent in this tiny, cold warehouse.
p171
aVAnd the wonderful elation that we had
p172
aVwhen we finally completed it.
p173
aVSo it's important to remember that whether it's good or it's bad,
p174
aV"This Too Shall Pass."
p175
aa(lp176
VThank you very much.
p177
aa(lp178
V(Applause)
p179
aVAnd now to introduce
p180
aa(lp181
Vtheir music video,
p182
aVwe have OK Go.
p183
aa(lp184
VOK Go: An introduction. Hello TEDxUSC.
p185
aVWe are OK Go.
p186
aVWhat are we doing? Oh, just hanging out with our Grammy. What what!
p187
aVIt think we can do better than this. Hello TEDxUSC.
p188
aVWe are OK Go. Have you read the "Natural Curiosity Cabinet?"
p189
aVI mean, "Curiosity" \u2014 excuse me.
p190
aVLet me start again.
p191
aVWe need some more ridiculous things besides "The Cabinet of Natural Curiosities."
p192
aVTim's sundial hat.
p193
aVHave you seen the new work they've done to the Waltz Towers?
p194
aVSorry, start again.
p195
aV(Barking)
p196
aVDogs.
p197
aVHello, TEDxUSC. We are OK Go,
p198
aVand this our new video, "This Too Shall Pass."
p199
aV[unclear]
p200
aVKay, we can still do one better I think, yeah.
p201
aVThat one's pretty good. It's getting better.

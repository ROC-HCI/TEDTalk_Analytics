VThis is a representation of your brain,
p5
aVand your brain can be broken into two parts.
p6
aVThere's the left half, which is the logical side,
p7
aVand then the right half,
p8
aVwhich is the intuitive.
p9
aVAnd so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere,
p10
aVthen we can plot our brain.
p11
aVAnd for example, this would be somebody who's completely logical.
p12
aVThis would be someone who's entirely intuitive.
p13
aVSo where would you put your brain on this scale?
p14
aVSome of us may have opted for one of these extremes,
p15
aVbut I think for most people in the audience,
p16
aVyour brain is something like this \u2014
p17
aVwith a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time.
p18
aVIt's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything.
p19
aVYou can be logical and intuitive.
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd so I consider myself one of these people,
p22
aValong with most of the other experimental quantum physicists,
p23
aVwho need a good deal of logic
p24
aVto string together these complex ideas.
p25
aVBut at the same time, we need a good deal of intuition
p26
aVto actually make the experiments work.
p27
aVHow do we develop this intuition? Well we like to play with stuff.
p28
aVSo we go out and play with it, and then we see how it acts,
p29
aVand then we develop our intuition from there.
p30
aVAnd really you do the same thing.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo some intuition
p33
aVthat you may have developed over the years
p34
aVis that one thing is only in one place at a time.
p35
aVI mean, it can sound weird to think about
p36
aVone thing being in two different places at the same time,
p37
aVbut you weren't born with this notion, you developed it.
p38
aVAnd I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop.
p39
aVHe was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it, and he kept falling over.
p40
aVBut I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson,
p41
aVand that's that large things don't let you get right past them,
p42
aVand that they stay in one place.
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world,
p45
aVunless you're a particle physicist.
p46
aVIt'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist,
p47
aVbecause they don't play with car stops,
p48
aVthey play with these little weird particles.
p49
aVAnd when they play with their particles,
p50
aVthey find they do all sorts of really weird things \u2014
p51
aVlike they can fly right through walls,
p52
aVor they can be in two different places at the same time.
p53
aVAnd so they wrote down all these observations,
p54
aVand they called it the theory of quantum mechanics.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd so that's where physics was at a few years ago;
p57
aVyou needed quantum mechanics
p58
aVto describe little, tiny particles.
p59
aVBut you didn't need it
p60
aVto describe the large, everyday objects around us.
p61
aVThis didn't really sit well with my intuition,
p62
aVand maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often.
p63
aVWell, I play with them sometimes,
p64
aVbut not very often.
p65
aVAnd I've never seen them.
p66
aVI mean, nobody's ever seen a particle.
p67
aVBut it didn't sit well with my logical side either.
p68
aVBecause if everything is made up of little particles
p69
aVand all the little particles
p70
aVfollow quantum mechanics,
p71
aVthen shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics?
p72
aVI don't see any reason why it shouldn't.
p73
aVAnd so I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing
p74
aVif we could somehow show
p75
aVthat an everyday object
p76
aValso follows quantum mechanics.
p77
aVSo a few years ago, I set off to do just that.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo I made one.
p80
aVThis is the first object
p81
aVthat you can see
p82
aVthat has been in a mechanical quantum superposition.
p83
aVSo what we're looking at here
p84
aVis a tiny computer chip.
p85
aVAnd you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle.
p86
aVAnd that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute.
p87
aVThis is a photograph of the object.
p88
aVAnd here I'll zoom in a little bit. We're looking right there in the center.
p89
aVAnd then here's a really, really big close-up of the little piece of metal.
p90
aVSo what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal,
p91
aVand it's shaped like a diving board, and it's sticking out over a ledge.
p92
aVAnd so I made this thing
p93
aVin nearly the same way as you make a computer chip.
p94
aVI went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer,
p95
aVand then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours.
p96
aVFor the last stuff, I had to build my own machine \u2014
p97
aVto make this swimming pool-shaped hole
p98
aVunderneath the device.
p99
aVThis device has the ability
p100
aVto be in a quantum superposition,
p101
aVbut it needs a little help to do it.
p102
aa(lp103
VHere, let me give you an analogy.
p104
aVYou know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator?
p105
aVI mean, when I'm in an elevator all alone, I do all sorts of weird things,
p106
aVbut then other people get on board
p107
aVand I stop doing those things
p108
aVbecause I don't want to bother them,
p109
aVor, frankly, scare them.
p110
aVSo quantum mechanics says
p111
aVthat inanimate objects feel the same way.
p112
aVThe fellow passengers for inanimate objects
p113
aVare not just people,
p114
aVbut it's also the light shining on it
p115
aVand the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room.
p116
aVAnd so we knew, if we wanted to see
p117
aVthis piece of metal behave quantum mechanically,
p118
aVwe're going to have to kick out all the other passengers.
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd so that's what we did.
p121
aVWe turned off the lights,
p122
aVand then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air,
p123
aVand then we cooled it down
p124
aVto just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero.
p125
aVNow, all alone in the elevator,
p126
aVthe little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted.
p127
aVAnd so we measured its motion.
p128
aVWe found it was moving in really weird ways.
p129
aVInstead of just sitting perfectly still, it was vibrating,
p130
aVand the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this \u2014
p131
aVlike expanding and contracting bellows.
p132
aVAnd by giving it a gentle nudge,
p133
aVwe were able to make it both vibrate
p134
aVand not vibrate
p135
aVat the same time \u2014
p136
aVsomething that's only allowed with quantum mechanics.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic.
p139
aVWhat does it mean for one thing
p140
aVto be both vibrating and not vibrating
p141
aVat the same time?
p142
aVSo let's think about the atoms.
p143
aVSo in one case:
p144
aVall the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal
p145
aVare sitting still
p146
aVand at the same time those same atoms
p147
aVare moving up and down.
p148
aVNow it's only at precise times when they align.
p149
aVThe rest of the time they're delocalized.
p150
aVThat means that every atom
p151
aVis in two different places at the same time,
p152
aVwhich in turn means the entire chunk of metal
p153
aVis in two different places.
p154
aVI think this is really cool.
p155
aV(Laughter)
p156
aVReally.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Applause)
p159
aa(lp160
VIt was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years
p161
aVbecause, check this out,
p162
aVthe difference in scale
p163
aVbetween a single atom and that chunk of metal
p164
aVis about the same as the difference
p165
aVbetween that chunk of metal and you.
p166
aVSo if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time,
p167
aVthat chunk of metal can be in two different places,
p168
aVthen why not you?
p169
aVI mean, this is just my logical side talking.
p170
aVSo imagine if you're in multiple places at the same time,
p171
aVwhat would that be like?
p172
aVHow would your consciousness
p173
aVhandle your body being delocalized in space?
p174
aa(lp175
VThere's one more part to the story.
p176
aVIt's when we warmed it up,
p177
aVand we turned on the lights and looked inside the box,
p178
aVwe saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece.
p179
aVAnd so I had to develop this new intuition,
p180
aVthat it seems like all the objects in the elevator
p181
aVare really just quantum objects
p182
aVjust crammed into a tiny space.
p183
aa(lp184
VYou hear a lot of talk
p185
aVabout how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected.
p186
aVWell, that's not quite right.
p187
aVIt's more than that; it's deeper.
p188
aVIt's that those connections,
p189
aVyour connections to all the things around you,
p190
aVliterally define who you are,
p191
aVand that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics.
p192
aa(lp193
VThank you.

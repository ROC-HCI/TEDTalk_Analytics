VI thought I would read poems I have that relate to the subject
p5
aVof youth and age.
p6
aVI was sort of astonished to find out how many I have actually.
p7
aa(lp8
VThe first one is dedicated to
p9
aVSpencer, and his grandmother, who was shocked by his work.
p10
aVMy poem is called "Dirt."
p11
aa(lp12
VMy grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap;
p13
aa(lp14
Vhalf a long century gone
p15
aa(lp16
Vand still she comes at me
p17
aa(lp18
Vwith that thick cruel yellow bar.
p19
aa(lp20
VAll because of a word I said,
p21
aa(lp22
Vnot even said really, only repeated.
p23
aa(lp24
VBut "Open," she says, "open up!"
p25
aa(lp26
Vher hand clawing at my head.
p27
aa(lp28
VI know now her life was hard;
p29
aa(lp30
Vshe lost three children as babies,
p31
aa(lp32
Vthen her husband died too,
p33
aa(lp34
Vleaving young sons, and no money.
p35
aa(lp36
VShe'd stand me in the sink to pee
p37
aa(lp38
Vbecause there was never room in the toilet.
p39
aa(lp40
VBut oh, her soap!
p41
aa(lp42
VMight its bitter burning have been
p43
aVwhat made me a poet?
p44
aa(lp45
VThe street she lived on was unpaved,
p46
aa(lp47
Vher flat, two cramped rooms and a fetid kitchen
p48
aa(lp49
Vwhere she stalked and caught me.
p50
aa(lp51
VDare I admit that after she did it
p52
aa(lp53
VI never really loved her again?
p54
aa(lp55
VShe lived to a hundred,
p56
aa(lp57
Veven then. All along it was the sadness, the squalor,
p58
aa(lp59
Vbut I never, until now
p60
aa(lp61
Vloved her again.
p62
aa(lp63
VWhen that was published in a magazine
p64
aVI got an irate letter from my uncle.
p65
aV"You have maligned a great woman."
p66
aVIt took some diplomacy.
p67
aa(lp68
VThis is called "The Dress."
p69
aVIt's a longer poem.
p70
aa(lp71
VIn those days,
p72
aa(lp73
Vthose days which exist for me only
p74
aVas the most elusive memory now,
p75
aa(lp76
Vwhen often the first sound you'd hear in the morning
p77
aVwould be a storm of birdsong,
p78
aa(lp79
Vthen the soft clop of the hooves
p80
aVof the horse hauling a milk wagon down your block,
p81
aa(lp82
Vand the last sound at night as likely as not
p83
aa(lp84
Vwould be your father pulling up in his car,
p85
aa(lp86
Vhaving worked late again, always late,
p87
aa(lp88
Vand going heavily down to the cellar, to the furnace,
p89
aa(lp90
Vto shake out the ashes and damp the draft
p91
aVbefore he came upstairs to fall into bed \u2014
p92
aa(lp93
Vin those long-ago days,
p94
aa(lp95
Vwomen, my mother, my friends' mothers,
p96
aVour neighbors, all the women I knew \u2014
p97
aa(lp98
Vwore, often much of the day,
p99
aVwhat were called housedresses,
p100
aa(lp101
Vcheap, printed, pulpy,
p102
aVseemingly purposefully shapeless
p103
aVlight cotton shifts that you wore over your nightgown
p104
aa(lp105
Vand, when you had to go look for a child,
p106
aVhang wash on the line,
p107
aVor run down to the grocery store on the corner,
p108
aa(lp109
Vunder a coat,
p110
aVthe twisted hem of the nightgown
p111
aValways lank and yellowed,
p112
aVdangling beneath.
p113
aa(lp114
VMore than the curlers some of the women
p115
aVseemed constantly to have in their hair
p116
aVin preparation for some great event \u2014
p117
aa(lp118
Va ball, one would think \u2014
p119
aVthat never came to pass;
p120
aa(lp121
Vmore than the way most women's faces
p122
aVnot only were never made up during the day,
p123
aa(lp124
Vbut seemed scraped, bleached,
p125
aVand, with their plucked eyebrows, scarily masklike;
p126
aa(lp127
Vmore than all that it was those dresses
p128
aVthat made women so unknowable and forbidding,
p129
aa(lp130
Vadepts of enigmas to which men could have no access,
p131
aVand boys no conception.
p132
aa(lp133
VOnly later would I see the dresses also
p134
aVas a proclamation:
p135
aa(lp136
Vthat in your dim kitchen, your laundry,
p137
aVyour bleak concrete yard,
p138
aa(lp139
Vwhat you revealed of yourself
p140
aVwas a fabulation;
p141
aa(lp142
Vyour real sensual nature,
p143
aVveiled in those sexless vestments,
p144
aVwas utterly your dominion.
p145
aa(lp146
VIn those days, one hid much else as well:
p147
aa(lp148
Vgrown men didn't embrace one another,
p149
aVunless someone had died,
p150
aVand not always then; you shook hands
p151
aa(lp152
Vor, at a ball game, thumped your friend's back
p153
aVand exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection;
p154
aa(lp155
Vonce out of childhood you'd never again know
p156
aVthe shock of your father's whiskers on your cheek,
p157
aa(lp158
Vnot until mores at last had evolved,
p159
aVand you could hug another man, then hold on for a moment,
p160
aa(lp161
Vthen even kiss (your fathers bristles
p162
aVwhite and stiff now).
p163
aa(lp164
VWhat release finally, the embrace:
p165
aVthough we were wary \u2014 it seemed so audacious \u2014
p166
aa(lp167
Vhow much unspoken joy there was
p168
aVin that affirmation of equality and communion,
p169
aa(lp170
Vno matter how much misunderstanding
p171
aVand pain had passed between you by then.
p172
aa(lp173
VWe knew so little in those days,
p174
aVas little as now, I suppose
p175
aVabout healing those hurts:
p176
aa(lp177
Veven the women, in their best dresses,
p178
aVwith beads and sequins sewn on the bodices,
p179
aa(lp180
Veven in lipstick and mascara,
p181
aVtheir hair aflow,
p182
aVcould only stand wringing their hands,
p183
aVbegging for peace,
p184
aa(lp185
Vwhile father and son, like thugs,
p186
aVlike thieves, like Romans,
p187
aVsimmered and hissed and hated,
p188
aa(lp189
Vinflicting sorrows that endured,
p190
aVthe worst anyway,
p191
aVthrough the kiss and embrace,
p192
aa(lp193
Vbleeding from brother to brother,
p194
aVinto the generations.
p195
aa(lp196
VIn those days there was still countryside
p197
aVclose to the city, farms, cornfields, cows;
p198
aa(lp199
Veven not far from our building
p200
aVwith its blurred brick and long shadowy hallway
p201
aa(lp202
Vyou could find tracts with hills and trees
p203
aVyou could pretend were mountains and forests.
p204
aa(lp205
VOr you could go out by yourself
p206
aVeven to a half-block-long empty lot,
p207
aa(lp208
Vinto the bushes: like a creature of leaves you'd lurk,
p209
aa(lp210
Vcrouched, crawling, simplified, savage, alone;
p211
aa(lp212
Valready there was wanting to be simpler,
p213
aVwanting, when they called you,
p214
aa(lp215
Vnever to go back.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Applause)
p218
aa(lp219
VThis is another longish one,
p220
aVabout the old and the young.
p221
aVIt actually happened right at the time we met.
p222
aVPart of the poem takes place in
p223
aVspace we shared and time we shared.
p224
aa(lp225
VIt's called "The Neighbor."
p226
aa(lp227
VHer five horrid, deformed little dogs
p228
aVwho incessantly yap on the roof under my window.
p229
aa(lp230
VHer cats, God knows how many,
p231
aVwho must piss on her rugs \u2014
p232
aVher landing's a sickening reek.
p233
aa(lp234
VHer shadow once, fumbling the chain on her door,
p235
aVthen the door slamming fearfully shut,
p236
aa(lp237
Vonly the barking and the music \u2014 jazz \u2014
p238
aVfiltering as it does, day and night into the hall.
p239
aa(lp240
VThe time it was Chris Connor singing "Lush Life" \u2014
p241
aa(lp242
Vhow it brought back my college sweetheart,
p243
aa(lp244
Vmy first real love, who \u2014 till I left her \u2014
p245
aVplayed the same record.
p246
aa(lp247
VAnd head on my shoulder, hand on my thigh,
p248
aa(lp249
Vsang sweetly along, of regrets and depletions
p250
aVshe was too young for,
p251
aa(lp252
Vas I was too young, later, to believe in her pain.
p253
aa(lp254
VIt startled, then bored, then repelled me.
p255
aa(lp256
VMy starting to fancy she'd ended up in this fire-trap
p257
aVin the Village, that my neighbor was her.
p258
aa(lp259
VMy thinking we'd meet, recognize one another,
p260
aVbecome friends, that I'd accomplish a penance.
p261
aa(lp262
VMy seeing her, it wasn't her, at the mailbox.
p263
aa(lp264
VGray-yellow hair, army pants under a nightgown,
p265
aa(lp266
Vher turning away, hiding her ravaged face
p267
aVin her hands, muttering an inappropriate "Hi."
p268
aa(lp269
VSometimes there are frightening goings-on in the stairwell.
p270
aa(lp271
VA man shouting, "Shut up!" The dogs frantically snarling,
p272
aa(lp273
Vclaws scrabbling, then her \u2014 her voice
p274
aVhoarse, harsh, hollow,
p275
aValmost only a tone,
p276
aa(lp277
Vincoherent, a note, a squawk,
p278
aVbone on metal, metal gone molten,
p279
aa(lp280
Vcalling them back,
p281
aV"Come back darlings, come back dear ones.
p282
aVMy sweet angels, come back."
p283
aa(lp284
VMedea she was, next time I saw her.
p285
aa(lp286
VSorceress, tranced, ecstatic,
p287
aVstock-still on the sidewalk
p288
aa(lp289
Vragged coat hanging agape,
p290
aVpassersby flowing around her,
p291
aa(lp292
Vher mouth torn suddenly open
p293
aVas though in a scream,
p294
aa(lp295
Vsilently though, as though only in her brain
p296
aVor breast had it erupted.
p297
aa(lp298
VA cry so pure, practiced, detached,
p299
aVit had no need of a voice,
p300
aVor could no longer bear one.
p301
aa(lp302
VThese invisible links that allure,
p303
aVthese transfigurations, even of anguish, that hold us.
p304
aa(lp305
VThe girl, my old love,
p306
aVthe last lost time I saw her
p307
aa(lp308
Vwhen she came to find me at a party,
p309
aa(lp310
Vher drunkenly stumbling, falling,
p311
aVsprawling, skirt hiked, eyes veined red,
p312
aVswollen with tears, her shame,
p313
aVher dishonor.
p314
aa(lp315
VMy ignorant, arrogant coarseness,
p316
aVmy secret pride, my turning away.
p317
aa(lp318
VStill life on a rooftop,
p319
aVdead trees in barrels, a bench broken,
p320
aVdogs, excrement, sky.
p321
aa(lp322
VWhat pathways through pain,
p323
aVwhat junctures of vulnerability,
p324
aVwhat crossings and counterings?
p325
aa(lp326
VToo many lives in our lives already,
p327
aVtoo many chances for sorrow,
p328
aVtoo many unaccounted-for pasts.
p329
aa(lp330
V"Behold me," the god of frenzied,
p331
aVinexhaustible love says,
p332
aVrising in bloody splendor, "Behold me."
p333
aa(lp334
VHer making her way
p335
aVdown the littered vestibule stairs,
p336
aVone agonized step at a time.
p337
aa(lp338
VMy holding the door.
p339
aa(lp340
VHer crossing the fragmented tiles,
p341
aVfaltering at the step to the street,
p342
aa(lp343
Vdroning, not looking at me,
p344
aV"Can you help me?"
p345
aa(lp346
VTaking my arm, leaning lightly against me.
p347
aVHer wavering step into the world.
p348
aa(lp349
VHer whispering, "Thanks love." Lightly, lightly against me.
p350
aa(lp351
V(Applause)
p352
aa(lp353
VI think I'll lighten up a little.
p354
aV(Laughter)
p355
aVAnother, different kind of poem of youth and age.
p356
aa(lp357
VIt's called "Gas."
p358
aa(lp359
V(Laughter)
p360
aa(lp361
VWouldn't it be nice, I think,
p362
aa(lp363
Vwhen the blue-haired lady in the doctor's waiting room
p364
aVbends over the magazine table
p365
aa(lp366
Vand farts, just a little,
p367
aVand violently blushes.
p368
aa(lp369
VWouldn't it be nice if intestinal gas
p370
aVcame embodied in visible clouds,
p371
aa(lp372
Vso she could see that her really quite inoffensive pop
p373
aVhad only barely grazed my face
p374
aa(lp375
Vbefore it drifted away.
p376
aa(lp377
V(Laughter)
p378
aa(lp379
VBesides, for this to have happened now
p380
aVis a nice coincidence. Because not an hour ago,
p381
aVwhile we were on our walk,
p382
aa(lp383
Vmy dog was startled by a backfire
p384
aVand jumped straight up like a horse bucking.
p385
aa(lp386
VAnd that brought back to me the stable
p387
aVI worked on weekends when I was 12,
p388
aa(lp389
Vand a splendid piebald stallion,
p390
aa(lp391
Vwho whenever he was mounted would buck just like that,
p392
aVthough more hugely of course,
p393
aVenormous, gleaming, resplendent.
p394
aa(lp395
VAnd the woman, her face abashedly buried
p396
aVin her "Elle" now, reminded me \u2014
p397
aa(lp398
VI'd forgotten that not the least part of my awe
p399
aVconsisted of the fact that with every jump he took
p400
aa(lp401
Vthe horse would powerfully fart.
p402
aa(lp403
VPhwap! Phwap! Phwap!
p404
aa(lp405
VSomething never mentioned
p406
aVin the dozens of books about horses
p407
aVand their riders I devoured in those days.
p408
aa(lp409
VAll that savage grandeur,
p410
aVthe steely glinting hooves,
p411
aVthe eruptions driven from the creature's mighty innards,
p412
aa(lp413
Vbreath stopped, heart stopped, nostrils madly flared,
p414
aa(lp415
VI didn't know if I wanted to break him, or be him.
p416
aa(lp417
V(Laughter)
p418
aa(lp419
V(Applause)
p420
aa(lp421
VThis is called "Thirst."
p422
aVMany \u2014 most of my poems actually
p423
aVare urban poems. I happen to be reading a bunch that aren't.
p424
aa(lp425
V"Thirst."
p426
aa(lp427
VHere was my relation with the woman who lived all last autumn and winter,
p428
aa(lp429
Vday and night, on a bench
p430
aVin the 103rd Street subway station,
p431
aVuntil finally one day she vanished.
p432
aa(lp433
VWe regarded each other, scrutinized one another.
p434
aa(lp435
VMe shyly, obliquely, trying not to be furtive.
p436
aa(lp437
VShe boldly, unblinkingly, even pugnaciously,
p438
aVwrathfully even, when her bottle was empty.
p439
aa(lp440
VI was frightened of her. I felt like a child.
p441
aa(lp442
VI was afraid some repressed part of myself
p443
aVwould go out of control, and I'd be forever entrapped
p444
aa(lp445
Vin the shocking seethe of her stench.
p446
aa(lp447
VNot excrement merely, not merely surface
p448
aVand orifice going unwashed,
p449
aVrediffusion of rum,
p450
aa(lp451
Vthere was will in it,
p452
aVand intention, power and purpose \u2014
p453
aVa social, ethical rage and rebellion \u2014
p454
aa(lp455
Vdespair too, though, grief, loss.
p456
aa(lp457
VSometimes I'd think I should take her home with me,
p458
aVbathe her, comfort her, dress her.
p459
aa(lp460
VShe wouldn't have wanted me to, I would think.
p461
aVInstead, I'd step into my train.
p462
aa(lp463
VHow rich I would think, is the lexicon
p464
aVof our self-absolving.
p465
aa(lp466
VHow enduring, our bland fatal assurance
p467
aVthat reflection is righteousness being accomplished.
p468
aa(lp469
VThe dance of our glances,
p470
aVthe clash, pulling each other through
p471
aVour perceptual punctures,
p472
aa(lp473
Vthen holocaust, holocaust,
p474
aVhost on host of ill, injured presences,
p475
aVsquandered, consumed.
p476
aa(lp477
VHer vigil somewhere I know continues.
p478
aa(lp479
VHer occupancy, her absolute, faithful attendance.
p480
aa(lp481
VThe dance of our glances, challenge, abdication,
p482
aVeffacement, the perfume of our consternation.
p483
aa(lp484
V(Applause)
p485
aa(lp486
VThis is a newer poem, a brand new poem.
p487
aVThe title is "This Happened."
p488
aa(lp489
VA student, a young woman
p490
aVin a fourth-floor hallway of her lycee,
p491
aa(lp492
Vperched on the ledge of an open window
p493
aVchatting with friends between classes;
p494
aa(lp495
Va teacher passes and chides her,
p496
aV"Be careful, you might fall,"
p497
aValmost banteringly chides her,
p498
aa(lp499
V"You might fall,"
p500
aa(lp501
Vand the young woman, 18, a girl really,
p502
aa(lp503
Vthough she wouldn't think that,
p504
aVas brilliant as she is, first in her class,
p505
aVand "Beautiful, too," she's often told,
p506
aa(lp507
Vsmiles back, and leans into the open window,
p508
aVwhich wouldn't even be open if it were winter \u2014
p509
aa(lp510
Vif it were winter someone would have closed it ("Close it!") \u2014
p511
aa(lp512
Vleans into the window, farther, still smiling,
p513
aa(lp514
Vfarther and farther, though it takes less time
p515
aVthan this, really an instant, and lets herself fall.
p516
aa(lp517
VHerself fall.
p518
aa(lp519
VA casual impulse, a fancy,
p520
aVnever thought of until now, hardly thought of even now ...
p521
aa(lp522
VNo, more than impulse or fancy,
p523
aVthe girl knows what she's doing,
p524
aa(lp525
Vthe girl means something,
p526
aVthe girl means to mean,
p527
aa(lp528
Vbecause it occurs to her in that instant,
p529
aVthat beautiful or not, bright yes or no,
p530
aVshe's not who she is,
p531
aa(lp532
Vshe's not the person she is,
p533
aa(lp534
Vand the reason, she suddenly knows,
p535
aVis that there's been so much premeditation
p536
aa(lp537
Vwhere she is, so much plotting and planning,
p538
aa(lp539
Vthere's hardly a person where she is,
p540
aVor if there is, it's not her, or not wholly her,
p541
aa(lp542
Vit's a self inhabited, lived in by her,
p543
aa(lp544
Vand seemingly even as she thinks it
p545
aVshe knows what's been missing:
p546
aa(lp547
Vgrace,
p548
aa(lp549
Vnot premeditation but grace,
p550
aVa kind of being in the world spontaneously,
p551
aVwith grace.
p552
aa(lp553
VWeightfully upon me was the world.
p554
aa(lp555
VWeightfully this self which graced the world
p556
aVyet never wholly itself.
p557
aa(lp558
VWeightfully this self which weighed upon me,
p559
aVthe release from which is what I desire
p560
aVand what I achieve.
p561
aa(lp562
VAnd the girl remembers, in this infinite instant
p563
aValready now so many times divided,
p564
aa(lp565
Vthe sadness she felt once,
p566
aVhardly knowing she felt it,
p567
aa(lp568
Vto merely inhabit herself.
p569
aa(lp570
VYes, the girl falls, absurd to fall,
p571
aa(lp572
Veven the earth with its compulsion
p573
aVto take unto itself all that falls
p574
aVmust know that falling is absurd,
p575
aa(lp576
Vyet the girl falling isn't myself,
p577
aVor she is myself,
p578
aVbut a self I took of my own volition unto myself.
p579
aVForever. With grace.
p580
aa(lp581

VI'll read just one more. I don't usually say that.
p586
aVI like to just end.
p587
aVBut I'm afraid that Ricky will come out here
p588
aVand shake his fist at me.
p589
aa(lp590
VThis is called "Old Man," appropriately enough.
p591
aa(lp592

p593
aa(lp594

p595
aVon our neighborhood newsstand.
p596
aa(lp597
VBut forget her breasts.
p598
aa(lp599
VA lush, fresh-lipped blond,
p600
aVskin glowing gold, sprawls there,
p601
aVresplendent.
p602
aa(lp603
V60 nearly, yet these hardly tangible,
p604
aVhardly better than harlots, can still stir me.
p605
aa(lp606
VMaybe a coming of age in the
p607
aVAmerican sensual darkness,
p608
aa(lp609
Vnever seeing an unsmudged nipple,
p610
aVan uncensored vagina,
p611
aa(lp612
Vhas left me forever infected
p613
aVwith an unquenchable lust of the eye.
p614
aa(lp615
VAlways that erotic murmur,
p616
aa(lp617
VI'm hardly myself
p618
aVif I'm not in a state of incipient desire.
p619
aa(lp620
VGod knows though,
p621
aVthere are worse twists your obsessions can take.
p622
aa(lp623
VLast year in Israel, a young ultra-orthodox Rabbi
p624
aVguiding some teenage girls through the Shrine of the Shoah
p625
aa(lp626
Vforbade them to look in one room.
p627
aVBecause there were images in it he said were licentious.
p628
aa(lp629
VThe display was a photo. Men and women stripped naked,
p630
aa(lp631
Vsome trying to cover their genitals,
p632
aVothers too frightened to bother,
p633
aa(lp634
Vlined up in snow
p635
aVwaiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch.
p636
aa(lp637
VThe girls, to my horror,
p638
aVaverted their gaze.
p639
aa(lp640
VWhat carnal mistrust had their teacher taught them.
p641
aa(lp642
VEven that though. Another confession:
p643
aa(lp644
VOnce in a book on pre-war Poland,
p645
aa(lp646
Va studio portrait, an absolute angel,
p647
aVan absolute angel with tormented, tormenting eyes.
p648
aa(lp649
VI kept finding myself at her page.
p650
aa(lp651
VThat she died in the camps made her \u2014
p652
aVI didn't dare wonder why \u2014
p653
aa(lp654
Vmore present, more precious.
p655
aa(lp656
VDied in the camps, that too people \u2014
p657
aVor Jews anyway \u2014
p658
aVkept from their children back then.
p659
aa(lp660
VBut it was like sex, you didn't have to be told.
p661
aa(lp662
VSex and death, how close they can seem.
p663
aa(lp664
VSo constantly conscious now of death moving towards me,
p665
aVsometimes I think I confound them.
p666
aa(lp667
VMy wife's loveliness almost consumes me.
p668
aa(lp669
VMy passion for her goes beyond reasonable bounds.
p670
aa(lp671
VWhen we make love, her holding me
p672
aVeverywhere all around me,
p673
aVI'm there and not there.
p674
aa(lp675
VMy mind teems, jumbles of faces, voices, impressions,
p676
aa(lp677
VI live my life over, as though I were drowning.
p678
aa(lp679
VThen I am drowning, in despair
p680
aVat having to leave her,
p681
aVthis, everything, all,
p682
aVunbearable, awful.
p683
aa(lp684
VStill, to be able to die
p685
aVwith no special contrition,
p686
aVnot having been slaughtered, or enslaved.
p687
aa(lp688
VAnd not having to know history's next
p689
aVmad rage or regression,
p690
aVit might be a relief.
p691
aa(lp692
VNo. Again, no.
p693
aVI don't mean that for a moment.
p694
aa(lp695
VWhat I mean is the world holds me so tightly \u2014
p696
aVthe good and the bad \u2014
p697
aa(lp698
Vmy own follies and weakness
p699
aVthat even this counterfeit Venus
p700
aa(lp701
Vwith her sham heat, and her bosom probably plumped
p702
aVwith gel, so moves me
p703
aa(lp704
Vmy breath catches.
p705
aVVamp. Siren. Seductress.
p706
aa(lp707
VHow much more she reveals
p708
aVin her glare of ink than she knows.
p709
aa(lp710
VHow she incarnates
p711
aVour desperate human need for regard,
p712
aa(lp713
Vour passion to live in beauty,
p714
aVto be beauty, to be cherished by glances,
p715
aa(lp716

Williams started writing poetry at 19, after taking only his required English classes at University of Pennsylvania. In the 1960s, he began gearing his poems toward social issues, such as the brutality that&nbsp; civil rights activists often faced and his anti-war stance with respect to Vietnam. Over time, although he continued to write about society, his work became more personal. His focus shifted to the intersection of profoundly different lives in crowded urban spaces, using these instances to examine sensitive issues such as race and class.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />The subject matter of his work is not its only controversy, and Williams is often compared to Whitman and Ginsberg because of his unusually long lines of verse. Despite his unconventional poetic form, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award, among other honors. He also published five works of translation and a psychologically introspective memoir, <a href=\\"http://us.macmillan.com/misgivings\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Misgivings: My Mother, My Father, Myself</em></a>.

Williams started writing poetry at 19, after taking only his required English classes at University of Pennsylvania. In the 1960s, he began gearing his poems toward social issues, such as the brutality that&nbsp; civil rights activists often faced and his anti-war stance with respect to Vietnam. Over time, although he continued to write about society, his work became more personal. His focus shifted to the intersection of profoundly different lives in crowded urban spaces, using these instances to examine sensitive issues such as race and class.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />The subject matter of his work is not its only controversy, and Williams is often compared to Whitman and Ginsberg because of his unusually long lines of verse. Despite his unconventional poetic form, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award, among other honors. He also published five works of translation and a psychologically introspective memoir, <a href=\\"http://us.macmillan.com/misgivings\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><em>Misgivings: My Mother, My Father, Myself</em></a>.

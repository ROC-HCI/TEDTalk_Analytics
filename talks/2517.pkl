VI'm driven by pure passion
p5
aVto create photographs that tell stories.
p6
aVPhotography can be described as the recording of a single moment
p7
aVfrozen within a fraction of time.
p8
aVEach moment or photograph represents a tangible piece
p9
aVof our memories as time passes.
p10
aVBut what if you could capture more than one moment in a photograph?
p11
aVWhat if a photograph could actually collapse time,
p12
aVcompressing the best moments of the day and the night
p13
aVseamlessly into one single image?
p14
aa(lp15
VI've created a concept called "Day to Night"
p16
aVand I believe it's going to change
p17
aVthe way you look at the world.
p18
aVI know it has for me.
p19
aa(lp20
VMy process begins by photographing iconic locations,
p21
aVplaces that are part of what I call our collective memory.
p22
aVI photograph from a fixed vantage point, and I never move.
p23
aVI capture the fleeting moments of humanity and light as time passes.
p24
aVPhotographing for anywhere from 15 to 30 hours
p25
aVand shooting over 1,500 images,
p26
aVI then choose the best moments of the day and night.
p27
aa(lp28
VUsing time as a guide,
p29
aVI seamlessly blend those best moments into one single photograph,
p30
aVvisualizing our conscious journey with time.
p31
aVI can take you to Paris
p32
aVfor a view from the Tournelle Bridge.
p33
aVAnd I can show you the early morning rowers
p34
aValong the River Seine.
p35
aVAnd simultaneously,
p36
aVI can show you Notre Dame aglow at night.
p37
aVAnd in between, I can show you the romance of the City of Light.
p38
aa(lp39
VI am essentially a street photographer from 50 feet in the air,
p40
aVand every single thing you see in this photograph
p41
aVactually happened on this day.
p42
aa(lp43
VDay to Night is a global project,
p44
aVand my work has always been about history.
p45
aVI'm fascinated by the concept of going to a place like Venice
p46
aVand actually seeing it during a specific event.
p47
aVAnd I decided I wanted to see the historical Regata,
p48
aVan event that's actually been taking place since 1498.
p49
aVThe boats and the costumes look exactly as they did then.
p50
aVAnd an important element that I really want you guys to understand is:
p51
aVthis is not a timelapse,
p52
aVthis is me photographing throughout the day and the night.
p53
aVI am a relentless collector of magical moments.
p54
aVAnd the thing that drives me is the fear of just missing one of them.
p55
aa(lp56
VThe entire concept came about in 1996.
p57
aVLIFE Magazine commissioned me to create a panoramic photograph
p58
aVof the cast and crew of Baz Luhrmann's film Romeo + Juliet.
p59
aVI got to the set and realized: it's a square.
p60
aVSo the only way I could actually create a panoramic was to shoot a collage
p61
aVof 250 single images.
p62
aVSo I had DiCaprio and Claire Danes embracing.
p63
aVAnd as I pan my camera to the right,
p64
aVI noticed there was a mirror on the wall
p65
aVand I saw they were actually reflecting in it.
p66
aVAnd for that one moment, that one image
p67
aVI asked them, "Would you guys just kiss
p68
aVfor this one picture?"
p69
aVAnd then I came back to my studio in New York,
p70
aVand I hand-glued these 250 images together
p71
aVand stood back and went, "Wow, this is so cool!
p72
aVI'm changing time in a photograph."
p73
aVAnd that concept actually stayed with me for 13 years
p74
aVuntil technology finally has caught up to my dreams.
p75
aa(lp76
VThis is an image I created of the Santa Monica Pier, Day to Night.
p77
aVAnd I'm going to show you a little video
p78
aVthat gives you an idea of what it's like being with me
p79
aVwhen I do these pictures.
p80
aVTo start with, you have to understand that to get views like this,
p81
aVmost of my time is spent up high, and I'm usually in a cherry picker
p82
aVor a crane.
p83
aVSo this is a typical day, 12-18 hours, non-stop
p84
aVcapturing the entire day unfold.
p85
aa(lp86
VOne of the things that's great is I love to people-watch.
p87
aVAnd trust me when I tell you,
p88
aVthis is the greatest seat in the house to have.
p89
aa(lp90
VBut this is really how I go about creating these photographs.
p91
aVSo once I decide on my view and the location,
p92
aVI have to decide where day begins and night ends.
p93
aVAnd that's what I call the time vector.
p94
aVEinstein described time as a fabric.
p95
aVThink of the surface of a trampoline:
p96
aVit warps and stretches with gravity.
p97
aVI see time as a fabric as well,
p98
aVexcept I take that fabric and flatten it, compress it into single plane.
p99
aa(lp100
VOne of the unique aspects of this work is also,
p101
aVif you look at all my pictures,
p102
aVthe time vector changes:
p103
aVsometimes I'll go left to right,
p104
aVsometimes front to back, up or down, even diagonally.
p105
aVI am exploring the space-time continuum
p106
aVwithin a two-dimensional still photograph.
p107
aa(lp108
VNow when I do these pictures,
p109
aVit's literally like a real-time puzzle going on in my mind.
p110
aVI build a photograph based on time,
p111
aVand this is what I call the master plate.
p112
aVThis can take us several months to complete.
p113
aVThe fun thing about this work is
p114
aVI have absolutely zero control when I get up there
p115
aVon any given day and capture photographs.
p116
aVSo I never know who's going to be in the picture,
p117
aVif it's going to be a great sunrise or sunset \u2014 no control.
p118
aVIt's at the end of the process,
p119
aVif I've had a really great day and everything remained the same,
p120
aVthat I then decide who's in and who's out,
p121
aVand it's all based on time.
p122
aVI'll take those best moments that I pick over a month of editing
p123
aVand they get seamlessly blended into the master plate.
p124
aVI'm compressing the day and night
p125
aVas I saw it,
p126
aVcreating a unique harmony between these two very discordant worlds.
p127
aa(lp128
VPainting has always been a really important influence in all my work
p129
aVand I've always been a huge fan of Albert Bierstadt,
p130
aVthe great Hudson River School painter.
p131
aVHe inspired a recent series that I did on the National Parks.
p132
aVThis is Bierstadt's Yosemite Valley.
p133
aVSo this is the photograph I created of Yosemite.
p134
aVThis is actually the cover story of the 2016 January issue
p135
aVof National Geographic.
p136
aVI photographed for over 30 hours in this picture.
p137
aVI was literally on the side of a cliff,
p138
aVcapturing the stars and the moonlight as it transitions,
p139
aVthe moonlight lighting El Capitan.
p140
aVAnd I also captured this transition of time throughout the landscape.
p141
aVThe best part is obviously seeing the magical moments of humanity
p142
aVas time changed \u2014
p143
aVfrom day into night.
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd on a personal note,
p146
aVI actually had a photocopy of Bierstadt's painting in my pocket.
p147
aVAnd when that sun started to rise in the valley,
p148
aVI started to literally shake with excitement
p149
aVbecause I looked at the painting and I go,
p150
aV"Oh my god, I'm getting Bierstadt's exact same lighting
p151
aV100 years earlier."
p152
aa(lp153
VDay to Night is about all the things,
p154
aVit's like a compilation of all the things I love
p155
aVabout the medium of photography.
p156
aVIt's about landscape,
p157
aVit's about street photography,
p158
aVit's about color, it's about architecture,
p159
aVperspective, scale \u2014 and, especially, history.
p160
aa(lp161
VThis is one of the most historical moments
p162
aVI've been able to photograph,
p163
aVthe 2013 Presidential Inauguration of Barack Obama.
p164
aVAnd if you look closely in this picture,
p165
aVyou can actually see time changing
p166
aVin those large television sets.
p167
aVYou can see Michelle waiting with the children,
p168
aVthe president now greets the crowd,
p169
aVhe takes his oath,
p170
aVand now he's speaking to the people.
p171
aVThere's so many challenging aspects when I create photographs like this.
p172
aVFor this particular photograph,
p173
aVI was in a 50-foot scissor lift up in the air
p174
aVand it was not very stable.
p175
aVSo every time my assistant and I shifted our weight,
p176
aVour horizon line shifted.
p177
aVSo for every picture you see,
p178
aVand there were about 1,800 in this picture,
p179
aVwe both had to tape our feet into position
p180
aVevery time I clicked the shutter.
p181
aV(Applause)
p182
aa(lp183
VI've learned so many extraordinary things doing this work.
p184
aVI think the two most important are patience
p185
aVand the power of observation.
p186
aVWhen you photograph a city like New York from above,
p187
aVI discovered that those people in cars
p188
aVthat I sort of live with everyday,
p189
aVthey don't look like people in cars anymore.
p190
aVThey feel like a giant school of fish,
p191
aVit was a form of emergent behavior.
p192
aVAnd when people describe the energy of New York,
p193
aVI think this photograph begins to really capture that.
p194
aVWhen you look closer in my work,
p195
aVyou can see there's stories going on.
p196
aVYou realize that Times Square is a canyon,
p197
aVit's shadow and it's sunlight.
p198
aVSo I decided, in this photograph, I would checkerboard time.
p199
aVSo wherever the shadows are, it's night
p200
aVand wherever the sun is, it's actually day.
p201
aa(lp202
VTime is this extraordinary thing
p203
aVthat we never can really wrap our heads around.
p204
aVBut in a very unique and special way,
p205
aVI believe these photographs begin to put a face on time.
p206
aVThey embody a new metaphysical visual reality.
p207
aVWhen you spend 15 hours looking at a place,
p208
aVyou're going to see things a little differently
p209
aVthan if you or I walked up with our camera,
p210
aVtook a picture, and then walked away.
p211
aa(lp212
VThis was a perfect example.
p213
aVI call it "Sacré-Coeur Selfie."
p214
aVI watched over 15 hours
p215
aVall these people not even look at Sacré-Coeur.
p216
aVThey were more interested in using it as a backdrop.
p217
aVThey would walk up, take a picture,
p218
aVand then walk away.
p219
aVAnd I found this to be an absolutely extraordinary example,
p220
aVa powerful disconnect between what we think the human experience is
p221
aVversus what the human experience is evolving into.
p222
aVThe act of sharing has suddenly become more important
p223
aVthan the experience itself.
p224
aV(Applause)
p225
aa(lp226
VAnd finally, my most recent image,
p227
aVwhich has such a special meaning for me personally:
p228
aVthis is the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania.
p229
aVAnd this is photographed in the middle of the Seronera,
p230
aVthis is not a reserve.
p231
aVI went specifically during the peak migration
p232
aVto hopefully capture the most diverse range of animals.
p233
aVUnfortunately, when we got there,
p234
aVthere was a drought going on during the peak migration,
p235
aVa five-week drought.
p236
aVSo all the animals were drawn to the water.
p237
aVI found this one watering hole,
p238
aVand felt if everything remained the same way it was behaving,
p239
aVI had a real opportunity to capture something unique.
p240
aa(lp241
VWe spent three days studying it,
p242
aVand nothing could have prepared me
p243
aVfor what I witnessed during our shoot day.
p244
aVI photographed for 26 hours
p245
aVin a sealed crocodile blind, 18 feet in the air.
p246
aVWhat I witnessed was unimaginable.
p247
aVFrankly, it was Biblical.
p248
aVWe saw, for 26 hours,
p249
aVall these competitive species share a single resource called water.
p250
aVThe same resource that humanity is supposed to have wars over
p251
aVduring the next 50 years.
p252
aVThe animals never even grunted at each other.
p253
aVThey seem to understand something that we humans don't.
p254
aVThat this precious resource called water
p255
aVis something we all have to share.
p256
aa(lp257
VWhen I created this picture,
p258
aVI realized that Day to Night is really a new way of seeing,
p259
aVcompressing time,
p260
aVexploring the space-time continuum within a photograph.
p261
aa(lp262
VAs technology evolves along with photography,
p263
aVphotographs will not only communicate a deeper meaning of time and memory,
p264
aVbut they will compose a new narrative of untold stories,
p265
aVcreating a timeless window into our world.
p266
aa(lp267
VThank you.
p268
aa(lp269
V(Applause)

class=\\"s1\\">Since opening his studio in New York City in 1983, photographer Stephen Wilkes has built an unprecedented body of work and a reputation as one of America&#39;s most iconic photographers, widely recognized for his fine art, editorial and commercial work.</span></p><p class=\\"p1\\">His photographs are included in the collections of the George Eastman Museum, James A. Michener Art Museum, Houston Museum of Fine Arts, Dow Jones Collection, Griffin Museum of Photography, Jewish Museum of NY, Library of Congress, Snite Museum of Art, The Historic New Orleans Collection, Museum of the City of New York, 9/11 Memorial Museum and numerous private collections. His editorial work has appeared in, and on the covers of, leading publications such as the <em>New York Times Magazine</em>, <em>Vanity Fair</em>, <em>TIME</em>, <em>Fortune</em>, <em>National Geographic</em>, <em>Sports Illustrated</em>&nbsp;and many others.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">In 1998, a one-day assignment to the south side of Ellis Island led to a 5-year photographic study of the island&#39;s long abandoned medical wards where immigrants were detained before they could enter America. Through his photographs and video, Wilkes helped secure $6 million toward the restoration of the south side of the island.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">Day to Night, Wilkes&#39; most defining project, began in 2009. These epic cityscapes and landscapes, portrayed from a fixed camera angle for up to 30 hours capture fleeting moments of humanity as light passes in front of his lens over the course of full day. Blending these images into a single photograph takes months to complete. Day to Night has been featured on CBS Sunday Morning as well as dozens of other prominent media outlets and, with a grant from the National Geographic Society, was recently extended to include America&#39;s National Parks in celebration of their centennial anniversary. The series will be published by TASCHEN as a monograph in 2017.</p><p class=\\"p1\\">Wilkes, who lives and maintains his studio in Westport, CT, is represented by Bryce Wolkowitz Gallery, New York; Peter Fetterman Gallery, Los Angeles; Monroe Gallery of Photography, Santa Fe; and ARTITLEDContemporary, The Netherlands.</p>", "slug": "stephen_wilkes", "whotheyare": "By blending up to 100 still photographs into a seamless composite that captures the transition from day to night, Stephen Wilkes reveals the stories hidden in familiar locations.", "whatotherssay": "The very idea of a photograph is that it captures a single moment. One click of the shutter renders the briefest sliver of time permanent. Everything before and everything after might as well not have happened at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nStephen Wilkes is not about that single moment, not exactly. He is, rather, a collector of moments, staking out a location until he has hoovered up enough of them to tell the story of a single place. The reality is altogether more ordinary and yet somehow more striking: day and night -- together. These are not the briefest of moments. They are many moments, as many as possible, collapsed and fused into one.", "id": 2858, "photo_url": "https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/9c321a6199de0dd46423118fc6f22d322eb7ac1d_254x191.jpg"}], "title": "The passing of time, caught in a single photo", "take_action": [], "comments": 27135, "more_resources": [{"status": "approved", "start_at": null, "headline": "Day to night: TASCHEN Books", "link_url": "https://www.taschen.com/pages/en/company/blog/766.day_to_night.htm", "eyebrow": null, "end_at": null, "image_url": "", "published": true, "visible_url": "taschen.com", "type": "external_website", "blurb": "Learn more about an upcoming book from Stephen Wilkes."}, {"status": "approved", "start_at": null, "headline": "\\"Who Shot Sports: A Photographic History, 1843 to the Present\\" at the Brooklyn Museum", "link_url": "http://www.stephenwilkes.com/news/brooklyn-museum", "eyebrow": null, "end_at": null, "image_url": "", "published": true, "visible_url": "stephenwilkes.com", "type": "external_website", "blurb": "Wrigley Field, Day to Night, Chicago has been selected to appear at the Brooklyn Museum in \\"Who Shot Sports: A Photographic History, 1843 to the Present\\", an exhibit curated by distinguished photographic historian Gail Buckland.

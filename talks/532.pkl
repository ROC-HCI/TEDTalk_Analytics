VWe look around the media, as we see on the news from Iraq,
p5
aVAfghanistan, Sierra Leone,
p6
aVand the conflict seems incomprehensible to us.
p7
aVAnd that's certainly how it seemed to me when I started this project.
p8
aVBut as a physicist,
p9
aVI thought, well if you give me some data,
p10
aVI could maybe understand this. You know, give us a go.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo as a naive New Zealander
p13
aVI thought, well I'll go to the Pentagon.
p14
aVCan you get me some information?
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aVNo. So I had to think a little harder.
p17
aVAnd I was watching the news one night in Oxford.
p18
aVAnd I looked down at the chattering heads on my channel of choice.
p19
aVAnd I saw that there was information there.
p20
aVThere was data within the streams of news that we consume.
p21
aVAll this noise around us actually has information.
p22
aVSo what I started thinking was,
p23
aVperhaps there is something like open source intelligence here.
p24
aVIf we can get enough of these streams of information together,
p25
aVwe can perhaps start to understand the war.
p26
aa(lp27
VSo this is exactly what I did. We started bringing a team together,
p28
aVan interdisciplinary team of scientists,
p29
aVof economists, mathematicians.
p30
aVWe brought these guys together and we started to try and solve this.
p31
aVWe did it in three steps.
p32
aVThe first step we did was to collect. We did 130 different sources of information \u2014
p33
aVfrom NGO reports to newspapers and cable news.
p34
aVWe brought this raw data in and we filtered it.
p35
aVWe extracted the key bits on information to build the database.
p36
aVThat database contained
p37
aVthe timing of attacks,
p38
aVthe location, the size and the weapons used.
p39
aVIt's all in the streams of information we consume daily,
p40
aVwe just have to know how to pull it out.
p41
aVAnd once we had this we could start doing some cool stuff.
p42
aVWhat if we were to look at the distribution of the sizes of attacks?
p43
aVWhat would that tell us?
p44
aa(lp45
VSo we started doing this. And you can see here
p46
aVon the horizontal axis
p47
aVyou've got the number of people killed in an attack
p48
aVor the size of the attack.
p49
aVAnd on the vertical axis you've got the number of attacks.
p50
aVSo we plot data for sample on this.
p51
aVYou see some sort of random distribution \u2014
p52
aVperhaps 67 attacks, one person was killed,
p53
aVor 47 attacks where seven people were killed.
p54
aVWe did this exact same thing for Iraq.
p55
aVAnd we didn't know, for Iraq what we were going to find.
p56
aVIt turns out what we found was pretty surprising.
p57
aVYou take all of the conflict,
p58
aVall of the chaos, all of the noise,
p59
aVand out of that
p60
aVcomes this precise mathematical distribution
p61
aVof the way attacks are ordered in this conflict.
p62
aVThis blew our mind.
p63
aVWhy should a conflict like Iraq have this
p64
aVas its fundamental signature?
p65
aVWhy should there be order in war?
p66
aVWe didn't really understand that.
p67
aVWe thought maybe there is something special about Iraq.
p68
aVSo we looked at a few more conflicts.
p69
aVWe looked at Colombia, we looked at Afghanistan,
p70
aVand we looked at Senegal.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd the same pattern emerged in each conflict.
p73
aVThis wasn't supposed to happen.
p74
aVThese are different wars, with different religious factions,
p75
aVdifferent political factions, and different socioeconomic problems.
p76
aVAnd yet the fundamental patterns underlying them
p77
aVare the same.
p78
aVSo we went a little wider.
p79
aVWe looked around the world at all the data we could get our hands on.
p80
aVFrom Peru to Indonesia,
p81
aVwe studied this same pattern again.
p82
aVAnd we found that not only
p83
aVwere the distributions these straight lines,
p84
aVbut the slope of these lines, they clustered around
p85
aVthis value of alpha equals 2.5.
p86
aVAnd we could generate an equation
p87
aVthat could predict the likelihood of an attack.
p88
aVWhat we're saying here
p89
aVis the probability of an attack killing X number of people
p90
aVin a country like Iraq
p91
aVis equal to a constant, times the size of that attack,
p92
aVraised to the power of negative alpha.
p93
aVAnd negative alpha is the slope of that line I showed you before.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo what?
p96
aVThis is data, statistics. What does it tell us about these conflicts?
p97
aVThat was a challenge we had to face as physicists.
p98
aVHow do we explain this?
p99
aVAnd what we really found was that alpha,
p100
aVif we think about it, is the organizational
p101
aVstructure of the insurgency.
p102
aVAlpha is the distribution of the sizes of attacks,
p103
aVwhich is really the distribution
p104
aVof the group strength carrying out the attacks.
p105
aVSo we look at a process of group dynamics:
p106
aVcoalescence and fragmentation,
p107
aVgroups coming together, groups breaking apart.
p108
aVAnd we start running the numbers on this. Can we simulate it?
p109
aVCan we create the kind of patterns that we're seeing
p110
aVin places like Iraq?
p111
aVTurns out we kind of do a reasonable job.
p112
aVWe can run these simulations.
p113
aVWe can recreate this using a process of group dynamics
p114
aVto explain the patterns that we see
p115
aVall around the conflicts around the world.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo what's going on?
p118
aVWhy should these different \u2014 seemingly different conflicts
p119
aVhave the same patterns?
p120
aVNow what I believe is going on is that
p121
aVthe insurgent forces, they evolve over time. They adapt.
p122
aVAnd it turns out there is only one solution
p123
aVto fight a much stronger enemy.
p124
aVAnd if you don't find that solution as an insurgent force,
p125
aVyou don't exist.
p126
aVSo every insurgent force that is ongoing,
p127
aVevery conflict that is ongoing,
p128
aVit's going to look something like this.
p129
aVAnd that is what we think is happening.
p130
aa(lp131
VTaking it forward, how do we change it?
p132
aVHow do we end a war like Iraq?
p133
aVWhat does it look like?
p134
aVAlpha is the structure. It's got a stable state at 2.5.
p135
aVThis is what wars look like when they continue.
p136
aVWe've got to change that.
p137
aVWe can push it up:
p138
aVthe forces become more fragmented;
p139
aVthere is more of them, but they are weaker.
p140
aVOr we push it down:
p141
aVthey're more robust; there is less groups;
p142
aVbut perhaps you can sit and talk to them.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo this graph here, I'm going to show you now.
p145
aVNo one has seen this before. This is literally
p146
aVstuff that we've come through last week.
p147
aVAnd we see the evolution of Alpha through time.
p148
aVWe see it start. And we see it grow up to the stable state
p149
aVthe wars around the world look like.
p150
aVAnd it stays there through the invasion of Fallujah
p151
aVuntil the Samarra bombings in the
p152
aVIraqi elections of '06.
p153
aVAnd the system gets perturbed. It moves upwards
p154
aVto a fragmented state.
p155
aVThis is when the surge happens.
p156
aVAnd depending on who you ask,
p157
aVthe surge was supposed to push it up even further.
p158
aVThe opposite happened.
p159
aVThe groups became stronger.
p160
aVThey became more robust.
p161
aVAnd so I'm thinking, right, great, it's going to keep going down.
p162
aVWe can talk to them. We can get a solution. The opposite happened.
p163
aVIt's moved up again. The groups are more fragmented.
p164
aVAnd this tells me one of two things.
p165
aVEither we're back where we started
p166
aVand the surge has had no effect;
p167
aVor finally the groups have been fragmented to the extent
p168
aVthat we can start to think about maybe moving out.
p169
aVI don't know what the answer is to that.
p170
aVBut I know that we should be looking at the structure of the insurgency
p171
aVto answer that question.
p172
aVThank you.

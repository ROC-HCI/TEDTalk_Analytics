VMy students often ask me, "What is sociology?"
p5
aVAnd I tell them it's the study of the way in which human beings are shaped
p6
aVby things that they don't see.
p7
aVAnd they say, "So, how can I be a sociologist?
p8
aVHow can I understand those invisible forces?"
p9
aVAnd I say, "Empathy.
p10
aVStart with empathy.
p11
aVIt all begins with empathy.
p12
aVTake yourself out of your shoes,
p13
aVput yourself into the shoes of another person."
p14
aa(lp15
VHere, I'll give you an example.
p16
aVSo I imagine my life if, a hundred years ago,
p17
aVChina had been the most powerful nation in the world
p18
aVand they came to the United States in search of coal.
p19
aVAnd they found it, and, in fact, they found lots of it right here.
p20
aVAnd pretty soon, they began shipping that coal,
p21
aVton by ton,
p22
aVrailcar by railcar, boatload by boatload,
p23
aVback to China and elsewhere around the world.
p24
aVAnd they got fabulously wealthy in doing so.
p25
aVAnd they built beautiful cities
p26
aVall powered on that coal.
p27
aVAnd back here in the United States,
p28
aVwe saw economic despair, deprivation.
p29
aVThis is what I saw.
p30
aVI saw people struggling to get by,
p31
aVnot knowing what was what and what was next.
p32
aVAnd I asked myself the question:
p33
aVHow is it possible that we could be so poor here in the United States,
p34
aVbecause coal is such a wealthy resource; it's so much money?
p35
aVAnd I realize:
p36
aVbecause the Chinese ingratiated themselves
p37
aVwith a small ruling class here in the United States,
p38
aVwho stole all of that money and all of that wealth for themselves.
p39
aVAnd the rest of us, the vast majority of us,
p40
aVstruggle to get by.
p41
aVAnd the Chinese gave this small ruling elite
p42
aVloads of military weapons and sophisticated technology
p43
aVin order to ensure that people like me
p44
aVwould not speak out against this relationship.
p45
aVDoes this sound familiar?
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd they did things like train Americans to help protect the coal.
p48
aVAnd everywhere, there were symbols of the Chinese \u2014
p49
aVeverywhere, a constant reminder.
p50
aVAnd back in China,
p51
aVwhat do they say in China?
p52
aVNothing! They don't talk about us. They don't talk about the coal.
p53
aVIf you ask them,
p54
aVthey'll say, "Well, you know, we need the coal.
p55
aVI mean, come on, I'm not going to turn down my thermostat.
p56
aVYou can't expect that."
p57
aVAnd so, I get angry, and I get pissed,
p58
aVas do lots of average people.
p59
aVAnd we fight back, and it gets really ugly.
p60
aVAnd the Chinese respond in a very ugly way.
p61
aVAnd before we know it, they send in the tanks
p62
aVand they send in the troops.
p63
aVAnd lots of people are dying.
p64
aVAnd it's a very, very difficult situation.
p65
aa(lp66
VCan you imagine what you would feel
p67
aVif you were in my shoes?
p68
aVCan you imagine walking out of this building
p69
aVand seeing a tank sitting out there,
p70
aVor a truck full of soldiers?
p71
aVJust imagine what you would feel, because you know why they're here;
p72
aVyou know what they're doing here.
p73
aVAnd you just feel the anger and you feel the fear.
p74
aVIf you can, that's empathy. That's empathy.
p75
aVYou've left your shoes, and you've stood in mine.
p76
aVAnd you've got to feel that.
p77
aa(lp78
VOK, so that's the warm-up.
p79
aVThat's the warm-up.
p80
aVNow we're going to have the real radical experiment.
p81
aVSo, for the remainder of my talk, what I want you to do
p82
aVis put yourselves in the shoes of an ordinary Arab Muslim
p83
aVliving in the Middle East \u2014
p84
aVin particular, in Iraq.
p85
aVAnd so to help you,
p86
aVperhaps you're a member of this middle-class family in Baghdad.
p87
aVWhat you want is the best for your kids.
p88
aVYou want your kids to have a better life.
p89
aVAnd you watch the news, you pay attention.
p90
aVYou read the newspaper, you go down to the coffee shop with your friends,
p91
aVyou read the newspapers from around the world.
p92
aVSometimes you even watch satellite, CNN, from the United States.
p93
aVYou have a sense of what the Americans are thinking.
p94
aVBut really, you just want a better life for yourself.
p95
aVThat's what you want.
p96
aVYou're Arab Muslim living in Iraq.
p97
aVYou want a better life for yourself.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo here, let me help you.
p100
aVLet me help you with some things that you might be thinking.
p101
aVNumber one:
p102
aVthis incursion into your land these past 20 years and before \u2014
p103
aVthe reason anyone is interested in your land,
p104
aVand particularly the United States, is oil.
p105
aVIt's all about oil; you know that, everybody knows that.
p106
aVPeople back in the United States know it's about oil.
p107
aVIt's because somebody else has a design for your resource.
p108
aVIt's your resource \u2014 it's not somebody else's.
p109
aVIt's your land; it's your resource.
p110
aVSomebody else has a design for it.
p111
aVAnd you know why they have a design?
p112
aVYou know why they have their eyes set on it?
p113
aVBecause they have an entire economic system
p114
aVthat's dependent on that oil \u2014 foreign oil,
p115
aVoil from other parts of the world that they don't own.
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd what else do you think about these people?
p118
aVThe Americans, they're rich.
p119
aVCome on, they live in big houses, they have big cars.
p120
aVThey all have blond hair, blue eyes. They're happy.
p121
aVYou think that. It's not true, of course, but that's the media impression.
p122
aVAnd that's what you get.
p123
aVAnd they have big cities,
p124
aVand the cities are all dependent on oil.
p125
aVAnd back home, what do you see?
p126
aVPoverty, despair, struggle.
p127
aVLook, you don't live in a wealthy country.
p128
aVI mean \u2014 this is Iraq.
p129
aVThis is what you see.
p130
aVYou see people struggling to get by.
p131
aVIt's not easy; you see a lot of poverty.
p132
aVAnd you feel something about this.
p133
aVThese people have designs for your resource,
p134
aVand this is what you see?
p135
aa(lp136
VSomething else you see that you talk about \u2014
p137
aVAmericans don't talk about this, but you do \u2014
p138
aVthere's this thing, this militarization of the world,
p139
aVand it's centered right in the United States.
p140
aVAnd the United States is responsible
p141
aVfor almost one half of the world's military spending.
p142
aVFour percent of the world's population!
p143
aVAnd you feel it; you see it every day.
p144
aVIt's part of your life.
p145
aVAnd you talk about it with your friends.
p146
aVYou read about it.
p147
aVAnd back when Saddam Hussein was in power,
p148
aVthe Americans didn't care about his crimes.
p149
aVWhen he was gassing the Kurds and gassing Iran,
p150
aVthey didn't care about it.
p151
aVWhen oil was at stake,
p152
aVsomehow, suddenly, things mattered.
p153
aVAnd what you see, something else:
p154
aVthe United States,
p155
aVthe hub of democracy around the world \u2014
p156
aVthey don't seem to really be supporting democratic countries
p157
aVall around the world.
p158
aVThere are a lot of countries, oil-producing countries,
p159
aVthat aren't very democratic, but supported by the United States.
p160
aVThat's odd.
p161
aa(lp162
VOh \u2014 these incursions, these two wars,
p163
aVthe 10 years of sanctions,
p164
aVthe eight years of occupation,
p165
aVthe insurgency that's been unleashed on your people,
p166
aVthe tens of thousands, the hundreds of thousands
p167
aVof civilian deaths?
p168
aVAll because of oil.
p169
aVYou can't help but think that.
p170
aVYou talk about it.
p171
aVIt's in the forefront of your mind, always.
p172
aVYou say, "How is that possible?"
p173
aVAnd this man, he's everyman \u2014
p174
aVyour grandfather, your uncle,
p175
aVyour father, your son, your neighbor,
p176
aVyour professor, your student.
p177
aVOnce a life of happiness and joy
p178
aVand suddenly, pain and sorrow.
p179
aVEveryone in your country has been touched by the violence,
p180
aVthe bloodshed, the pain, the horror \u2014 everybody.
p181
aVNot a single person in your country has not been touched.
p182
aa(lp183
VBut there's something else.
p184
aVThere's something else about these people, these Americans who are there.
p185
aVThere's something else about them that you see
p186
aVthat they don't see themselves.
p187
aVAnd what do you see? They're Christians!
p188
aVThey're Christians.
p189
aVThey worship the Christian God, they have crosses, they carry Bibles.
p190
aVTheir Bibles have a little insignia
p191
aVthat says "US Army" on them.
p192
aVAnd their leaders, their leaders:
p193
aVbefore they send their sons and daughters off to war in your country \u2014
p194
aVand you know the reason \u2014
p195
aVbefore they send them off,
p196
aVthey go to a Christian church, and they pray to their Christian God,
p197
aVand they ask for protection and guidance from that god.
p198
aVWhy?
p199
aVWell, obviously, when people die in the war,
p200
aVthey are Muslims, they are Iraqis \u2014 they're not Americans.
p201
aVYou don't want Americans to die \u2014 "Protect Our Troops."
p202
aVAnd you feel something about that \u2014
p203
aVof course you do.
p204
aVAnd they do wonderful things.
p205
aVYou read about it, you hear about it.
p206
aVThey're there to build schools and help people.
p207
aVThat's what they want to do.
p208
aVThey do wonderful things, but they also do the bad things,
p209
aVand you can't tell the difference.
p210
aa(lp211
VAnd this guy, you get a guy like Lt. Gen. William Boykin.
p212
aVHere's a guy who says that your god is a false god.
p213
aVYour god's an idol; his god is the true god.
p214
aVThe solution to the problem in the Middle East, according to him,
p215
aVis to convert you all to Christianity \u2014
p216
aVjust get rid of your religion.
p217
aVAnd you know that. Americans don't read about this guy.
p218
aVThey don't know anything about him, but you do.
p219
aVYou pass it around. You pass his words around.
p220
aVI mean, this is serious. You're afraid.
p221
aVHe was one of the leading commanders in the second invasion of Iraq.
p222
aVAnd you're thinking, "My God, if this guy is saying that,
p223
aVthen all the soldiers must be saying that."
p224
aVAnd this word here \u2014
p225
aVGeorge Bush called this war a crusade.
p226
aVMan, the Americans, they're just like, "Ah, crusade.
p227
aVWhatever. I don't know what that means."
p228
aVYou know what it means \u2014 it's a holy war against Muslims.
p229
aVLook, invade, subdue them, take their resources.
p230
aVIf they won't submit, kill them.
p231
aVThat's what this is about.
p232
aVAnd you're thinking, "My God, these Christians are coming to kill us."
p233
aVThis is frightening.
p234
aVYou feel frightened. Of course you feel frightened.
p235
aa(lp236
VAnd this man, Terry Jones:
p237
aVI mean here's a guy who wants to burn Qurans, right?
p238
aVAnd the Americans: "Ah, he's a knucklehead.
p239
aVHe's a former hotel manager; he's got three dozen members of his church ..."
p240
aVThey laugh him off.
p241
aVYou don't laugh him off, because in the context of everything else,
p242
aVall the pieces fit.
p243
aVOf course this is how Americans think.
p244
aVSo people all over the Middle East, not just in your country,
p245
aVare protesting.
p246
aV"He wants to burn Qurans, our holy book.
p247
aVThese Christians \u2014 who are these Christians?
p248
aVThey're so evil, they're so mean \u2014 this is what they're about?"
p249
aVThis is what you're thinking as an Arab Muslim,
p250
aVas an Iraqi.
p251
aVOf course you're going to think this.
p252
aa(lp253
VAnd then your cousin says, "Hey coz, check out this website.
p254
aVYou've got to see this \u2014 Bible Boot Camp.
p255
aVThese Christians are nuts!
p256
aVThey're training their little kids to be soldiers for Jesus.
p257
aVThey take little kids and run them through these things
p258
aVtill they teach them how to say, 'Sir! Yes, sir!'
p259
aVand things like 'grenade toss' and 'weapons care and maintenance.'
p260
aVAnd go to the website \u2014 it says 'US Army' right on it.
p261
aVI mean, these Christians, they're nuts.
p262
aVHow can they do this to their little kids?"
p263
aVAnd you're reading this website.
p264
aVAnd of course, Christians in the United States, or anybody,
p265
aVsays, "This is some little church in the middle of nowhere."
p266
aVYou don't know that.
p267
aVFor you, this is like, all Christians.
p268
aVIt's all over the Web: "Bible Boot Camp."
p269
aVAnd look at this.
p270
aVThey even teach their kids \u2014
p271
aVthey train them in the same way the US Marines train.
p272
aVIsn't that interesting.
p273
aVAnd it scares you, and it frightens you.
p274
aa(lp275
VSo these guys, you see them.
p276
aVYou see, I, Sam Richards \u2014 I know who these guys are.
p277
aVThey're my students, my friends; I know what they're thinking.
p278
aVYou don't know.
p279
aVWhen you see them, they're something else.
p280
aVThey're something else.
p281
aVThat's what they are to you.
p282
aVWe don't see it that way in the United States,
p283
aVbut you see it that way.
p284
aVSo here.
p285
aVOf course, you've got it wrong.
p286
aVYou're generalizing. It's wrong.
p287
aVYou don't understand the Americans.
p288
aVIt's not a Christian invasion.
p289
aVWe're not just there for oil; we're there for lots of reasons.
p290
aVYou have it wrong. You've missed it.
p291
aVAnd of course, most of you don't support the insurgency;
p292
aVyou don't support killing Americans;
p293
aVyou don't support the terrorists.
p294
aVOf course you don't. Very few people do.
p295
aVBut \u2014 some of you do.
p296
aVAnd this is a perspective.
p297
aVOK. So now, here's what we're going to do.
p298
aa(lp299
VStep outside of your shoes that you're in right now,
p300
aVand step back into your normal shoes.
p301
aVSo everyone's back in the room. OK?
p302
aVNow here comes the radical experiment.
p303
aVSo we're all back home.
p304
aVThis photo: this woman \u2014
p305
aVman, I feel her.
p306
aVI feel her.
p307
aVShe's my sister,
p308
aVmy wife, my cousin, my neighbor.
p309
aVShe's anybody to me.
p310
aVThese guys standing there, everybody in the photo \u2014
p311
aVI feel this photo, man.
p312
aVSo here's what I want you to do.
p313
aa(lp314
VLet's go back to my first example, of the Chinese.
p315
aVI want you to go there.
p316
aVIt's all about coal, and the Chinese are here in the United States.
p317
aVWhat I want you to do is picture her
p318
aVas a Chinese woman receiving a Chinese flag
p319
aVbecause her loved one has died in America in the coal uprising.
p320
aVAnd the soldiers are Chinese,
p321
aVand everybody else is Chinese.
p322
aVAs an American, how do you feel about this picture?
p323
aVWhat do you think about that scene?
p324
aa(lp325
VOK, try this. Bring it back.
p326
aVThis is the scene here.
p327
aVIt's an American, American soldiers,
p328
aVAmerican woman who lost her loved one in the Middle East,
p329
aVin Iraq or Afghanistan.
p330
aVNow, put yourself in the shoes,
p331
aVgo back to the shoes of an Arab Muslim living in Iraq.
p332
aVWhat are you feeling and thinking about this photo,
p333
aVabout this woman?
p334
aa(lp335
VOK,
p336
aVnow follow me on this,
p337
aVbecause I'm taking a big risk here.
p338
aVAnd so I'm going to invite you to take a risk with me.
p339
aVThese gentlemen here, they're insurgents.
p340
aVThey were caught by the American soldiers, trying to kill Americans.
p341
aVAnd maybe they succeeded. Maybe they succeeded.
p342
aVPut yourself in the shoes of the Americans who caught them.
p343
aVCan you feel the rage?
p344
aVCan you feel that you just want to take these guys
p345
aVand wring their necks?
p346
aVCan you go there?
p347
aVIt shouldn't be that difficult.
p348
aVYou just \u2014 oh, man.
p349
aVNow, put yourself in their shoes.
p350
aVAre they brutal killers
p351
aVor patriotic defenders?
p352
aVWhich one?
p353
aVCan you feel their anger,
p354
aVtheir fear,
p355
aVtheir rage
p356
aVat what has happened in their country?
p357
aVCan you imagine that maybe one of them, in the morning,
p358
aVbent down to their child and hugged their child
p359
aVand said, "Dear, I'll be back later.
p360
aVI'm going out to defend your freedom, your lives.
p361
aVI'm going out to look out for us,
p362
aVthe future of our country."
p363
aVCan you imagine that?
p364
aVCan you imagine saying that?
p365
aVCan you go there?
p366
aVWhat do you think they're feeling?
p367
aVYou see, that's empathy.
p368
aVIt's also understanding.
p369
aa(lp370
V[understand]
p371
aa(lp372
VNow, you might ask,
p373
aV"OK, Sam, so why do you do this sort of thing?
p374
aVWhy would you use this example of all examples?"
p375
aVAnd I say, because.
p376
aVYou're allowed to hate these people.
p377
aVYou're allowed to just hate them with every fiber of your being.
p378
aVAnd if I can get you to step into their shoes
p379
aVand walk an inch \u2014 one tiny inch \u2014
p380
aVthen imagine the kind of sociological analysis
p381
aVthat you can do in all other aspects of your life.
p382
aVYou can walk a mile
p383
aVwhen it comes to understanding why that person's driving 40 miles per hour
p384
aVin the passing lane;
p385
aVor your teenage son;
p386
aVor your neighbor who annoys you by cutting his lawn on Sunday mornings.
p387
aVWhatever it is, you can go so far.
p388
aVAnd this is what I tell my students:
p389
aVstep outside of your tiny, little world.
p390
aVStep inside of the tiny, little world of somebody else.
p391
aVAnd then do it again
p392
aVand do it again and do it again.
p393
aVAnd suddenly, all these tiny, little worlds,
p394
aVthey come together in this complex web.
p395
aVAnd they build a big, complex world.
p396
aVAnd suddenly, without realizing it,
p397
aVyou're seeing the world differently.
p398
aVEverything has changed.
p399
aVEverything in your life has changed.
p400
aVAnd that's, of course, what this is about.
p401
aa(lp402
VAttend to other lives,
p403
aVother visions.
p404
aVListen to other people,
p405
aVenlighten ourselves.
p406
aVI'm not saying that I support the terrorists in Iraq.
p407
aVBut as a sociologist, what I am saying is:
p408
aVI understand.
p409
aVAnd now perhaps \u2014 perhaps \u2014 you do, too.
p410
aa(lp411
VThank you.
p412

VSo the first question is, why do we need to
p5
aVeven worry about a pandemic threat?
p6
aVWhat is it that we're concerned about?
p7
aVWhen I say "we," I'm at the Council on Foreign Relations.
p8
aVWe're concerned in the national security community,
p9
aVand of course in the biology community and the public health community.
p10
aVWhile globalization has increased travel,
p11
aVit's made it necessary that everybody be everywhere,
p12
aVall the time, all over the world.
p13
aVAnd that means that your microbial hitchhikers are moving with you.
p14
aVSo a plague outbreak in Surat, India
p15
aVbecomes not an obscure event, but a globalized event \u2014
p16
aVa globalized concern that has changed the risk equation.
p17
aVKatrina showed us
p18
aVthat we cannot completely depend on government
p19
aVto have readiness in hand, to be capable of handling things.
p20
aVIndeed, an outbreak would be multiple Katrinas at once.
p21
aa(lp22
VOur big concern at the moment is a virus called H5N1 flu \u2014
p23
aVsome of you call it bird flu \u2014
p24
aVwhich first emerged in southern China, in the mid-1990s,
p25
aVbut we didn't know about it until 1997.
p26
aVAt the end of last Christmas only 13 countries had seen H5N1.
p27
aVBut we're now up to 55 countries in the world,
p28
aVhave had this virus emerge,
p29
aVin either birds, or people or both.
p30
aVIn the bird outbreaks we now can see
p31
aVthat pretty much the whole world has seen this virus
p32
aVexcept the Americas.
p33
aVAnd I'll get into why we've so far been spared in a moment.
p34
aa(lp35
VIn domestic birds, especially chickens,
p36
aVit's 100 percent lethal.
p37
aVIt's one of the most lethal things we've seen
p38
aVin circulation in the world
p39
aVin any recent centuries.
p40
aVAnd we've dealt with it by killing off lots and lots and lots of chickens,
p41
aVand unfortunately often not reimbursing the peasant farmers
p42
aVwith the result that there's cover-up.
p43
aVIt's also carried on migration patterns
p44
aVof wild migratory aquatic birds.
p45
aVThere has been this centralized event
p46
aVin a place called Lake Chenghai, China.
p47
aVTwo years ago the migrating birds
p48
aVhad a multiple event
p49
aVwhere thousands died because of a mutation occurring
p50
aVin the virus,
p51
aVwhich made the species range broaden dramatically.
p52
aVSo that birds going to Siberia, to Europe, and to Africa
p53
aVcarried the virus, which had not previously been possible.
p54
aa(lp55
VWe're now seeing outbreaks in human populations \u2014
p56
aVso far, fortunately, small events,
p57
aVtiny outbreaks, occasional clusters.
p58
aVThe virus has mutated dramatically in the last two years
p59
aVto form two distinct families, if you will,
p60
aVof the H5N1 viral tree
p61
aVwith branches in them,
p62
aVand with different attributes that are worrying.
p63
aVSo what's concerning us? Well, first of all,
p64
aVat no time in history have we succeeded in making
p65
aVin a timely fashion, a specific vaccine
p66
aVfor more than 260 million people.
p67
aVIt's not going to do us very much good in a global pandemic.
p68
aVYou've heard about the vaccine we're stockpiling.
p69
aVBut nobody believes it will actually be particularly effective
p70
aVif we have a real outbreak.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo one thought is:
p73
aVafter 9/11, when the airports closed,
p74
aVour flu season was delayed by two weeks.
p75
aVSo the thought is, hey, maybe what we should do is just
p76
aVimmediately \u2014 we hear there is H5N1 spreading from human to human,
p77
aVthe virus has mutated to be a human-to-human transmitter \u2014
p78
aVlet's shut down the airports.
p79
aVHowever, huge supercomputer analyses,
p80
aVdone of the likely effectiveness of this,
p81
aVshow that it won't buy us much time at all.
p82
aVAnd of course it will be hugely disruptive in preparation plans.
p83
aVFor example, all masks are made in China.
p84
aVHow do you get them mobilized around the world
p85
aVif you've shut all the airports down?
p86
aVHow do you get the vaccines moved around the world
p87
aVand the drugs moved, and whatever may or not be available that would work.
p88
aVSo it turns out that shutting down the airports is counterproductive.
p89
aa(lp90
VWe're worried because this virus, unlike any other flu
p91
aVwe've ever studied, can be transmitted by eating raw meat
p92
aVof the infected animals.
p93
aVWe've seen transmission to wild cats and domestic cats,
p94
aVand now also domestic pet dogs.
p95
aVAnd in experimental feedings to rodents and ferrets,
p96
aVwe found that the animals exhibit symptoms never seen with flu:
p97
aVseizures, central nervous system disorders, partial paralysis.
p98
aVThis is not your normal garden-variety flu.
p99
aVIt mimics what we now understand
p100
aVabout reconstructing the 1918 flu virus,
p101
aVthe last great pandemic,
p102
aVin that it also jumped directly from birds to people.
p103
aVWe had evolution over time,
p104
aVand this unbelievable mortality rate in human beings:
p105
aV55 percent of people who have become infected
p106
aVwith H5N1 have, in fact, succumbed.
p107
aVAnd we don't have a huge number of people
p108
aVwho got infected and never developed disease.
p109
aa(lp110
VIn experimental feeding in monkeys
p111
aVyou can see that it actually downregulates
p112
aVa specific immune system modulator.
p113
aVThe result is that what kills you
p114
aVis not the virus directly, but your own immune system overreacting, saying,
p115
aV"Whatever this is so foreign I'm going berserk."
p116
aVThe result: most of the deaths
p117
aVhave been in people under 30 years of age,
p118
aVrobustly healthy young adults.
p119
aVWe have seen human-to-human transmission
p120
aVin at least three clusters \u2014
p121
aVfortunately involving very intimate contact,
p122
aVstill not putting the world at large at any kind of risk.
p123
aa(lp124
VAlright, so I've got you nervous.
p125
aVNow you probably assume, well the governments are going to do something.
p126
aVAnd we have spent a lot of money.
p127
aVMost of the spending in the Bush administration
p128
aVhas actually been more related to the anthrax results
p129
aVand bio-terrorism threat.
p130
aVBut a lot of money has been thrown out at the local level and at the federal level
p131
aVto look at infectious diseases.
p132
aVEnd result: only 15 states
p133
aVhave been certified to be able to do mass distribution
p134
aVof vaccine and drugs in a pandemic.
p135
aVHalf the states would run out of hospital beds
p136
aVin the first week, maybe two weeks.
p137
aVAnd 40 states already have an acute nursing shortage.
p138
aVAdd on pandemic threat, you're in big trouble.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo what have people been doing with this money?
p141
aVExercises, drills, all over the world.
p142
aVLet's pretend there's a pandemic.
p143
aVLet's everybody run around and play your role.
p144
aVMain result is that there is tremendous confusion.
p145
aVMost of these people don't actually know what their job will be.
p146
aVAnd the bottom line, major thing that has come through
p147
aVin every single drill: nobody knows who's in charge.
p148
aVNobody knows the chain of command.
p149
aVIf it were Los Angeles, is it the mayor, the governor,
p150
aVthe President of the United States, the head of Homeland Security?
p151
aVIn fact, the federal government says it's a guy called
p152
aVthe Principle Federal Officer,
p153
aVwho happens to be with TSA.
p154
aa(lp155
VThe government says
p156
aVthe federal responsibility will basically be
p157
aVabout trying to keep the virus out, which we all know is impossible,
p158
aVand then to mitigate the impact
p159
aVprimarily on our economy.
p160
aVThe rest is up to your local community.
p161
aVEverything is about your town, where you live.
p162
aVWell how good a city council you have,
p163
aVhow good a mayor you have \u2014 that's who's going to be in charge.
p164
aVMost local facilities would all be competing
p165
aVto try and get their hands on their piece
p166
aVof the federal stockpile of a drug called Tamiflu,
p167
aVwhich may or may not be helpful \u2014 I'll get into that \u2014
p168
aVof available vaccines, and any other treatments,
p169
aVand masks, and anything that's been stockpiled.
p170
aVAnd you'll have massive competition.
p171
aVNow we did purchase a vaccine, you've probably all heard about it,
p172
aVmade by Sanofi-Aventis.
p173
aVUnfortunately it's made against the current form of H5N1.
p174
aVWe know the virus will mutate. It will be a different virus.
p175
aVThe vaccine will probably be useless.
p176
aVSo here's where the decisions come in.
p177
aa(lp178
VYou're the mayor of your local town.
p179
aVLet's see, should we order that all pets be kept indoors?
p180
aVGermany did that when H5N1 appeared in Germany last year,
p181
aVin order to minimize the spread
p182
aVbetween households by household cats, dogs and so on.
p183
aVWhat do we do when we don't have any containment rooms
p184
aVwith reverse air that will allow the healthcare workers
p185
aVto take care of patients?
p186
aVThese are in Hong Kong; we have nothing like that here.
p187
aVWhat about quarantine?
p188
aVDuring the SARS epidemic in Beijing quarantine did seem to help.
p189
aVWe have no uniform policies
p190
aVregarding quarantine across the United States.
p191
aVAnd some states have differential policies, county by county.
p192
aVBut what about the no-brainer things? Should we close all the schools?
p193
aVWell then what about all the workers? They won't go to work
p194
aVif their kids aren't in school.
p195
aVEncouraging telecommuting? What works?
p196
aa(lp197
VWell the British government did a model of telecommuting.
p198
aVSix weeks they had all people in the banking industry
p199
aVpretend a pandemic was underway.
p200
aVWhat they found was, the core functions \u2014
p201
aVyou know you still sort of had banks,
p202
aVbut you couldn't get people to put money in the ATM machines.
p203
aVNobody was processing the credit cards.
p204
aVYour insurance payments didn't go through.
p205
aVAnd basically the economy would be in a disaster state of affairs.
p206
aVAnd that's just office workers, bankers.
p207
aa(lp208
VWe don't know how important hand washing is for flu \u2014
p209
aVshocking. One assumes it's a good idea to wash your hands a lot.
p210
aVBut actually in scientific community there is great debate
p211
aVabout what percentage of flu transmission between people
p212
aVis from sneezing and coughing
p213
aVand what percentage is on your hands.
p214
aVThe Institute of Medicine tried to look at the masking question.
p215
aVCan we figure out a way, since we know we won't have enough masks
p216
aVbecause we don't make them in America anymore,
p217
aVthey're all made in China \u2014
p218
aVdo we need N95? A state-of-the-art, top-of-the-line,
p219
aVmust-be-fitted-to-your-face mask?
p220
aVOr can we get away with some different kinds of masks?
p221
aVIn the SARS epidemic, we learned in Hong Kong
p222
aVthat most of transmission was because
p223
aVpeople were removing their masks improperly.
p224
aVAnd their hand got contaminated with the outside of the mask,
p225
aVand then they rubbed their nose. Bingo! They got SARS.
p226
aVIt wasn't flying microbes.
p227
aVIf you go online right now, you'll get so much phony-baloney information.
p228
aVYou'll end up buying \u2014 this is called an N95 mask. Ridiculous.
p229
aVWe don't actually have a standard
p230
aVfor what should be the protective gear for the first responders,
p231
aVthe people who will actually be there on the front lines.
p232
aa(lp233
VAnd Tamiflu. You've probably heard of this drug,
p234
aVmade by Hoffmann-La Roche, patented drug.
p235
aVThere is some indication
p236
aVthat it may buy you some time in the midst of an outbreak.
p237
aVShould you take Tamiflu for a long period of time,
p238
aVwell, one of the side effects is suicidal ideations.
p239
aVA public health survey analyzed the effect
p240
aVthat large-scale Tamiflu use would have,
p241
aVactually shows it counteractive
p242
aVto public health measures, making matters worse.
p243
aVAnd here is the other interesting thing:
p244
aVwhen a human being ingests Tamiflu, only 20 percent
p245
aVis metabolized appropriately
p246
aVto be an active compound in the human being.
p247
aVThe rest turns into a stable compound,
p248
aVwhich survives filtration into the water systems,
p249
aVthereby exposing the very aquatic birds that would carry flu
p250
aVand providing them a chance
p251
aVto breed resistant strains.
p252
aVAnd we now have seen Tamiflu-resistant strains
p253
aVin both Vietnam in person-to-person transmission,
p254
aVand in Egypt in person-to-person transmission.
p255
aVSo I personally think that our life expectancy
p256
aVfor Tamiflu as an effective drug
p257
aVis very limited \u2014 very limited indeed.
p258
aa(lp259
VNevertheless most of the governments
p260
aVhave based their whole flu policies
p261
aVon building stockpiles of Tamiflu.
p262
aVRussia has actually stockpiled enough
p263
aVfor 95 percent of all Russians.
p264
aVWe've stockpiled enough for 30 percent.
p265
aVWhen I say enough, that's two weeks worth.
p266
aVAnd then you're on your own because
p267
aVthe pandemic is going to last for 18 to 24 months.
p268
aVSome of the poorer countries
p269
aVthat have had the most experience with H5N1 have built up stockpiles;
p270
aVthey're already expired. They are already out of date.
p271
aVWhat do we know from 1918,
p272
aVthe last great pandemic?
p273
aVThe federal government abdicated most responsibility.
p274
aVAnd so we ended up with this wild patchwork of regulations
p275
aVall over America.
p276
aVEvery city, county, state did their own thing.
p277
aVAnd the rules
p278
aVand the belief systems were wildly disparate.
p279
aVIn some cases all schools, all churches,
p280
aVall public venues were closed.
p281
aa(lp282
VThe pandemic circulated three times in 18 months
p283
aVin the absence of commercial air travel.
p284
aVThe second wave was the mutated, super-killer wave.
p285
aVAnd in the first wave we had enough healthcare workers.
p286
aVBut by the time the second wave hit
p287
aVit took such a toll among the healthcare workers
p288
aVthat we lost most of our doctors and nurses that were on the front lines.
p289
aVOverall we lost 700,000 people.
p290
aVThe virus was 100 percent lethal to pregnant women
p291
aVand we don't actually know why.
p292
aVMost of the death toll was 15 to 40 year-olds \u2014
p293
aVrobustly healthy young adults.
p294
aVIt was likened to the plague.
p295
aVWe don't actually know how many people died.
p296
aVThe low-ball estimate is 35 million.
p297
aVThis was based on European and North American data.
p298
aa(lp299
VA new study by Chris Murray at Harvard
p300
aVshows that if you look at the databases that were kept
p301
aVby the Brits in India,
p302
aVthere was a 31-fold greater death rate among the Indians.
p303
aVSo there is a strong belief that in places of poverty
p304
aVthe death toll was far higher.
p305
aVAnd that a more likely toll
p306
aVis somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 to 100 million people
p307
aVbefore we had commercial air travel.
p308
aVSo are we ready?
p309
aVAs a nation, no we're not.
p310
aVAnd I think even those in the leadership
p311
aVwould say that is the case,
p312
aVthat we still have a long ways to go.
p313
aa(lp314
VSo what does that mean for you? Well the first thing is,
p315
aVI wouldn't start building up personal stockpiles of anything \u2014
p316
aVfor yourself, your family, or your employees \u2014
p317
aVunless you've really done your homework.
p318
aVWhat mask works, what mask doesn't work.
p319
aVHow many masks do you need?
p320
aVThe Institute of Medicine study felt that
p321
aVyou could not recycle masks.
p322
aVWell if you think it's going to last 18 months,
p323
aVare you going to buy 18 months worth of masks
p324
aVfor every single person in your family?
p325
aa(lp326
VWe don't know \u2014 again with Tamiflu,
p327
aVthe number one side effect of Tamiflu is
p328
aVflu-like symptoms.
p329
aVSo then how can you tell
p330
aVwho in your family has the flu
p331
aVif everybody is taking Tamiflu?
p332
aVIf you expand that out to think of a whole community,
p333
aVor all your employees in your company,
p334
aVyou begin to realize how limited
p335
aVthe Tamiflu option might be.
p336
aVEverybody has come up to me and said,
p337
aVwell I'll stockpile water or, I'll stockpile food, or what have you.
p338
aVBut really? Do you really have a place
p339
aVto stockpile 18 months worth of food? Twenty-four months worth of food?
p340
aVDo you want to view the pandemic threat
p341
aVthe way back in the 1950s
p342
aVpeople viewed the civil defense issue,
p343
aVand build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu?
p344
aVI don't think that's rational.
p345
aa(lp346
VI think it's about having to be prepared
p347
aVas communities, not as individuals \u2014
p348
aVbeing prepared as nation,
p349
aVbeing prepared as state, being prepared as town.
p350
aVAnd right now most of the preparedness
p351
aVis deeply flawed.
p352
aVAnd I hope I've convinced you of that,
p353
aVwhich means that the real job is go out and
p354
aVsay to your local leaders,
p355
aVand your national leaders,
p356
aV"Why haven't you solved these problems?
p357
aVWhy are you still thinking that
p358
aVthe lessons of Katrina do not apply to flu?"
p359
aVAnd put the pressure where the pressure needs to be put.
p360
aVBut I guess the other thing to add is,
p361
aVif you do have employees, and you do have a company,
p362
aVI think you have certain responsibilities
p363
aVto demonstrate that you are thinking ahead for them,
p364
aVand you are trying to plan.
p365
aVAt a minimum the British banking plan showed that
p366
aVtelecommuting can be helpful.
p367
aVIt probably does reduce exposure
p368
aVbecause people are not coming into the office and coughing on each other,
p369
aVor touching common objects
p370
aVand sharing things via their hands.
p371
aVBut can you sustain your company that way?
p372
aVWell if you have a dot-com, maybe you can.
p373
aVOtherwise you're in trouble.
p374
aVHappy to take your questions.
p375
aV(Applause)
p376
aa(lp377
VAudience member: What factors determine the duration of a pandemic?
p378
aa(lp379
VLaurie Garret: What factors determine the duration of a pandemic, we don't really know.
p380
aVI could give you a bunch of flip, this, that, and the other.
p381
aVBut I would say that honestly we don't know.
p382
aVClearly the bottom line is
p383
aVthe virus eventually attenuates,
p384
aVand ceases to be a lethal virus to humanity,
p385
aVand finds other hosts.
p386
aVBut we don't really know how and why that happens.
p387
aVIt's a very complicated ecology.
p388
aa(lp389
VAudience member: What kind of triggers are you looking for?
p390
aVYou know way more than any of us.
p391
aVTo say ahh, if this happens then we are going to have a pandemic?
p392
aa(lp393
VLG: The moment that you see any evidence
p394
aVof serious human-to-human to transmission.
p395
aVNot just intimately between family members
p396
aVwho took care of an ailing sister or brother,
p397
aVbut a community infected \u2014
p398
aVspread within a school,
p399
aVspread within a dormitory, something of that nature.
p400
aVThen I think that there is universal agreement
p401
aVnow, at WHO all the way down:
p402
aVSend out the alert.
p403
aa(lp404
VAudience member: Some research has indicated that statins can be helpful.
p405
aVCan you talk about that?
p406
aa(lp407
VLG: Yeah. There is some evidence that taking Lipitor
p408
aVand other common statins for cholesterol control
p409
aVmay decrease your vulnerability
p410
aVto influenza.
p411
aVBut we do not completely understand why.
p412
aVThe mechanism isn't clear.
p413
aVAnd I don't know that there is any way
p414
aVresponsibly for someone to start
p415
aVmedicating their children
p416
aVwith their personal supply of Lipitor or something of that nature.
p417
aVWe have absolutely no idea what that would do.
p418
aVYou might be causing some very dangerous outcomes
p419
aVin your children, doing such a thing.
p420
aa(lp421
VAudience member: How far along are we in being able to determine
p422
aVwhether someone is actually carrying, whether somebody has this
p423
aVbefore the symptoms are full-blown?
p424
aa(lp425
VLG: Right. So I have for a long time said
p426
aVthat what we really needed was a rapid diagnostic.
p427
aVAnd our Centers for Disease Control
p428
aVhas labeled a test they developed
p429
aVa rapid diagnostic.
p430
aVIt takes 24 hours in a very highly developed laboratory,
p431
aVin highly skilled hands.
p432
aVI'm thinking dipstick.
p433
aVYou could do it to your own kid. It changes color.
p434
aVIt tells you if you have H5N1.
p435
aVIn terms of where we are in science
p436
aVwith DNA identification capacities and so on,
p437
aVit's not that far off.
p438
aVBut we're not there. And there hasn't been the kind of investment to get us there.
p439
aa(lp440
VAudience member: In the 1918 flu I understand that
p441
aVthey theorized that there was some attenuation
p442
aVof the virus when it made the leap into humans.
p443
aVIs that likely, do you think, here?
p444
aVI mean 100 percent death rate
p445
aVis pretty severe.
p446
aa(lp447
VLG: Um yeah. So we don't actually know
p448
aVwhat the lethality was
p449
aVof the 1918 strain to wild birds
p450
aVbefore it jumped from birds to humans.
p451
aVIt's curious that there is no evidence
p452
aVof mass die-offs of chickens
p453
aVor household birds across America
p454
aVbefore the human pandemic happened.
p455
aVThat may be because those events
p456
aVwere occurring on the other side of the world
p457
aVwhere nobody was paying attention.
p458
aVBut the virus clearly
p459
aVwent through one round around the world
p460
aVin a mild enough form
p461
aVthat the British army in World War I
p462
aVactually certified that it was not a threat
p463
aVand would not affect the outcome of the war.
p464
aVAnd after circulating around the world
p465
aVcame back in a form that was tremendously lethal.
p466
aVWhat percentage of infected people were killed by it?
p467
aVAgain we don't really know for sure.
p468
aVIt's clear that if you were malnourished to begin with,
p469
aVyou had a weakened immune system,
p470
aVyou lived in poverty in India or Africa,
p471
aVyour likelihood of dying was far greater.
p472
aVBut we don't really know.
p473
aa(lp474
VAudience member: One of the things I've heard is that
p475
aVthe real death cause when you get a flu is the associated pneumonia,
p476
aVand that a pneumonia vaccine
p477
aVmay offer you 50 percent better chance of survival.
p478
aa(lp479
VLG: For a long time, researchers in emerging diseases
p480
aVwere kind of dismissive of the pandemic flu threat
p481
aVon the grounds that
p482
aVback in 1918 they didn't have antibiotics.
p483
aVAnd that most people who die of regular flu \u2014
p484
aVwhich in regular flu years
p485
aVis about 360,000 people worldwide,
p486
aVmost of them senior citizens \u2014
p487
aVand they die not of the flu but because the flu gives an assault to their immune system.
p488
aVAnd along comes pneumococcus
p489
aVor another bacteria, streptococcus
p490
aVand boom, they get a bacterial pneumonia.
p491
aVBut it turns out that in 1918 that was not the case at all.
p492
aVAnd so far in the H5N1 cases in people,
p493
aVsimilarly bacterial infection
p494
aVhas not been an issue at all.
p495
aVIt's this absolutely phenomenal disruption of the immune system
p496
aVthat is the key to why people die of this virus.
p497
aa(lp498
VAnd I would just add
p499
aVwe saw the same thing with SARS.
p500
aVSo what's going on here is your body says,
p501
aVyour immune system sends out all its sentinels and says,
p502
aV"I don't know what the heck this is.
p503
aVWe've never seen anything even remotely like this before."
p504
aVIt won't do any good to bring in the sharpshooters
p505
aVbecause those antibodies aren't here.
p506
aVAnd it won't do any good to bring in the tanks and the artillery
p507
aVbecause those T-cells don't recognize it either.
p508
aVSo we're going to have to go all-out thermonuclear response,
p509
aVstimulate the total cytokine cascade.
p510
aVThe whole immune system swarms into the lungs.
p511
aVAnd yes they die, drowning in their own fluids, of pneumonia.
p512
aVBut it's not bacterial pneumonia.
p513
aVAnd it's not a pneumonia that would respond to a vaccine.
p514
aVAnd I think my time is up. I thank you all for your attention.
p515
aV(Applause)

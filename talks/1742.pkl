V"Don't talk to strangers."
p5
aa(lp6
VYou have heard that phrase uttered
p7
aVby your friends, family, schools and the media for decades.
p8
aVIt's a norm. It's a social norm.
p9
aVBut it's a special kind of social norm,
p10
aVbecause it's a social norm that wants to tell us
p11
aVwho we can relate to and who we shouldn't relate to.
p12
aV"Don't talk to strangers" says,
p13
aV"Stay from anyone who's not familiar to you.
p14
aVStick with the people you know.
p15
aVStick with people like you."
p16
aa(lp17
VHow appealing is that?
p18
aVIt's not really what we do, is it, when we're at our best?
p19
aVWhen we're at our best, we reach out to people
p20
aVwho are not like us,
p21
aVbecause when we do that, we learn from people
p22
aVwho are not like us.
p23
aa(lp24
VMy phrase for this value of being with "not like us"
p25
aVis "strangeness,"
p26
aVand my point is that in today's digitally intensive world,
p27
aVstrangers are quite frankly not the point.
p28
aVThe point that we should be worried about is,
p29
aVhow much strangeness are we getting?
p30
aa(lp31
VWhy strangeness? Because our social relations
p32
aVare increasingly mediated by data,
p33
aVand data turns our social relations into digital relations,
p34
aVand that means that our digital relations
p35
aVnow depend extraordinarily on technology
p36
aVto bring to them a sense of robustness,
p37
aVa sense of discovery,
p38
aVa sense of surprise and unpredictability.
p39
aVWhy not strangers?
p40
aVBecause strangers are part of a world
p41
aVof really rigid boundaries.
p42
aVThey belong to a world of people I know
p43
aVversus people I don't know,
p44
aVand in the context of my digital relations,
p45
aVI'm already doing things with people I don't know.
p46
aVThe question isn't whether or not I know you.
p47
aVThe question is, what can I do with you?
p48
aVWhat can I learn with you?
p49
aVWhat can we do together that benefits us both?
p50
aa(lp51
VI spend a lot of time thinking about
p52
aVhow the social landscape is changing,
p53
aVhow new technologies create new constraints
p54
aVand new opportunities for people.
p55
aVThe most important changes facing us today
p56
aVhave to do with data and what data is doing
p57
aVto shape the kinds of digital relations
p58
aVthat will be possible for us in the future.
p59
aVThe economies of the future depend on that.
p60
aVOur social lives in the future depend on that.
p61
aVThe threat to worry about isn't strangers.
p62
aVThe threat to worry about is whether or not
p63
aVwe're getting our fair share of strangeness.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow, 20th-century psychologists and sociologists
p66
aVwere thinking about strangers,
p67
aVbut they weren't thinking so dynamically about human relations,
p68
aVand they were thinking about strangers
p69
aVin the context of influencing practices.
p70
aVStanley Milgram from the '60s and '70s,
p71
aVthe creator of the small-world experiments,
p72
aVwhich became later popularized as six degrees of separation,
p73
aVmade the point that any two arbitrarily selected people
p74
aVwere likely connected from between five to seven intermediary steps.
p75
aVHis point was that strangers are out there.
p76
aVWe can reach them. There are paths
p77
aVthat enable us to reach them.
p78
aVMark Granovetter, Stanford sociologist, in 1973
p79
aVin his seminal essay "The Strength of Weak Ties,"
p80
aVmade the point that these weak ties
p81
aVthat are a part of our networks, these strangers,
p82
aVare actually more effective at diffusing information to us
p83
aVthan are our strong ties, the people closest to us.
p84
aVHe makes an additional indictment of our strong ties
p85
aVwhen he says that these people who are so close to us,
p86
aVthese strong ties in our lives,
p87
aVactually have a homogenizing effect on us.
p88
aVThey produce sameness.
p89
aa(lp90
VMy colleagues and I at Intel have spent the last few years
p91
aVlooking at the ways in which digital platforms
p92
aVare reshaping our everyday lives,
p93
aVwhat kinds of new routines are possible.
p94
aVWe've been looking specifically at the kinds
p95
aVof digital platforms that have enabled us
p96
aVto take our possessions, those things that used to be
p97
aVvery restricted to us and to our friends in our houses,
p98
aVand to make them available to people we don't know.
p99
aVWhether it's our clothes, whether it's our cars,
p100
aVwhether it's our bikes, whether it's our books or music,
p101
aVwe are able to take our possessions now
p102
aVand make them available to people we've never met.
p103
aVAnd we concluded a very important insight,
p104
aVwhich was that as people's relationships
p105
aVto the things in their lives change,
p106
aVso do their relations with other people.
p107
aVAnd yet recommendation system
p108
aVafter recommendation system continues to miss the boat.
p109
aVIt continues to try to predict what I need
p110
aVbased on some past characterization of who I am,
p111
aVof what I've already done.
p112
aVSecurity technology after security technology
p113
aVcontinues to design data protection
p114
aVin terms of threats and attacks,
p115
aVkeeping me locked into really rigid kinds of relations.
p116
aa(lp117
VCategories like "friends" and "family"
p118
aVand "contacts" and "colleagues"
p119
aVdon't tell me anything about my actual relations.
p120
aVA more effective way to think about my relations
p121
aVmight be in terms of closeness and distance,
p122
aVwhere at any given point in time, with any single person,
p123
aVI am both close and distant from that individual,
p124
aVall as a function of what I need to do right now.
p125
aVPeople aren't close or distant.
p126
aVPeople are always a combination of the two,
p127
aVand that combination is constantly changing.
p128
aa(lp129
VWhat if technologies could intervene
p130
aVto disrupt the balance of certain kinds of relationships?
p131
aVWhat if technologies could intervene
p132
aVto help me find the person that I need right now?
p133
aVStrangeness is that calibration
p134
aVof closeness and distance
p135
aVthat enables me to find the people that I need right now,
p136
aVthat enables me to find the sources of intimacy,
p137
aVof discovery, and of inspiration that I need right now.
p138
aVStrangeness is not about meeting strangers.
p139
aVIt simply makes the point that we need
p140
aVto disrupt our zones of familiarity.
p141
aVSo jogging those zones of familiarity is one way to think about strangeness,
p142
aVand it's a problem faced not just by individuals today,
p143
aVbut also by organizations,
p144
aVorganizations that are trying to embrace massively new opportunities.
p145
aVWhether you're a political party
p146
aVinsisting to your detriment on a very rigid notion
p147
aVof who belongs and who does not,
p148
aVwhether you're the government
p149
aVprotecting social institutions like marriage
p150
aVand restricting access of those institutions to the few,
p151
aVwhether you're a teenager in her bedroom
p152
aVwho's trying to jostle her relations with her parents,
p153
aVstrangeness is a way to think about how we pave the way
p154
aVto new kinds of relations.
p155
aVWe have to change the norms.
p156
aVWe have to change the norms in order to enable
p157
aVnew kinds of technologies
p158
aVas a basis for new kinds of businesses.
p159
aa(lp160
VWhat interesting questions lie ahead for us
p161
aVin this world of no strangers?
p162
aVHow might we think differently about our relations with people?
p163
aVHow might we think differently about our relations
p164
aVwith distributed groups of people?
p165
aVHow might we think differently about our relations with technologies,
p166
aVthings that effectively become social participants
p167
aVin their own right?
p168
aVThe range of digital relations is extraordinary.
p169
aVIn the context of this broad range of digital relations,
p170
aVsafely seeking strangeness might very well be
p171
aVa new basis for that innovation.
p172
aa(lp173
VThank you.

VThis technology
p5
aVmade a very important impact on us.
p6
aVIt changed the way our history developed.
p7
aVBut it's a technology so pervasive,
p8
aVso invisible,
p9
aVthat we, for a long time,
p10
aVforgot to take it into account
p11
aVwhen we talked about
p12
aVhuman evolution.
p13
aVBut we see the results of this technology, still.
p14
aVSo let's make a little test.
p15
aVSo everyone of you turns to their neighbor please.
p16
aVTurn and face your neighbors.
p17
aVPlease, also on the balcony.
p18
aVSmile. Smile. Open the mouths.
p19
aVSmile, friendly.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aVDo you \u2014
p22
aVDo you see any Canine teeth?
p23
aV(Laughter)
p24
aVCount Dracula teeth
p25
aVin the mouths of your neighbors?
p26
aVOf course not.
p27
aVBecause our dental anatomy
p28
aVis actually made,
p29
aVnot for tearing down raw meat from bones
p30
aVor chewing fibrous leaves for hours.
p31
aVIt is made for a diet
p32
aVwhich is soft, mushy,
p33
aVwhich is reduced in fibers,
p34
aVwhich is very easily chewable
p35
aVand digestible.
p36
aVSounds like fast food, doesn't it.
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VIt's for cooked food.
p41
aVWe carry in our face the proof
p42
aVthat cooking,
p43
aVfood transformation,
p44
aVmade us what we are.
p45
aVSo I would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves.
p46
aVWe talk about ourselves as omnivores.
p47
aVI would say, we should call ourselves coctivors \u2014
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aVfrom coquere, to cook.
p50
aVWe are the animals
p51
aVwho eat cooked food.
p52
aVNo, no, no, no. Better \u2014
p53
aVto live of cooked food.
p54
aVSo cooking is a very important technology.
p55
aVIt's technology.
p56
aVI don't know how you feel,
p57
aVbut I like to cook for entertainment.
p58
aVAnd you need some design
p59
aVto be successful.
p60
aVSo, cooking is a very important technology,
p61
aVbecause it allowed us to acquire
p62
aVwhat brought you all here:
p63
aVthe big brain,
p64
aVthis wonderful cerebral cortex we have.
p65
aVBecause brains are expensive.
p66
aVThose have to pay tuition fees know.
p67
aV(Laughter)
p68
aVBut it's also, metabolically speaking, expensive.
p69
aVYou now, our brain is two to three percent of the body mass,
p70
aVbut actually it uses 25 percent of the total energy we use.
p71
aVIt's very expensive.
p72
aVWhere does the energy come from. Of course, from food.
p73
aVIf we eat raw food,
p74
aVwe cannot release really the energy.
p75
aVSo this ingenuity of our ancestors,
p76
aVto invent this most marvelous technology.
p77
aVInvisible \u2014 everyone of us does it every day, so to speak.
p78
aVCooking made it possible
p79
aVthat mutations,
p80
aVnatural selections, our environment,
p81
aVcould develop us.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo if we think about
p84
aVthis unleashing human potential,
p85
aVwhich was possible by cooking and food,
p86
aVwhy do we talk so badly about food?
p87
aVWhy is it always do and don'ts
p88
aVand it's good for you, it's not good for you?
p89
aVI think the good news for me
p90
aVwould be if we could go back
p91
aVand talk about the unleashing,
p92
aVthe continuation of the unleashing of human potential.
p93
aVNow, cooking allowed also
p94
aVthat we became a migrant species.
p95
aVWe walked out of Africa two times.
p96
aVWe populated all the ecologies.
p97
aVIf you can cook, nothing can happen to you,
p98
aVbecause whatever you find,
p99
aVyou will try to transform it.
p100
aVIt keeps also your brain working.
p101
aVNow the very easy and simple technology
p102
aVwhich was developed
p103
aVactually runs after this formula.
p104
aVTake something which looks like food, transform it,
p105
aVand it gives you a good, very easy, accessible energy.
p106
aa(lp107
VThis technology affected two organs,
p108
aVthe brain and the gut, which it actually affected.
p109
aVThe brain could grow, but the gut actually shrunk.
p110
aVOkay, it's not obvious to be honest.
p111
aV(Laughter)
p112
aVBut it shrunk to 60 percent
p113
aVof primate gut
p114
aVof my body mass.
p115
aVSo because of having cooked food,
p116
aVit's easier to digest.
p117
aVNow having a large brain, as you know,
p118
aVis a big advantage,
p119
aVbecause you can actually influence your environment.
p120
aVYou can influence your own technologies you have invented.
p121
aVYou can continue to innovate and invent.
p122
aVNow the big brain did this also with cooking.
p123
aVBut how did it actually run this show?
p124
aVHow did it actually interfere?
p125
aVWhat kind of criteria did it use?
p126
aVAnd this is actually taste reward and energy.
p127
aVYou know we have up to five tastes,
p128
aVthree of them sustain us.
p129
aVSweet \u2014 energy.
p130
aVUmami \u2014 this is a meaty taste.
p131
aVYou need proteins for muscles, recovery.
p132
aVSalty,
p133
aVbecause you need salt, otherwise your electric body will not work.
p134
aVAnd two tastes which protect you \u2014
p135
aVbitter and sour,
p136
aVwhich are against
p137
aVpoisonous and rotten material.
p138
aVBut of course, they are hard-wired
p139
aVbut we use them still in a sophisticated way.
p140
aVThink about bittersweet chocolate;
p141
aVor think about the acidity
p142
aVof yogurt \u2014 wonderful \u2014
p143
aVmixed with strawberry fruits.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing
p146
aVbecause we know
p147
aVthat, in cooking, we can transform it
p148
aVto the form.
p149
aVReward: this is a more complex
p150
aVand especially integrative
p151
aVform of our brain
p152
aVwith various different elements \u2014
p153
aVthe external states, our internal states,
p154
aVhow do we feel, and so on are put together.
p155
aVAnd something which maybe you don't like
p156
aVbut you are so hungry that you really will be satisfied to eat.
p157
aVSo satisfaction was a very important part.
p158
aVAnd as I say, energy was necessary.
p159
aa(lp160
VNow how did the gut actually
p161
aVparticipate in this development?
p162
aVAnd the gut is a silent voice \u2014
p163
aVit's going more for feelings.
p164
aVI use the euphemism digestive comfort \u2014
p165
aVactually \u2014 it's a digestive discomfort,
p166
aVwhich the gut is concerned with.
p167
aVIf you get a stomach ache, if you get a little bit bloated,
p168
aVwas not the right food, was not the right cooking manipulation
p169
aVor maybe other things went wrong.
p170
aVSo my story is a tale of two brains,
p171
aVbecause it might surprise you,
p172
aVour gut has a full-fledged brain.
p173
aVAll the managers in the room say,
p174
aV"You don't tell me something new, because we know, gut feeling.
p175
aVThis is what we are using."
p176
aV(Laughter)
p177
aVAnd actually you use it and it's actually useful.
p178
aVBecause our gut is connected to our emotional limbic system,
p179
aVthey do speak with each other
p180
aVand make decisions.
p181
aVBut what it means
p182
aVto have a brain there
p183
aVis that, not only the big brain
p184
aVhas to talk with the food,
p185
aVthe food has to talk with the brain,
p186
aVbecause we have to learn actually
p187
aVhow to talk to the brains.
p188
aa(lp189
VNow if there's a gut brain,
p190
aVwe should also learn to talk with this brain.
p191
aVNow 150 years ago,
p192
aVanatomists described very, very carefully \u2014
p193
aVhere is a model of a wall of a gut.
p194
aVI took the three elements \u2014
p195
aVstomach, small intestine and colon.
p196
aVAnd within this structure,
p197
aVyou see these two pinkish layers,
p198
aVwhich are actually the muscle.
p199
aVAnd between this muscle, they found nervous tissues,
p200
aVa lot of nervous tissues,
p201
aVwhich penetrate actually the muscle \u2014
p202
aVpenetrate the submucosa,
p203
aVwhere you have all the elements for the immune system.
p204
aVThe gut is actually the largest immune system,
p205
aVdefending your body.
p206
aVIt penetrates the mucosa.
p207
aVThis is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing
p208
aVand you digest,
p209
aVwhich is actually the lumen.
p210
aVNow if you think about the gut,
p211
aVthe gut is \u2014 if you could stretch it \u2014
p212
aV40 meters long,
p213
aVthe length of a tennis court.
p214
aVIf we could unroll it,
p215
aVget out all the folds and so on,
p216
aVit would have 400 sq. meters of surface.
p217
aa(lp218
VAnd now this brain takes care over this,
p219
aVto move it with the muscles and to do defend the surface
p220
aVand, of course, digest our food we cook.
p221
aVSo if we give you a specification,
p222
aVthis brain, which is autonomous,
p223
aVhave 500 million nerve cells,
p224
aV100 million neurons \u2014
p225
aVso around the size of a cat brain,
p226
aVso there sleeps a little cat \u2014
p227
aVthinks for itself,
p228
aVoptimizes whatever it digests.
p229
aVIt has 20 different neuron types.
p230
aVIt's got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain,
p231
aVwhere you have 100 billion neurons.
p232
aVIt has autonomous organized microcircuits,
p233
aVhas these programs which run.
p234
aVIt senses the food; it knows exactly what to do.
p235
aVIt senses it by chemical means
p236
aVand very importantly by mechanical means,
p237
aVbecause it has to move the food \u2014
p238
aVit has to mix all the various elements
p239
aVwhich we need for digestion.
p240
aVThis control of muscle is very, very important,
p241
aVbecause, you know, there can be reflexes.
p242
aVIf you don't like a food, especially if you're a child, you gag.
p243
aVIt's this brain which makes this reflex.
p244
aVAnd then finally,
p245
aVit controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery,
p246
aVwhich actually digests the food we cook.
p247
aa(lp248
VNow how do the two brains work with each other?
p249
aVI took here a model from robotics \u2014
p250
aVit's called the Subsumption Architecture.
p251
aVWhat it means is that we have a layered control system.
p252
aVThe lower layer, our gut brain,
p253
aVhas its own goals \u2014 digestion defense \u2014
p254
aVand we have the higher brain
p255
aVwith the goal of integration
p256
aVand generating behaviors.
p257
aVNow both look \u2014 and this is the blue arrows \u2014
p258
aVboth look to the same food, which is in the lumen
p259
aVand in the area of your intestine.
p260
aVThe big brain integrates signals,
p261
aVwhich come from the running programs
p262
aVof the lower brain,
p263
aVBut subsumption means
p264
aVthat the higher brain can interfere with the lower.
p265
aVIt can replace,
p266
aVor it can inhibit actually, signals.
p267
aVSo if we take two types of signals \u2014
p268
aVa hunger signal for example.
p269
aVIf you have an empty stomach,
p270
aVyour stomach produces a hormone called ghrelin.
p271
aVIt's a very big signal;
p272
aVit's sent to the brain says,
p273
aV"Go and eat."
p274
aVYou have stop signals \u2014
p275
aVwe have up to eight stop signals.
p276
aVAt least in my case,
p277
aVthey are not listened to.
p278
aV(Laughter)
p279
aa(lp280
VSo what happens
p281
aVif the big brain in the integration
p282
aVoverrides the signal?
p283
aVSo if you override the hunger signal,
p284
aVyou can have a disorder, which is called anorexia.
p285
aVDespite generating
p286
aVa healthy hunger signal,
p287
aVthe big brain ignores it
p288
aVand activates different programs in the gut.
p289
aVThe more usual case
p290
aVis overeating.
p291
aVIt actually takes the signal
p292
aVand changes it,
p293
aVand we continue,
p294
aVeven [though] our eight signals would say, "Stop, enough.
p295
aVWe have transferred enough energy."
p296
aVNow the interesting thing is that,
p297
aValong this lower layer \u2014 this gut \u2014
p298
aVthe signal becomes stronger and stronger
p299
aVif undigested, but digestible, material
p300
aVcould penetrate.
p301
aVThis we found from bariatric surgery.
p302
aVThat then the signal would be very, very high.
p303
aa(lp304
VSo now back to the cooking question
p305
aVand back to the design.
p306
aVWe have learned to talk to the big brain \u2014
p307
aVtaste and reward, as you know.
p308
aVNow what would be the language
p309
aVwe have to talk to the gut brain
p310
aVthat its signals are so strong
p311
aVthat the big brain cannot ignore it?
p312
aVThen we would generate something
p313
aVall of us would like to have \u2014
p314
aVa balance between the hunger
p315
aVand the satiation.
p316
aVNow I give you, from our research, a very short claim.
p317
aVThis is fat digestion.
p318
aVYou have on your left
p319
aVan olive oil droplet,
p320
aVand this olive oil droplet gets attacked by enzymes.
p321
aVThis is an in vitro experiment.
p322
aVIt's very difficult to work in the intestine.
p323
aVNow everyone would expect
p324
aVthat when the degradation of the oil happens,
p325
aVwhen the constituents are liberated,
p326
aVthey disappear, they go away
p327
aVbecause they [were] absorbed.
p328
aVActually, what happens is that a very intricate structure appears.
p329
aVAnd I hope you can see
p330
aVthat there are some ring-like structures in the middle image,
p331
aVwhich is water.
p332
aVThis whole system generates a huge surface
p333
aVto allow more enzymes
p334
aVto attack the remaining oil.
p335
aVAnd finally, on your right side,
p336
aVyou see a bubbly,
p337
aVcell-like structure appearing,
p338
aVfrom which the body will absorb the fat.
p339
aVNow if we could take this language \u2014
p340
aVand this is a language of structures \u2014
p341
aVand make it longer-lasting,
p342
aVthat it can go through
p343
aVthe passage of the intestine,
p344
aVit would generate stronger signals.
p345
aa(lp346
VSo our research \u2014
p347
aVand I think the research also at the universities \u2014
p348
aVare now fixing on these points
p349
aVto say: how can we actually \u2014
p350
aVand this might sound trivial now to you \u2014
p351
aVhow can we change cooking?
p352
aVHow can we cook
p353
aVthat we have this language developed?
p354
aVSo what we have actually, it's not an omnivore's dilemma.
p355
aVWe have a coctivor's opportunity,
p356
aVbecause we have learned over the last two million years
p357
aVwhich taste and reward \u2014
p358
aVquite sophisticated to cook \u2014
p359
aVto please ourselves, to satisfy ourselves.
p360
aVIf we add the matrix,
p361
aVif we add the structure language, which we have to learn,
p362
aVwhen we learn it, then we can put it back;
p363
aVand around energy,
p364
aVwe could generate a balance,
p365
aVwhich comes out
p366
aVfrom our really primordial operation: cooking.
p367
aVSo, to make cooking really
p368
aVa very important element,
p369
aVI would say even philosophers have to change
p370
aVand have to finally recognize
p371
aVthat cooking is what made us.
p372
aa(lp373
VSo I would say, coquo ergo sum:
p374
aVI cook, therefore I am.
p375
aVThank you very much.

Research on food has previously focused on its sensory qualities -- taste, aroma, texture. But there is much more to know. How does food&#39;s biological structure determine its quality, its digestibility, its nutritional qualities? What&#39;s the science of turning a biological structure (for instance, a kernel of grain) into something humans can make into pure energy (for instance, a slice of bread)? His team has been looking recently at the impact of food structure on fat digestion, in support of the fight against obesity. How much fat is needed to feel full?

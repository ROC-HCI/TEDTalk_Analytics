VI believe big institutions
p5
aVhave unique potential to create change,
p6
aVand I believe that we as individuals
p7
aVhave unique power
p8
aVto influence the direction that those institutions take.
p9
aa(lp10
VNow, these beliefs did not come naturally to me,
p11
aVbecause trusting big institutions,
p12
aVnot really part of my family legacy.
p13
aVMy mother escaped North Korea
p14
aVwhen she was 10 years old.
p15
aVTo do so, she had to elude every big institution in her life:
p16
aVrepressive governments, occupying armies
p17
aVand even armed border patrols.
p18
aVLater, when she decided she wanted to emigrate to the United States,
p19
aVshe had to defy an entire culture
p20
aVthat said the girls would never be the best and brightest.
p21
aVOnly because her name happens to sound like a boy's
p22
aVwas she able to finagle her way into the government immigration exam
p23
aVto come to the United States.
p24
aa(lp25
VBecause of her bravery and passion,
p26
aVI've had all the opportunities that she never did,
p27
aVand that has made my story so different.
p28
aVInstead of running away from big institutions,
p29
aVI've actually run toward them.
p30
aVI've had the chance over the course of my career
p31
aVto work for The Wall Street Journal,
p32
aVthe White House
p33
aVand now one of the largest financial institutions in the world,
p34
aVwhere I lead sustainable investing.
p35
aa(lp36
VNow, these institutions are like tankers,
p37
aVand working inside of them,
p38
aVI've come to appreciate what large wakes they can leave,
p39
aVand I've become convinced
p40
aVthat the institution of the global capital markets,
p41
aVthe nearly 290 trillion dollars of stocks and bonds in the world,
p42
aVthat that may be one of our most powerful forces
p43
aVfor positive social change at our disposal,
p44
aVif we ask it to be.
p45
aa(lp46
VNow, I know some of you are thinking,
p47
aVglobal capital markets, positive social change,
p48
aVnot usually in the same sentence or even the same paragraph.
p49
aVI think many people think of the capital markets
p50
aVkind of like an ocean.
p51
aVIt's a vast, impersonal, uncaring force of nature
p52
aVthat is not affected by our wishes or desires.
p53
aVSo the best that our little savings accounts
p54
aVor retirement accounts can do
p55
aVis to try to catch some waves in the good cycles
p56
aVand hope that we don't get inundated in the turbulent ones,
p57
aVbut certainly our decisions on how to steer our little retirement accounts
p58
aVdon't affect the tides,
p59
aVdon't change the shape or size or direction of the waves.
p60
aa(lp61
VBut why is that?
p62
aVBecause actually, one third of this ocean of capital
p63
aVactually belongs to individuals like us,
p64
aVand most of the rest of the capital markets
p65
aVis controlled by the institutions that get their power and authority
p66
aVand their capital from us,
p67
aVas members, participants, beneficiaries, shareholders or citizens.
p68
aVSo if we are the ultimate owners of the capital markets,
p69
aVwhy aren't we able to make our voices heard?
p70
aVWhy can't we make some waves?
p71
aa(lp72
VSo let me ask you a different question:
p73
aVdid any of you buy fair trade coffee
p74
aVthe last time you were at a supermarket or at Starbucks?
p75
aVOK. Do any of you go to the restaurant
p76
aVand order the sustainably farmed trout
p77
aVinstead of the miso-glazed Chilean sea bass
p78
aVthat you really wish you could have?
p79
aVDo any of you drive hybrid cars or even electric cars?
p80
aa(lp81
VSo why do we do these things?
p82
aVRight? One electric car doesn't amount to much in a fleet of 1.2 billion
p83
aVcombustion engine vehicles.
p84
aVOne fish is just one fish in the sea.
p85
aVAnd one cup of coffee
p86
aVdoesn't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.
p87
aVBut we do these things because we believe they matter,
p88
aVthat our actions add up,
p89
aVthat our choices might influence others
p90
aVand collectively, what an impact we can have.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo, in my bag I have a coffee mug that I bought a couple of years ago.
p93
aVIt's a reusable mug. It has all these things printed on it.
p94
aVLook at some of the things that are on it, that it says.
p95
aa(lp96
V"This one cup can be used again and again."
p97
aa(lp98
V"This one cup may inspire others to use one too."
p99
aa(lp100
V"This one cup helps save the planet."
p101
aVI had no idea this plastic cup was so powerful.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VSo why do we think that our choice
p106
aVof a four dollar shade-grown fair trade artisanal cup of coffee
p107
aVin a reusable mug matters,
p108
aVbut what we do with 4,000 dollars in our investment account
p109
aVfor our IRA doesn't?
p110
aVWhy can't we tell the supermarket and the capital markets
p111
aVthat we care,
p112
aVthat we care about fair labor standards,
p113
aVthat we care about sustainable production methods
p114
aVand about healthy communities?
p115
aVWhy aren't we voting with our investment dollars,
p116
aVbut we would vote with our lattes?
p117
aa(lp118
VSo I think it has something to do with the myths,
p119
aVthe fables that we all carry around in our collective consciousness.
p120
aVDo you remember the Grimm's fairy tale about the magic porridge pot?
p121
aVIf you said to the pot, "Boil, little pot, boil,"
p122
aVit would fill up with sweet porridge.
p123
aVAnd if you said, "Stop, little pot, stop,"
p124
aVit would stop.
p125
aVBut if you got the words wrong, it wouldn't listen,
p126
aVand things could go terribly awry.
p127
aVSo I think when it comes to markets,
p128
aVwe have a little bit of a similar fable in our heads.
p129
aVWe believe that the markets is this magic pot
p130
aVthat obeys only one command:
p131
aVmake more money.
p132
aVOnly those words said exactly that way
p133
aVwill make the pot fill up with gold.
p134
aVAdd in some extra words like "protect the environment,"
p135
aVthe spell might not work.
p136
aVPut in the wrong words like "promote social justice,"
p137
aVand you might see your gold coins shrink
p138
aVor even vanish entirely, according to this fable.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo we asked people, what do you really think?
p141
aVAnd we actually went out and polled a thousand individual investors,
p142
aVand we found something fascinating.
p143
aVOverwhelmingly,
p144
aVpeople wanted to add those extra words into the formula.
p145
aV71 percent of people said yes,
p146
aVthey were interested in sustainable investing,
p147
aVwhich we define as taking the best in class investment process
p148
aVthat you already have traditionally
p149
aVand adding in the extra information you get
p150
aVwhen you think about the environment and society and good governance.
p151
aV71 percent wanted that.
p152
aV72 percent said that they believe that companies who did that
p153
aVwould actually do better financially.
p154
aVSo people really do believe that you can do well by doing good.
p155
aVBut here was the weird thing:
p156
aV54 percent of the people
p157
aVstill said if they put their money in those kinds of stocks,
p158
aVthey thought that they would make less money.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo is it true?
p161
aVDo you get less sweet porridge if you invest in shade-grown coffee
p162
aVinstead of drinking it?
p163
aVWell, you know, the investors in companies like Burt's Bees
p164
aVor Ben & Jerry's wouldn't say so.
p165
aVRight? Both of those started out as small, socially conscious companies
p166
aVthat ended up becoming so popular with consumers
p167
aVthat the giants Unilever and Clorox bought them
p168
aVfor hundreds of millions of dollars
p169
aVeach.
p170
aVBut here's the important thing.
p171
aVThose corporations realized
p172
aVthat if they wanted to protect the value of their investments,
p173
aVthey had to preserve that socially conscious mission.
p174
aVIf they didn't keep adding in those extra words
p175
aVof environmentally friendly and socially conscious,
p176
aVthose brands wouldn't make more money.
p177
aa(lp178
VBut maybe this is just the exception the proves the rule, right?
p179
aVThe serious companies that fund our economy
p180
aVand that fund our retirements and that really make the world go round,
p181
aVthey need to stick to making more money.
p182
aVSo, Harvard Business School actually researched this,
p183
aVand they found something fascinating.
p184
aVIf you had invested a dollar 20 years ago
p185
aVin a portfolio of companies
p186
aVthat focused narrowly on making more money
p187
aVquarter by quarter,
p188
aVthat one dollar
p189
aVwould have grown to 14 dollars and 46 cents.
p190
aVThat's not bad until you consider
p191
aVthat if instead you'd invested that same dollar
p192
aVin a portfolio of companies
p193
aVthat focused on growing their business
p194
aVand on the most important environmental and social issues,
p195
aVthat one dollar would have grown
p196
aVto 28 dollars and 36 cents.
p197
aValmost twice as much sweet porridge.
p198
aa(lp199
VNow, let's be clear, they didn't make that outperformance
p200
aVby giving away money to seem like a nice corporate citizen.
p201
aVThey did it by focusing on the things that matter to their business,
p202
aVlike wasting less energy and water
p203
aVin their manufacturing processes;
p204
aVlike making sure the CEO contracts had the CEOs incentivized
p205
aVfor the long-term results of the company and the communities they served,
p206
aVnot just quarterly results;
p207
aVor building a first class culture
p208
aVthat would have higher employee loyalty,
p209
aVretention and productivity.
p210
aVNow, Harvard's not alone.
p211
aVOxford also did a research study where they examined 120 different studies
p212
aVlooking at the effect of sustainability and economic results,
p213
aVand they found time and time and time again
p214
aVthat the companies that cared about these kinds of important things
p215
aVactually had better operational efficiency,
p216
aVlower cost of capital
p217
aVand better performance in their stock price.
p218
aa(lp219
VAnd then there's Al Gore.
p220
aVSo 20 years ago, when I worked for Al Gore in the White House,
p221
aVhe was one of the early pioneers pleading with businesses and governments
p222
aVto pay attention to the challenges of climate change.
p223
aVPost-White House, he opened an investment firm called Generation,
p224
aVwhere he baked environmental sustainability and other things
p225
aVright into the core investment process.
p226
aVAnd at the time there was a good bit of skepticism about his views.
p227
aVTen years later, his track record is one more proof point
p228
aVthat sustainable investing done right can be sound investing.
p229
aVFar from making less sweet porridge
p230
aVbecause he added sustainability into the mix,
p231
aVhe actually significantly outperformed the benchmark.
p232
aa(lp233
VNow, sustainable investing,
p234
aVthe good news is it doesn't require a magic spell
p235
aVand it doesn't require some investment secret,
p236
aVand it's not just for the elite.
p237
aVIt is not just about private equity for billionaires.
p238
aVIt's not just groovy-sounding investments like clean technology
p239
aVor microfinance in emerging markets
p240
aVor artisanal bakeries in Brooklyn.
p241
aVIt's about stocks and bonds and Fortune 500 companies.
p242
aVIt's about mutual funds.
p243
aVIt's about all the things
p244
aVwe already see in the market today.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo here's why I'm convinced
p247
aVthat we collectively have the power
p248
aVto make sustainable investing the new normal.
p249
aa(lp250
VFirst, the proof points are coming out all the time
p251
aVthat sustainable investing done right,
p252
aVpreserving all the same good principles of investing,
p253
aVthe traditional sphere, can pay.
p254
aVIt makes sense.
p255
aa(lp256
VSecondly,
p257
aVthe biggest obstacle standing in our way
p258
aVmay actually just be in our heads.
p259
aVWe just need to let go of that myth
p260
aVthat if you add your values into your investment thinking,
p261
aVthat you get less sweet porridge.
p262
aVAnd once you get rid of the fable,
p263
aVyou can actually start appreciating those facts we've been talking about.
p264
aa(lp265
VAnd third, the future is already here.
p266
aVSustainable investment today is a 20 trillion dollar market
p267
aVand it's the fastest-growing segment of the investment industry.
p268
aVIn the United States, it has grown enormously, as you can see.
p269
aVIt now represents one out of every six dollars
p270
aVunder professional management in the United States.
p271
aa(lp272
VSo what are we waiting for?
p273
aVFor me, it goes back to the inspiration that I received from my mother.
p274
aVShe knew that she wanted a life
p275
aVwhere she would have the freedom to make her own choices
p276
aVand to have her voice heard and write her own story.
p277
aVShe was passionate about that goal
p278
aVand she was clear that she would let no army, no obstacle,
p279
aVno big institution stand in her way.
p280
aVShe made it to the States,
p281
aVand she became a teacher,
p282
aVan award-winning author
p283
aVand a mother,
p284
aVand ended up sending her daughters to Harvard.
p285
aVAnd these days, you can tell that she is amply comfortable
p286
aVholding court in the most powerful institutions in the world.
p287
aVIt seems almost too prophetic
p288
aVthat her name in Korean means
p289
aV"passionate clarity."
p290
aa(lp291
VPassionate clarity:
p292
aVthat's what I think we need to drive change.
p293
aVPassion about the change we want to see in the world,
p294
aVand clarity that we are able to help chart the course.
p295
aVWe have more opportunity today than ever before
p296
aVto make choices.
p297
aVWe have more power than ever before to make our voices heard.
p298
aa(lp299
VSo change your perspective.
p300
aVVote with your small change.
p301
aVInvest in the change you want to see in the world.
p302
aVChange the fables
p303
aVand change the markets.
p304
aa(lp305
VThank you.

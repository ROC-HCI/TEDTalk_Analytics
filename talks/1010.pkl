VI grew up
p5
aVin a very small village in Canada,
p6
aVand I'm an undiagnosed
p7
aVdyslexic.
p8
aVI had a really hard time in school.
p9
aVIn fact, my mother told me eventually
p10
aVthat I was the little kid in the village
p11
aVwho cried all the way to school.
p12
aVI ran away.
p13
aVI left when I was 25 years old to go to Bali,
p14
aVand there I met my incredible wife, Cynthia,
p15
aVand together, over 20 years,
p16
aVwe built an amazing jewelry business.
p17
aVIt was a fairy tale, and then we retired.
p18
aVThen she took me to see a film
p19
aVthat I really didn't want to see.
p20
aVIt ruined my life \u2014
p21
aV(Laughter)
p22
aV"The Inconvenient Truth" and Mr. Gore.
p23
aVI have four kids,
p24
aVand even if part of what he says is true,
p25
aVthey're not going to have the life that I had.
p26
aVAnd I decided at that moment
p27
aVthat I would spend the rest of my life
p28
aVdoing whatever I could
p29
aVto improve their possibilities.
p30
aVSo here's the world,
p31
aVand here we are in Bali.
p32
aVIt's a tiny, little island \u2014
p33
aV60 miles by 90 miles.
p34
aVIt has an intact Hindu culture.
p35
aVCynthia and I were there.
p36
aVWe had had a wonderful life there,
p37
aVand we decided to do something unusual.
p38
aVWe decided to give back
p39
aVlocally.
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd here it is: it's called the Green School.
p42
aVI know it doesn't look like a school,
p43
aVbut it is something we decided to do,
p44
aVand it is extremely,
p45
aVextremely green.
p46
aVThe classrooms have no walls.
p47
aVThe teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard.
p48
aVThe desks are not square.
p49
aVAt Green School, the children are smiling \u2014
p50
aVan unusual thing for school, especially for me.
p51
aVAnd we practice holism.
p52
aVAnd for me it's just the idea
p53
aVthat, if this little girl
p54
aVgraduates as a whole person,
p55
aVchances are
p56
aVshe'll demand a whole world \u2014
p57
aVa whole world \u2014
p58
aVto live on.
p59
aVOur children spend 181 days
p60
aVgoing to school in a box.
p61
aVThe people that built my school
p62
aValso built the prison and the insane asylum
p63
aVout of the same materials.
p64
aVSo if this gentleman
p65
aVhad had a holistic education,
p66
aVwould he be sitting there?
p67
aVWould he have had more possibilities in his life?
p68
aa(lp69
VThe classrooms have natural light.
p70
aVThey're beautiful. They're bamboo.
p71
aVThe breeze passes through them.
p72
aVAnd when the natural breeze isn't enough,
p73
aVthe kids deploy bubbles,
p74
aVbut not the kind of bubbles you know.
p75
aVThese bubbles are made from natural cotton
p76
aVand rubber from the rubber tree.
p77
aVSo we basically turned the box
p78
aVinto a bubble.
p79
aVAnd these kids know
p80
aVthat painless climate control
p81
aVmay not be
p82
aVpart of their future.
p83
aVWe pay the bill at the end of the month,
p84
aVbut the people that are really going to pay the bill
p85
aVare our grandchildren.
p86
aVWe have to teach the kids
p87
aVthat the world is not indestructible.
p88
aVThese kids did a little graffiti on their desks,
p89
aVand then they signed up for two extra courses.
p90
aVThe first one was called sanding
p91
aVand the second one was called re-waxing.
p92
aVBut since that happened,
p93
aVthey own those desks.
p94
aVThey know they can control their world.
p95
aa(lp96
VWe're on the grid. We're not proud of it.
p97
aVBut an amazing alternative energy company in Paris
p98
aVis taking us off the grid with solar.
p99
aVAnd this thing
p100
aVis the second vortex to be built in the world,
p101
aVin a two-and-a-half meter drop on a river.
p102
aVWhen the turbine drops in,
p103
aVit will produce 8,000 watts of electricity,
p104
aVday and night.
p105
aVAnd you know what these are.
p106
aVThere's nowhere to flush.
p107
aVAnd as long as we're taking our waste
p108
aVand mixing it with a huge amount of water \u2014
p109
aVyou're all really smart, just do the math.
p110
aVHow many people times how much water.
p111
aVThere isn't enough water.
p112
aVThese are compost toilets,
p113
aVand nobody at the school wanted to know about them,
p114
aVespecially the principal.
p115
aVAnd they work. People use them. People are okay.
p116
aVIt's something you should think about doing.
p117
aVNot many things didn't work.
p118
aVThe beautiful canvas and rubber skylights
p119
aVgot eaten by the sun in six months.
p120
aVWe had to replace them with recyclable plastic.
p121
aVThe teachers dragged giant PVC whiteboards
p122
aVinto the classrooms.
p123
aVSo we had some good ideas:
p124
aVwe took old automobile windshields, put paper behind them
p125
aVand created the first alternative
p126
aVto the whiteboard.
p127
aa(lp128
VGreen School sits in south-central Bali,
p129
aVand it's on 20 acres
p130
aVof rolling garden.
p131
aVThere's an amazing river traveling through it,
p132
aVand you can see there
p133
aVhow we manage to get across the river.
p134
aVI met a father the other day; he looked a little crazed.
p135
aVI said, "Welcome to Green School."
p136
aVHe said, "I've been on an airplane for 24 hours."
p137
aVI asked him, "Why?"
p138
aVHe said, "I had a dream once about a green school,
p139
aVand I saw a picture of this green school,
p140
aVI got on an airplane.
p141
aVIn August I'm bringing my sons."
p142
aVThis was a great thing.
p143
aVBut more than that,
p144
aVpeople are building green houses around Green School,
p145
aVso their kids can walk to school on the paths.
p146
aVAnd people are bringing their green industries,
p147
aVhopefully their green restaurants,
p148
aVto the Green School.
p149
aVIt's becoming a community.
p150
aVIt's becoming a green model.
p151
aVWe had to look at everything.
p152
aVNo petrochemicals in the pavement.
p153
aVNo pavement.
p154
aVThese are volcanic stones laid by hand.
p155
aVThere are no sidewalks.
p156
aVThe sidewalks are gravel. They flood when it rains,
p157
aVbut they're green.
p158
aa(lp159
VThis is the school buffalo.
p160
aVHe's planning to eat that fence for dinner.
p161
aVAll the fences at Green School are green.
p162
aVAnd when the kindergarten kids
p163
aVrecently moved their gate,
p164
aVthey found out the fence was made out of tapioca.
p165
aVThey took the tapioca roots up to the kitchen,
p166
aVsliced them thinly and made delicious chips.
p167
aVLandscaping.
p168
aVWe manage to keep the garden that was there
p169
aVrunning right up to the edge of each of the classrooms.
p170
aVWe dropped them gently in.
p171
aVWe made space for these guys
p172
aVwho are Bali's last black pigs.
p173
aVAnd the school cow
p174
aVis trying to figure out
p175
aVhow to replace the lawnmower
p176
aVon the playing field.
p177
aa(lp178
VThese young ladies
p179
aVare living in a rice culture,
p180
aVbut they know something that few people know in a rice culture.
p181
aVThey know how to plant organic rice,
p182
aVthey know how to look after it,
p183
aVthey know how to harvest and they know how to cook it.
p184
aVThey're part of the rice cycle
p185
aVand these skills will be valuable
p186
aVfor them in their future.
p187
aVThis young man is picking organic vegetables.
p188
aVWe feed 400 people lunch every day
p189
aVand it's not a normal lunch. There's no gas.
p190
aVLocal Balinese women
p191
aVcook the food on sawdust burners
p192
aVusing secrets that only their grandmothers know.
p193
aVThe food is incredible.
p194
aa(lp195
VGreen School is a place of pioneers,
p196
aVlocal and global.
p197
aVAnd it's a kind of microcosm
p198
aVof the globalized world.
p199
aVThe kids are from 25 countries.
p200
aVWhen I see them together,
p201
aVI know that they're working out
p202
aVhow to live in the future.
p203
aVGreen School is going into its third year
p204
aVwith 160 children.
p205
aVIt's a school where you do learn reading \u2014
p206
aVone of my favorites \u2014
p207
aVwriting \u2014 I was bad at it \u2014
p208
aVarithmetic.
p209
aVBut you also learn other things.
p210
aVYou learn bamboo building.
p211
aVYou practice
p212
aVancient Balinese arts.
p213
aVThis is called mud wrestling in the rice fields.
p214
aVThe kids love it.
p215
aVThe mothers aren't quite convinced.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VWe've done a lot of outrageous things in our lives,
p220
aVand we said, okay, local, what does "local" mean?
p221
aVLocal means
p222
aVthat 20 percent of the population of the school
p223
aVhas to be Balinese,
p224
aVand this was a really big commitment.
p225
aVAnd we were right.
p226
aVAnd people are coming forward
p227
aVfrom all over the world
p228
aVto support the Balinese Scholarship Fund,
p229
aVbecause these kids will be Bali's next green leaders.
p230
aVThe teachers are as diverse
p231
aVas the student body,
p232
aVand the amazing thing
p233
aVis that volunteers are popping up.
p234
aVA man came from Java
p235
aVwith a new kind of organic agriculture.
p236
aVA woman came from Africa with music.
p237
aVAnd together these volunteers and the teachers
p238
aVare deeply committed
p239
aVto creating a new generation
p240
aVof global, green leaders.
p241
aVThe Green School effect \u2014
p242
aVwe don't know what it is.
p243
aVWe need someone to come and study it.
p244
aVBut what's happening, our learning-different kids \u2014
p245
aVdyslexic \u2014
p246
aVwe've renamed them prolexic \u2014
p247
aVare doing well in these beautiful, beautiful classrooms.
p248
aVAnd all the kids are thriving.
p249
aa(lp250
VAnd how did we do all this?
p251
aVOn giant grass.
p252
aVIt's bamboo.
p253
aVIt comes out of the ground like a train.
p254
aVIt grows as high as a coconut tree in two months
p255
aVand three years later it can be harvested
p256
aVto build buildings like this.
p257
aVIt's as strong and dense as teak
p258
aVand it will hold up any roof.
p259
aVWhen the architects came, they brought us these things,
p260
aVand you've probably seen things like this.
p261
aVThe yellow box was called the administration complex.
p262
aV(Laughter)
p263
aVWe squashed it, we rethought it,
p264
aVbut mainly we renamed it
p265
aV"the heart of school,"
p266
aVand that changed everything forever.
p267
aVIt's a double helix.
p268
aVIt has administrators in it
p269
aVand many, many other things.
p270
aa(lp271
VAnd the problem of building it \u2014
p272
aVwhen the Balinese workers
p273
aVsaw long reams of plans,
p274
aVthey looked at them and said, "What's this?"
p275
aVSo we built big models.
p276
aVWe had them engineered by the engineers.
p277
aVAnd Balinese carpenters like this
p278
aVmeasured them with their bamboo rulers,
p279
aVselected the bamboo and built the buildings
p280
aVusing age-old techniques,
p281
aVmostly by hand.
p282
aVIt was chaos.
p283
aVAnd the Balinese carpenters want to be as modern as we do,
p284
aVso they use metal scaffolding
p285
aVto build the bamboo building
p286
aVand when the scaffolding came down,
p287
aVwe realized that we had a cathedral,
p288
aVa cathedral to green,
p289
aVand a cathedral to green education.
p290
aVThe heart of school has seven kilometers
p291
aVof bamboo in it.
p292
aVFrom the time the foundations were finished,
p293
aVin three months it had roofs and floors.
p294
aVIt may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world,
p295
aVbut many people believe
p296
aVthat it's the most beautiful.
p297
aa(lp298
VIs this doable in your community?
p299
aVWe believe it is.
p300
aVGreen School is a model we built for the world.
p301
aVIt's a model we built for Bali.
p302
aVAnd you just have to follow these simple, simple rules:
p303
aVbe local,
p304
aVlet the environment lead
p305
aVand think about
p306
aVhow your grandchildren might build.
p307
aa(lp308
VSo, Mr. Gore, thank you.
p309
aVYou ruined my life,
p310
aVbut you gave me an incredible future.
p311
aVAnd if you're interested in being involved
p312
aVin finishing Green School
p313
aVand building the next 50 around the world,
p314
aVplease come and see us.
p315
aa(lp316
VThank you.

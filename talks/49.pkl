VI'm going to present three projects in rapid fire.
p5
aVI don't have much time to do it.
p6
aVAnd I want to reinforce three ideas with that rapid-fire presentation.
p7
aa(lp8
VThe first is what I like to call a hyper-rational process.
p9
aVIt's a process that takes rationality almost to an absurd level,
p10
aVand it transcends all the baggage
p11
aVthat normally comes with what people would call,
p12
aVsort of a rational conclusion to something.
p13
aVAnd it concludes in something that you see here,
p14
aVthat you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality.
p15
aa(lp16
VThe second \u2014
p17
aVthe second is that this process does not have a signature.
p18
aVThere is no authorship.
p19
aVArchitects are obsessed with authorship.
p20
aVThis is something that has editing and it has teams,
p21
aVbut in fact, we no longer see within this process,
p22
aVthe traditional master architect
p23
aVcreating a sketch that his minions carry out.
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd the third is that it challenges \u2014
p26
aVand this is, in the length of this, very hard to support why,
p27
aVconnect all these things \u2014
p28
aVbut it challenges the high modernist notion of flexibility.
p29
aVHigh modernists said we will create sort of singular spaces that are generic,
p30
aValmost anything can happen within them.
p31
aVI call it sort of "shotgun flexibility" \u2014
p32
aVturn your head this way; shoot; and you're bound to kill something.
p33
aVSo, this is the promise of high modernism:
p34
aVwithin a single space, actually, any kind of activity can happen.
p35
aVBut as we're seeing,
p36
aVoperational costs are starting to dwarf capital costs
p37
aVin terms of design parameters.
p38
aVAnd so, with this sort of idea,
p39
aVwhat happens is, whatever actually is in the building on opening day,
p40
aVor whatever seems to be the most immediate need,
p41
aVstarts to dwarf the possibility and sort of subsume it,
p42
aVof anything else could ever happen.
p43
aVAnd so we're proposing a different kind of flexibility,
p44
aVsomething that we call "compartmentalized flexibility."
p45
aVAnd the idea is that you, within that continuum,
p46
aVidentify a series of points, and you design specifically to them.
p47
aVThey can be pushed off-center a little bit,
p48
aVbut in the end you actually still get as much
p49
aVof that original spectrum as you originally had hoped.
p50
aVWith high modernist flexibility, that doesn't really work.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow I'm going to talk about \u2014
p53
aVI'm going to build up the Seattle Central Library
p54
aVin this way before your eyes in about five or six diagrams,
p55
aVand I truly mean this is the design process that you'll see.
p56
aVWith the library staff and the library board,
p57
aVwe settled on two core positions.
p58
aVThis is the first one, and this is showing, over the last 900 years,
p59
aVthe evolution of the book, and other technologies.
p60
aVThis diagram was our sort of position piece about the book,
p61
aVand our position was, books are technology \u2014
p62
aVthat's something people forget \u2014
p63
aVbut it's a form of technology that will have to share its dominance
p64
aVwith any other form of truly potent technology or media.
p65
aa(lp66
VThe second premise \u2014
p67
aVand this was something that was very difficult for us
p68
aVto convince the librarians of at first \u2014
p69
aVis that libraries, since the inception of Carnegie Library tradition in America,
p70
aVhad a second responsibility, and that was for social roles.
p71
aVOk, now, this I'll come back to later, but something \u2014
p72
aVactually, the librarians at first said, "No, this isn't our mandate.
p73
aVOur mandate is media, and particularly the book."
p74
aa(lp75
VSo what you're seeing now is actually the design of the building.
p76
aVThe upper diagram is what we had seen
p77
aVin a whole host of contemporary libraries that used high modernist flexibility.
p78
aVSort of, any activity could happen anywhere.
p79
aVWe don't know the future of the library; we don't know the future of the book;
p80
aVand so, we'll use this approach.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd what we saw were buildings that were very generic, and worse \u2014
p83
aVnot only were they very generic \u2014
p84
aVso, not only does the reading room look like the copy room
p85
aVlook like the magazine area \u2014
p86
aVbut it meant that whatever issue was troubling the library at that moment
p87
aVwas starting to engulf every other activity that was happening in it.
p88
aVAnd in this case, what was getting engulfed
p89
aVwere these social responsibilities by the expansion of the book.
p90
aVAnd so we proposed what's at the lower diagram.
p91
aVVery dumb approach: simply compartmentalize.
p92
aVPut those things whose evolution we could predict \u2014
p93
aVand I don't mean that we could say what would actually happen in the future,
p94
aVbut we have some certainty of the spectrum of what would happen in the future \u2014
p95
aVput those in boxes designed specifically for it,
p96
aVand put the things that we can't predict on the rooftops.
p97
aVSo that was the core idea.
p98
aa(lp99
VNow, we had to convince the library
p100
aVthat social roles were equally important to media,
p101
aVin order to get them to accept this.
p102
aVWhat you're seeing here is actually their program on the left.
p103
aVThat's as it was given to us in all of its clarity and glory.
p104
aVOur first operation was to re-digest it back to them, show it to them and say,
p105
aV"You know what? We haven't touched it,
p106
aVbut only one-third of your own program is dedicated to media and books.
p107
aVTwo-thirds of it is already dedicated \u2014
p108
aVthat's the white band below, the thing you said isn't important \u2014
p109
aVis already dedicated to social functions."
p110
aVSo once we had presented that back to them,
p111
aVthey agreed that this sort of core concept could work.
p112
aVWe got the right to go back to first principles \u2014
p113
aVthat's the third diagram.
p114
aVWe recombined everything.
p115
aVAnd then we started making new decisions.
p116
aa(lp117
VWhat you're seeing on the right is the design of the library,
p118
aVspecifically in terms of square footage.
p119
aVOn the left of that diagram, here, you'll see a series of five platforms \u2014
p120
aVsort of combs, collective programs.
p121
aVAnd on the right are the more indeterminate spaces;
p122
aVthings like reading rooms,
p123
aVwhose evolution in 20, 30, 40 years we can't predict.
p124
aVSo that literally was the design of the building.
p125
aVThey signed it, and to their chagrin,
p126
aVwe came back a week later, and we presented them this.
p127
aVAnd as you can see, it is literally the diagram on the right.
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VWe just sized \u2014 no, really, I mean that, literally.
p132
aVThe things on the left-hand side of the diagram,
p133
aVthose are the boxes.
p134
aVWe sized them into five compartments. They're super-efficient.
p135
aVWe had a very low budget to work with.
p136
aVWe pushed them around on the site
p137
aVto make very literal contextual relationships.
p138
aVThe reading room should be able to see the water.
p139
aVThe main entrance should have a public plaza in front of it
p140
aVto abide by the zoning code, and so forth.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo, you see the five platforms, those are the boxes.
p143
aVwithin each one, a very discrete thing is happening.
p144
aVThe area in between is sort of an urban continuum,
p145
aVthese things that we can't predict their evolution to the same degree.
p146
aVTo give you some sense of the power of this idea,
p147
aVthe biggest block is what we call the book spiral.
p148
aVIt's literally built in a very inexpensive way \u2014
p149
aVit is a parking garage for books.
p150
aVIt just so happens to be on the 6th through 10th floors of the building,
p151
aVbut that is not necessarily an expensive approach.
p152
aVAnd it allows us to organize the entire Dewey Decimal System
p153
aVon one continuous run; no matter how it grows or contracts within the building,
p154
aVit will always have its clarity to end the sort of trail of tears
p155
aVthat we've all experienced in public libraries.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd so this was the final operation,
p160
aVwhich was to take these blocks as they were all pushed off kilter,
p161
aVand to hold onto them with a skin.
p162
aVThat skin serves double duty, again, for economics.
p163
aVOne, it is the lateral stability for the entire building;
p164
aVit's a structural element.
p165
aVBut its dimensions were designed not only for structure,
p166
aVbut also for holding on every piece of glass.
p167
aVThe glass was then \u2014 I'll use the word impregnated \u2014
p168
aVbut it had a layer of metal that was called "stretched metal."
p169
aVThat metal acts as a microlouver,
p170
aVso from the exterior of the building, the sun sees it as totally opaque,
p171
aVbut from the interior, it's entirely transparent.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo now I'm going to take you on a tour of the building.
p174
aVLet me see if I can find it.
p175
aVFor anyone who gets motion sickness, I apologize.
p176
aVSo, this is the building.
p177
aVAnd I think what's important is, when we first unveiled the building,
p178
aVthe public saw it as being totally about our whim and ego.
p179
aVAnd it was defended, believe it or not, by the librarians.
p180
aVThey said, "Look, we don't know what it is,
p181
aVbut we know it's everything that we need it to be,
p182
aVbased on the observations that we've done about the program."
p183
aVThis is going into one of the entries.
p184
aVSo, it's an unusual building for a public library, obviously.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo now we're going into what we call the living room.
p187
aVThis is actually a program that we invented with the library.
p188
aVIt was recognizing that public libraries
p189
aVare the last vestige of public free space.
p190
aVThere are plenty of shopping malls that allow you to get out of the rain
p191
aVin downtown Seattle,
p192
aVbut there are not so many free places
p193
aVthat allow you to get out of the rain.
p194
aVSo this was an unprogrammed area where people could pretty much do anything,
p195
aVincluding eat, yell, play chess and so forth.
p196
aa(lp197
VNow we're moving up into what we call the mixing chamber.
p198
aVThat was the main technology area in the building.
p199
aVYou'll have to tell me if I'm going too fast for you.
p200
aVAnd now up.
p201
aVThis is actually the place that we put into the building
p202
aVso I could propose to my wife, right there.
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VShe said yes.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VI'm running out of time, so I'm actually going to stop.
p211
aVI can show this to you later.
p212
aVBut let's see if I can very quickly get into the book spiral,
p213
aVbecause I think it's, as I said, the most \u2014
p214
aVthis is the main reading room \u2014 the most unique part of the building.
p215
aVYou dizzy yet?
p216
aVOk, so here, this is the book spiral.
p217
aVSo, it's very indiscernible,
p218
aVbut it's actually a continuous stair-stepping.
p219
aVIt allows you to, on one city block,
p220
aVgo up one full floor, so that it's on a continuum.
p221
aa(lp222
VOk, now I'm going to go back, and I'm going to hit a second project.
p223
aVI'm going to go very, very quickly through this.
p224
aVNow this is the Dallas Theater.
p225
aVIt was an unusual client for us, because they came to us and they said,
p226
aV"We need you to do a new building.
p227
aVWe've been working in a temporary space for 30 years,
p228
aVbut because of that temporary space,
p229
aVwe've become an infamous theater company.
p230
aVTheater is really focused in New York, Chicago and Seattle,
p231
aVwith the exception of the Dallas Theater Company."
p232
aVAnd the very fact that they worked in a provisional space
p233
aVmeant that for Beckett, they could blow out a wall;
p234
aVthey could do "Cherry Orchard" and blow a hole through the floor, and so forth.
p235
aa(lp236
VSo it was a very daunting task for us to do a brand-new building
p237
aVthat could be a pristine building,
p238
aVbut keep this kind of experimental nature.
p239
aVAnd the second is,
p240
aVthey were what we call a multi-form theater,
p241
aVthey do different kinds of performances in repertory.
p242
aVSo they in the morning will do something in arena,
p243
aVthen they'll do something in proscenium and so forth.
p244
aVAnd so they needed to be able to quickly transform
p245
aVbetween different theater organizations,
p246
aVand for operational budget reasons,
p247
aVthis actually no longer happens in pretty much
p248
aVany multi-form theater in the United States,
p249
aVso we needed to figure out a way to overcome that.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo our thought was to literally put the theater on its head:
p252
aVto take those things that were previously defined
p253
aVas front-of-house and back-of-house
p254
aVand stack them above house and below house,
p255
aVand to create what we called a theater machine.
p256
aVWe invest the money in the operation of the building.
p257
aVIt's almost as though the building could be placed anywhere,
p258
aVwherever you place it,
p259
aVthe area under it is charged for theatrical performances.
p260
aVAnd it allowed us to go back to first principles,
p261
aVand redefine fly tower, acoustic enclosure, light enclosure and so forth.
p262
aVAnd at the push of a button,
p263
aVit allows the artistic director to move between proscenium, thrust,
p264
aVand in fact, arena and traverse and flat floor,
p265
aVin a very quick transfiguration.
p266
aa(lp267
VSo in fact, using operational budget, we can \u2014
p268
aVsorry, capital cost \u2014 we can actually achieve
p269
aVwhat was no longer achievable in operational cost.
p270
aVAnd that means that the artistic director
p271
aVnow has a palette that he or she can choose from,
p272
aVbetween a series of forms and a series of processions,
p273
aVbecause that enclosure around the theater that is normally trapped
p274
aVwith front-of-house and back-of-house spaces has been liberated.
p275
aVSo an artistic director has the ability to have a performance
p276
aVthat enters in a Wagnerian procession,
p277
aVshows the first act in thrust,
p278
aVthe intermission in a Greek procession,
p279
aVsecond act in arena, and so forth.
p280
aa(lp281
VSo I'm going to show you what this actually means.
p282
aVThis is the theater up close.
p283
aVAny portion around the theater actually can be opened discretely.
p284
aVThe light enclosure can be lifted separate to the acoustic enclosure,
p285
aVso you can do Beckett with Dallas as the backdrop.
p286
aVPortions can be opened,
p287
aVso you can now actually have motorcycles drive directly into the performance,
p288
aVor you can even just have an open-air performance,
p289
aVor for intermissions.
p290
aVThe balconies all move to go between those configurations,
p291
aVbut they also disappear.
p292
aVThe proscenium line can also disappear.
p293
aVYou can bring enormous objects in,
p294
aVso in fact, the Dallas Theater Company \u2014
p295
aVtheir first show will be a play about Charles Lindbergh,
p296
aVand they'll want to bring in a real aircraft.
p297
aVAnd then it also provides them, in the off-season,
p298
aVthe ability to actually rent out their space for entirely different things.
p299
aVThis is it from a distance.
p300
aVOpen up entire portions for different kinds of events.
p301
aVAnd at night.
p302
aVAgain, remove the light enclosure; keep the acoustic enclosure.
p303
aVThis is a monster truck show.
p304
aa(lp305
VI'm going to show now the last project.
p306
aVThis also is an unusual client.
p307
aVThey inverted the whole idea of development.
p308
aVThey came to us and they said \u2014 unlike normal developers \u2014
p309
aVthey said, "We want to start out
p310
aVby providing a contemporary art museum in Louisville.
p311
aVThat's our main goal."
p312
aVAnd so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money,
p313
aVthey saw an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown.
p314
aVAnd the fact that they wanted to support the contemporary art museum
p315
aVactually built their pro forma,
p316
aVso they worked in reverse.
p317
aVAnd that pro forma led us
p318
aVto a mixed-use building that was very large,
p319
aVin order to support their aspirations of the art,
p320
aVbut it also opened up opportunities for the art itself
p321
aVto collaborate, interact with commercial spaces
p322
aVthat actually artists more and more want to work within.
p323
aVAnd it also charged us with thinking about how to have
p324
aVsomething that was both a single building
p325
aVand a credible sort of sub-building.
p326
aa(lp327
VSo this is Louisville's skyline,
p328
aVand I'm going to take you through the various constraints
p329
aVthat led to the project.
p330
aVFirst: the physical constraints.
p331
aVWe actually had to operate on three discrete sites,
p332
aVall of them well smaller than the size of the building.
p333
aVWe had to operate next to the new Muhammad Ali Center, and respect it.
p334
aVWe had to operate within the 100-year floodplain.
p335
aVNow, this area floods three to four times a year,
p336
aVand there's a levee behind our site,
p337
aVsimilar to the ones that broke in New Orleans.
p338
aVHad to operate behind the I-64 corridor,
p339
aVa street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites.
p340
aVSo we're starting to build a sort of nightmare of constraints in a bathtub.
p341
aVUnderneath the bathtub are the city's main power lines.
p342
aVAnd there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add,
p343
aVthat would link a series of cultural buildings,
p344
aVand a view corridor \u2014 because this is the historic district \u2014
p345
aVthat they didn't want to obstruct with a new building.
p346
aa(lp347
V(Laughter)
p348
aa(lp349
VAnd now we're going to add 1.1 million square feet.
p350
aVAnd if we did the traditional thing, that 1.1 million square feet \u2014
p351
aVthese are the different programs \u2014
p352
aVthe traditional thing would be to identify the public elements, place them on sites,
p353
aVand now we'd have a really terrible situation:
p354
aVa public thing in the middle of a bathtub that floods.
p355
aVAnd then we would size all the other elements \u2014
p356
aVthe different commercial elements:
p357
aVhotel, luxury housing, offices and so forth \u2014
p358
aVand dump it on top.
p359
aVAnd we would create something that was unviable.
p360
aVIn fact \u2014 and you know this \u2014 this is called the Time Warner Building.
p361
aa(lp362
V(Laughter)
p363
aa(lp364
VSo our strategy was very simple.
p365
aVJust lift the entire block,
p366
aVflip some of the elements over,
p367
aVreposition them so they have appropriate views
p368
aVand relationships to downtown,
p369
aVand make circulation connections and reroute the road.
p370
aVSo that's the basic concept,
p371
aVand now I'm going to show you what it leads to.
p372
aa(lp373
VOk, it seems a very formal, willful gesture,
p374
aVbut something derived entirely out of the constraints.
p375
aVAnd again, when we unveiled it, there was a sort of nervousness
p376
aVthat this was about an architect making a statement,
p377
aVnot an architect who was attempting to solve a series of problems.
p378
aVNow, within that center zone, as I said,
p379
aVwe have the ability to mix a series of things.
p380
aVSo here, this is sort of an x-ray \u2014
p381
aVthe towers are totally developer-driven.
p382
aVThey told us the dimensions, the sizes and so forth,
p383
aVand we focused on taking all the public components \u2014
p384
aVthe lobbies, the bars \u2014
p385
aVeverything that different commercial elements would have,
p386
aVand combined it in the center, in the sort of subway map,
p387
aVin the transfer zone that would also include the contemporary art museum.
p388
aa(lp389
VSo it creates a situation like this, where you have artists who can operate
p390
aVwithin an art space that also has an amazing view on the 22nd floor,
p391
aVbut it also has proximity that the curator can either open or close.
p392
aVIt allows people on exercise bicycles to be seen,
p393
aVor to see the art, and so forth.
p394
aVIt also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool,
p395
aVthey can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool,
p396
aVso they're not forced to always work within the confines
p397
aVof a contemporary gallery space.
p398
aa(lp399
VSo, how to build this.
p400
aVIt's very simple: it's a chair.
p401
aVSo, we begin by building the cores.
p402
aVAs we're building the cores, we build the contemporary art museum at grade.
p403
aVThat allows us to have incredible efficiency and cost efficiency.
p404
aVThis is not a high-budget building.
p405
aVThe moment the cores get to mid level,
p406
aVwe finish the art museum; we put all the mechanical equipment in it;
p407
aVand then we jack it up into the air.
p408
aVThis is how they build really large aircraft hangars,
p409
aVfor instance, the ones that they did for the A380.
p410
aVFinish the cores, finish the meat
p411
aVand you get something that looks like this.
p412
aa(lp413
VNow I only have about 30 seconds,
p414
aVso I want to start an animation,
p415
aVand we'll conclude with that.
p416
aa(lp417
VThank you.
p418
aa(lp419
V(Applause)
p420
aa(lp421
VChris asked me to add \u2014

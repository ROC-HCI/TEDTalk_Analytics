VAbout 15 years ago, I went to visit a friend in Hong Kong.
p5
aVAnd at the time I was very superstitious.
p6
aVSo, upon landing \u2014 this was still at the old Hong Kong airport
p7
aVthat's Kai Tak, when it was smack in the middle of the city \u2014
p8
aVI thought, "If I see something good, I'm going to have a great time here in
p9
aVmy two weeks. And if I see something negative, I'm going to be miserable, indeed."
p10
aa(lp11
VSo the plane landed in between the buildings
p12
aVand got to a full stop in front of this little billboard.
p13
aV(Laughter)
p14
aVAnd I actually went to see some of the design companies
p15
aVin Hong Kong in my stay there.
p16
aVAnd it turned out that \u2014
p17
aVI just went to see, you know, what they are doing in Hong Kong.
p18
aa(lp19
VBut I actually walked away with a great job offer.
p20
aVAnd I flew back to Austria, packed my bags,
p21
aVand, another week later, I was again on my way to Hong Kong
p22
aVstill superstitions and thinking, "Well, if that 'Winner' billboard is still up,
p23
aVI'm going to have a good time working here.
p24
aV(Laughter)
p25
aVBut if it's gone, it's going to be really miserable and stressful."
p26
aVSo it turned out that not only was the billboard still up
p27
aVbut they had put this one right next to it.
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aVOn the other hand, it also taught me where superstition gets me
p30
aVbecause I really had a terrible time in Hong Kong.
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VHowever, I did have a number of real moments of happiness in my life \u2014
p34
aVof, you know, I think what the conference brochure refers to
p35
aVas "moments that take your breath away."
p36
aVAnd since I'm a big list maker, I actually listed them all.
p37
aV(Laughter)
p38
aVNow, you don't have to go through the trouble of reading them
p39
aVand I won't read them for you.
p40
aVI know that it's incredibly boring to hear about other people's happinesses.
p41
aV(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VWhat I did do, though is, I actually looked at them from a design standpoint
p44
aVand just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design.
p45
aVAnd, very surprisingly, over half of them had, actually, something to do with design.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo there are, of course, two different possibilities.
p48
aVThere's one from a consumer's point of view \u2014
p49
aVwhere I was happy while experiencing design.
p50
aVAnd I'll just give you one example. I had gotten my first Walkman.
p51
aVThis is 1983.
p52
aVMy brother had this great Yamaha motorcycle
p53
aVthat he was willing to borrow to me freely.
p54
aVAnd The Police's "Synchronicity"
p55
aVcassette had just been released
p56
aVand there was no helmet law in my hometown of Bregenz.
p57
aVSo you could drive up into the mountains
p58
aVfreely blasting The Police on the new Sony Walkman.
p59
aV(Laughter)
p60
aVAnd I remember it as a true moment of happiness.
p61
aVYou know, of course, they are related to this combination of
p62
aVat least two of them being, you know, design objects.
p63
aVAnd, you know, there's a scale of happiness when you talk about in design
p64
aVbut the motorcycle incident would definitely be, you know,
p65
aVsituated somewhere here \u2014 right in there between Delight and Bliss.
p66
aa(lp67
VNow, there is the other part, from a designer's standpoint \u2014
p68
aVif you're happy while actually doing it.
p69
aVAnd one way to see how happy designers are when they're designing could be to
p70
aVlook at the authors' photos on the back of their monographs?
p71
aV(Laughter)
p72
aVSo, according to this, the Australians and the Japanese
p73
aVas well as the Mexicans
p74
aVare very happy.
p75
aV(Laughter)
p76
aVWhile, somewhat, the Spaniards ...
p77
aVand, I think, particularly, the Swiss
p78
aV(Laughter),
p79
aVdon't seem to be doing all that well.
p80
aV(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VLast November, a museum opened in Tokyo called The Mori Museum,
p83
aVin a skyscraper, up on the 56th floor.
p84
aVAnd their inaugural exhibit was called "Happiness."
p85
aVAnd I went, very eagerly, to see it, because \u2014
p86
aVwell, also, with an eye on this conference.
p87
aVAnd they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different areas.
p88
aVUnder "Arcadia," they showed things like this, from the Edo period \u2014
p89
aVa hundred ways to write "happiness" in different forms.
p90
aVOr they had this apple by Yoko Ono \u2014 that, of course, later on
p91
aVwas, you know, made into the label for The Beatles.
p92
aa(lp93
VUnder "Nirvana" they showed this Constable painting.
p94
aVAnd there was a little \u2014 an interesting theory about abstraction.
p95
aVThis is a blue field \u2014 it's actually an Yves Klein painting.
p96
aVAnd the theory was that if you abstract an image, you really, you know
p97
aVopen as much room for the un-representable \u2014
p98
aVand, therefore, you know, are able to involve the viewer more.
p99
aa(lp100
VThen, under "Desire," they showed these Shunsho paintings \u2014
p101
aValso from the Edo period \u2014 ink on silk.
p102
aVAnd, lastly, under "Harmony," they had this 13th-century mandala from Tibet.
p103
aa(lp104
VNow, what I took away from the exhibit was that
p105
aVmaybe with the exception of the mandala
p106
aVmost of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness
p107
aVand not about happiness.
p108
aVAnd I felt a little bit cheated, because the visualization \u2014
p109
aVthat's a really easy thing to do.
p110
aVAnd, you know, my studio \u2014 we've done it all the time.
p111
aVThis is, you know, a book.
p112
aVA happy dog \u2014 and you take it out, it's an aggressive dog.
p113
aVIt's a happy David Byrne and an angry David Byrne.
p114
aVOr a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face.
p115
aVYou know, that's not a big deal to accomplish.
p116
aa(lp117
VIt has gotten to the point where, you know, within advertising
p118
aVor within the movie industry, "happy" has gotten such a bad reputation that
p119
aVif you actually want to do something with the subject
p120
aVand still appear authentic, you almost would have to, you know,
p121
aVdo it from a cynical point of view.
p122
aVThis is, you know, the movie poster.
p123
aVOr we, a couple of weeks ago, designed a box set for The Talking Heads
p124
aVwhere the happiness visualized on the cover definitely has, very much, a dark side to it.
p125
aa(lp126
VMuch, much more difficult is this, where the designs actually can evoke happiness \u2014
p127
aVand I'm going to just show you three that actually did this for me.
p128
aVThis is a campaign done by a young artist in New York, who calls himself "True."
p129
aVEverybody who has ridden the New York subway system will be
p130
aVfamiliar with these signs?
p131
aVTrue printed his own version of these signs.
p132
aVMet every Wednesday at a subway stop with 20 of his friends.
p133
aVThey divided up the different subway lines and added their own version.
p134
aV(Laughter)
p135
aVSo this is one.
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
VNow, the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs.
p139
aVSo you're
p140
aV(Laughter)
p141
aVyou're really bored in the subway, and you kind of stare at something.
p142
aVAnd it takes you a while until it actually \u2014
p143
aVyou realize that this says something different than what it normally says.
p144
aV(Laughter)
p145
aVI mean, that's, at least, how it made me happy.
p146
aV(Laughter)
p147
aa(lp148
VNow, True is a real humanitarian.
p149
aVHe didn't want any of his friends to be arrested,
p150
aVso he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card.
p151
aV(Laughter)
p152
aVAnd also gave this fake letter from the MTA to everybody \u2014
p153
aVsort of like pretending that it's an art project
p154
aVfinanced by The Metropolitan Transit Authority.
p155
aV(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VAnother New York project.
p158
aVThis is at P.S. 1 \u2014 a sculpture that's basically a square room
p159
aVby James Turrell, that has a retractable ceiling.
p160
aVOpens up at dusk and dawn every day.
p161
aVYou don't see the horizon.
p162
aVYou're just in there, watching the incredible, subtle changes of color in the sky.
p163
aVAnd the room is truly something to be seen.
p164
aVPeople's demeanor changes when they go in there.
p165
aVAnd, for sure, I haven't looked at the sky in the same way
p166
aVafter spending an hour in there.
p167
aa(lp168
VThere are, of course, more than those three projects that I'm showing here.
p169
aVI would definitely say that observing Vik Muniz' "Cloud"
p170
aVa couple of years ago in Manhattan for sure made me happy, as well.
p171
aVBut my last project is, again, from a young designer in New York.
p172
aVHe's from Korea originally.
p173
aVAnd he took it upon himself to print 55,000 speech bubbles \u2014
p174
aVempty speech bubbles stickers, large ones and small ones.
p175
aVAnd he goes around New York and just puts them, empty as they are, on posters.
p176
aV(Laughter)
p177
aVAnd other people go and fill them in.
p178
aV(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VThis one says, "Please let me die in peace."
p181
aV(Laughter)
p182
aVI think that was \u2014
p183
aVthe most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good.
p184
aVThis is on a musician poster, that says:
p185
aV"I am concerned that my CD will not sell more than 200,000 units
p186
aVand that, as a result, my recoupable advance
p187
aVfrom my label will be taken from me,
p188
aVafter which, my contract will be cancelled,
p189
aVand I'll be back doing Journey covers on Bleecker Street."
p190
aV(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
VI think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins.
p193
aVJee gets to have his project;
p194
aVthe public gets a sweeter environment;
p195
aVand different public gets a place to express itself;
p196
aVand the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads.
p197
aV(Laughter)
p198
aa(lp199
VWell, there was a question, of course, that was on my mind for a while:
p200
aVYou know, can I do more of the things that I like doing in design
p201
aVand less of the ones that I don't like to be doing?
p202
aVWhich brought me back to my list making \u2014
p203
aVyou know, just to see what I actually like about my job.
p204
aa(lp205
VYou know, one is: just working without pressure.
p206
aVThen: working concentrated, without being frazzled.
p207
aVOr, as Nancy said before, like really immerse oneself into it.
p208
aVTry not to get stuck doing the same thing \u2014
p209
aVor try not get stuck behind the computer all day.
p210
aVThis is, you know, related to it: getting out of the studio.
p211
aVThen, of course, trying to, you know, work on things
p212
aVwhere the content is actually important for me.
p213
aVAnd being able to enjoy the end results.
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd then I found another list in one of my diaries that actually contained
p216
aVall the things that I thought I learned in my life so far.
p217
aVAnd, just about at that time, an Austrian magazine called and asked
p218
aVif we would want to do six spreads \u2014 design six spreads
p219
aVthat work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine?
p220
aVAnd the whole thing just fell together.
p221
aVSo I just picked one of the things that I thought I learned \u2014
p222
aVin this case, "Everything I do always comes back to me" \u2014
p223
aVand we made these spreads right out of this.
p224
aVSo it was: "Everything
p225
aVI do
p226
aValways
p227
aVcomes
p228
aVback
p229
aVto me."
p230
aa(lp231
VA couple of weeks ago, a
p232
aV(Laughter)
p233
aVFrench company asked us to design five billboards for them.
p234
aVAgain, we could supply the content for it.
p235
aVSo I just picked another one.
p236
aVAnd this was two weeks ago.
p237
aVWe flew to Arizona \u2014 the designer who works with me, and myself \u2014
p238
aVand photographed this one.
p239
aVSo it's: "Trying
p240
aVto look
p241
aVgood
p242
aVlimits
p243
aVmy life."
p244
aa(lp245
VAnd then we did one more of these.
p246
aVThis is, again, for a magazine, dividing pages.
p247
aVThis is: "Having" \u2014
p248
aVthis is the same thing;
p249
aVit's just, you know, photographed from the side.
p250
aVThis is from the front.
p251
aVThen it's: "guts."
p252
aVAgain, it's the same thing \u2014 "guts" is just the same room, reworked.
p253
aVThen it's: "always
p254
aVworks out."
p255
aVThen it's "for," with the light on.
p256
aV(Laughter)
p257
aVAnd it's "me."
p258
aa(lp259
VThank you so much.
p260
aV(Applause)

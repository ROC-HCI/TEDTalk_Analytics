VThere's this quote by activist and punk rock musician Jello Biafra that I love.
p5
aVHe says, "Don't hate the media. Be the media."
p6
aVI'm an artist.
p7
aVI like working with media and technology because A, I'm familiar with them
p8
aVand I like the power they hold.
p9
aVAnd B, I hate them and I'm terrified of the power they hold.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VI remember watching, in 2003, an interview between Fox News host Tony Snow
p14
aVand then-US Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld.
p15
aVThey were talking about the recent invasion of Iraq,
p16
aVand Rumsfeld is asked the question,
p17
aV"Well, we're hear about our body counts,
p18
aVbut we never hear about theirs, why?"
p19
aVAnd Rumsfeld's answer is,
p20
aV"Well, we don't do body counts on other people."
p21
aVRight?
p22
aa(lp23
VIt's estimated that between 150,000 to one million Iraqis, civilians,
p24
aVhave died as a result of the US-led invasion in 2003.
p25
aVThat number is in stark contrast with the 4,486 US service members who died
p26
aVduring that same window of time.
p27
aVI wanted to do more than just bring awareness to this terrifying number.
p28
aVI wanted to create a monument for the individual civilians
p29
aVwho died as a result of the invasion.
p30
aa(lp31
VMonuments to war, such as Maya Lin's Vietnam Memorial,
p32
aVare often enormous in scale.
p33
aVVery powerful and very one-sided.
p34
aVI wanted my monument to live in the world, and to circulate.
p35
aVI remember when I was a boy in school,
p36
aVmy teacher assigned us this classic civics assignment
p37
aVwhere you take a sheet of paper and you write a member of your government.
p38
aVAnd we were told, if we wrote a really good letter,
p39
aVif we really thought about it,
p40
aVwe would get back more than just a simple formed letter as a reply.
p41
aa(lp42
VThis is my "Notepad."
p43
aVWhat looks like an everyday, yellow legal tablet of paper
p44
aVis actually a monument to the individual Iraqi civilians
p45
aVthat died as a result of the US invasion.
p46
aV"Notepad" is an act of protest and an act of commemoration
p47
aVdisguised as an everyday tablet of paper.
p48
aVThe lines of the paper, when magnified,
p49
aVare revealed to be micro-printed text
p50
aVthat contains the details, the names, the dates and locations
p51
aVof individual Iraqi civilians that died.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo, for the last 5 years, I've been taking pads of this paper, tons of this stuff,
p54
aVand smuggling it into the stationery supplies
p55
aVof the United States and the Coalition governments.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
V(Applause)
p60
aa(lp61
VI don't have to tell you guys this is not the place to discuss how I did that.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VBut also, I've been meeting one-on-one with members and former members
p66
aVof the so-called Coalition of the Willing, who assisted in the invasion.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd so, whenever I can, I meet with one of them,
p69
aVand I share the project with them.
p70
aVAnd last summer, I had the chance to meet
p71
aVwith former United States Attorney General and Torture Memo author, Alberto Gonzales.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Video) Matt Kenyon: May I give this to you?
p74
aVThis is a special legal tablet.
p75
aVIt's actually part of an ongoing art project.
p76
aa(lp77
VAlberto Gonzalez: This is a special legal pad?
p78
aa(lp79
VMK: Yes. You won't believe me,
p80
aVbut it's in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art; I'm an artist.
p81
aa(lp82
VMK: And all of the lines of the paper are actually \u2014
p83
aa(lp84
VAG: Are they going to disappear?
p85
aa(lp86
VMK: No, they're micro-printed text
p87
aVthat contains the names of individual Iraqi civilians
p88
aVwho have died since the invasion of Iraq.
p89
aa(lp90
VAG: Yeah. OK.
p91
aa(lp92
VAG: Thank you. MK: Thank you.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VThe way he says "thank you" really creeps me out.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VOK, so I'd like each of you to look under your chairs.
p101
aVThere's an envelope.
p102
aVAnd please open it.
p103
aVThe paper you're holding in your hand
p104
aVcontains the details of Iraqi civilians that died as result of the invasion.
p105
aVI'd like you to use this paper and write a member of government.
p106
aVYou can help to smuggle this civilian body count
p107
aVinto government archives.
p108
aVBecause every letter that's sent in to the government,
p109
aVand this is all across the world, of course \u2014
p110
aVevery letter that is sent in is archived, filed and recorded.
p111
aVTogether, we can put this in the mailboxes and under the noses of people in power.
p112
aVEverything that's sent in
p113
aVeventually becomes part of the permanent archive of our government,
p114
aVour shared historical record.
p115
aa(lp116
VThank you.
p117
aa(lp118
V(Applause)
p119
aa(lp120
VTom Rielly: So, tell me Matt,
p121
aVhow did this idea come into your head, of "Notepad"?
p122
aa(lp123
VMatt Kenyon: I'd just finished a project
p124
aVthat dealt with the US Coalition side of the war
p125
aVand it was a black armband that was called the "Improvised Empathetic Device"
p126
aVwhich accumulated, in real time,
p127
aVthe names, ranks, cause of death and location
p128
aVof US service members who had died overseas,
p129
aVand each time the Department of Defense or CENTCOM released their data,
p130
aVit would stab me in the arm.
p131
aVAnd so, I became aware that there was a spectacle
p132
aVassociated with our own people who were dying overseas,
p133
aVbut a disproportionate amount of casualties
p134
aVwere the civilian casualties.
p135
aa(lp136
VTR: Thank you so much.
p137
aa(lp138
VMK: Thank you.

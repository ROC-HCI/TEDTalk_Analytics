VThese rocks have been hitting our earth for about three billion years,
p5
aVand are responsible for much of what\u2019s gone on on our planet.
p6
aVThis is an example of a real meteorite,
p7
aVand you can see all the melting of the iron
p8
aVfrom the speed and the heat when a meteorite hits the earth,
p9
aVand just how much of it survives and melts.
p10
aVFrom a meteorite from space,
p11
aVwe\u2019re over here with an original Sputnik.
p12
aVThis is one of the seven surviving Sputniks that was not launched into space.
p13
aVThis is not a copy.
p14
aVThe space age began 50 years ago in October,
p15
aVand that\u2019s exactly what Sputnik looked like.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd it wouldn\u2019t be fun to talk about the space age
p18
aVwithout seeing a flag that was carried
p19
aVto the moon and back, on Apollo 11.
p20
aVThe astronauts each got to carry
p21
aVabout ten silk flags in their personal kits.
p22
aVThey would bring them back and mount them.
p23
aVSo this has actually been carried to the moon
p24
aVand back.
p25
aVSo that\u2019s for fun.
p26
aa(lp27
VThe dawn of books is, of course, important.
p28
aVAnd it wouldn\u2019t be interesting to talk about the dawn of books
p29
aVwithout having a copy of a Guttenberg Bible.
p30
aVYou can see how portable and handy it was to have your own Guttenberg
p31
aVin 1455.
p32
aVBut what\u2019s interesting about the Guttenberg Bible, and the dawn of this technology,
p33
aVis not the book.
p34
aVYou see, the book was not driven by reading.
p35
aVIn 1455, nobody could read.
p36
aVSo why did the printing press succeed?
p37
aVThis is an original page of a Guttenberg Bible.
p38
aVSo you\u2019re looking here at one of the first printed books
p39
aVusing movable type in the history of man,
p40
aV550 years ago.
p41
aVWe are living at the age here at the end of the book,
p42
aVwhere electronic paper will undoubtedly replace it.
p43
aa(lp44
VBut why is this so interesting? Here\u2019s the quick story.
p45
aVIt turns out that in the 1450s,
p46
aVthe Catholic Church needed money,
p47
aVand so they
p48
aVactually hand-wrote these things called indulgences,
p49
aVwhich were forgiveness\u2019s on pieces of paper.
p50
aVThey traveled all around Europe
p51
aVand sold by the hundreds or by the thousands.
p52
aVThey got you out of purgatory faster.
p53
aVAnd when the printing press was invented
p54
aVwhat they found was they could print indulgences,
p55
aVwhich was the equivalent of printing money.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd so all of Western Europe started buying printing presses in 1455 \u2014
p58
aVto print out thousands,
p59
aVand then hundreds of thousands,
p60
aVand then ultimately millions
p61
aVof single, small pieces of paper
p62
aVthat got you out of middle hell and into heaven.
p63
aVThat is why the printing press succeeded,
p64
aVand that is why Martin Luther
p65
aVnailed his 90 theses to the door:
p66
aVbecause he was complaining that the Catholic Church had gone amok
p67
aVin printing out indulgences and selling them
p68
aVin every town and village and city in all of Western Europe.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo the printing press, ladies and gentlemen,
p71
aVwas driven entirely by the printing of forgivenesses
p72
aVand had nothing to do with reading.
p73
aVMore tomorrow. I also have pictures coming of the library
p74
aVfor those of you that have asked for pictures.
p75
aVWe\u2019re going to have some tomorrow.
p76
aV(Applause)
p77
aa(lp78
VInstead of showing an object from the stage
p79
aVI\u2019m going to do something special for the first time.
p80
aVWe are going to show, actually, what the library looks like, OK?
p81
aVSo, I am married to the most wonderful woman in the world.
p82
aVYou\u2019re going to find out why in a minute,
p83
aVbecause when I went to see Eileen,
p84
aVthis is what I said I wanted to build.
p85
aa(lp86
VThis is the Library of Human Imagination.
p87
aVThe room itself is three stories tall.
p88
aVIn the glass panels are 5,000 years of human imagination
p89
aVthat are computer controlled.
p90
aVThe room is a theatre. It changes colors.
p91
aVAnd all throughout the library are different objects, different spaces.
p92
aVIt\u2019s designed like an Escher print.
p93
aVHere is some of the lower level of the library,
p94
aVwhere the exhibits constantly change.
p95
aVYou can walk through. You can touch.
p96
aVYou can see exactly how many of these types of items would fit in a room.
p97
aVThere\u2019s my very own Saturn V.
p98
aVEverybody should have one, OK? (Laughter)
p99
aVSo you can see here in the lower level of the library
p100
aVthe books and the objects.
p101
aVIn the glass panels all along is sort of the history of imagination.
p102
aVThere is a glass bridge that you walk across
p103
aVthat\u2019s suspended in space.
p104
aVSo it\u2019s a leap of imagination.
p105
aa(lp106
VHow do we create?
p107
aVPart of the question that I have answered is,
p108
aVis we create by surrounding ourselves with stimuli:
p109
aVwith human achievement, with history,
p110
aVwith the things that drive us and make us human \u2014
p111
aVthe passionate discovery, the bones of dinosaurs long gone,
p112
aVthe maps of space that we\u2019ve experienced,
p113
aVand ultimately the hallways that stimulate our mind and our imagination.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo hopefully tomorrow I\u2019ll show
p116
aVone or two more objects from the stage,
p117
aVbut for today I just wanted to say thank you
p118
aVfor all the people that came and talked to us about it.
p119
aVAnd Eileen and I are thrilled to open our home
p120
aVand share it with the TED community.
p121
aV(Applause)
p122
aVTED is all about patterns in the clouds.
p123
aVIt\u2019s all about connections.
p124
aVIt\u2019s all about seeing things
p125
aVthat everybody else has seen before
p126
aVbut thinking about them in ways that nobody has thought of them before.
p127
aVAnd that\u2019s really what discovery and imagination is all about.
p128
aa(lp129
VFor example, we can look
p130
aVat a DNA molecule model here.
p131
aVNone of us really have ever seen one,
p132
aVbut we know it exists because we\u2019ve been taught
p133
aVto understand this molecule.
p134
aVBut we can also look at an Enigma machine
p135
aVfrom the Nazis in World War II
p136
aVthat was a coding and decoding machine.
p137
aVNow, you might say, what does this have to do with this?
p138
aVWell, this is the code for life,
p139
aVand this is a code for death.
p140
aVThese two molecules
p141
aVcode and decode.
p142
aVAnd yet, looking at them, you would see a machine and a molecule.
p143
aVBut once you\u2019ve seen them in a new way,
p144
aVyou realize that both of these things really are connected.
p145
aVAnd they\u2019re connected primarily because of this here.
p146
aa(lp147
VYou see, this is a human brain model, OK?
p148
aVAnd it\u2019s rare, because we never really get to see a brain.
p149
aVWe get to see a skull. But there it is.
p150
aVAll of imagination \u2014 everything that we think,
p151
aVwe feel, we sense \u2014 comes through the human brain.
p152
aVAnd once we create new patterns in this brain,
p153
aVonce we shape the brain in a new way,
p154
aVit never returns to its original shape.
p155
aa(lp156
VAnd I\u2019ll give you a quick example.
p157
aVWe think about the Internet;
p158
aVwe think about information that goes across the Internet.
p159
aVAnd we never think about the hidden connection.
p160
aVBut I brought along here a lump of coal \u2014
p161
aVright here, one lump of coal.
p162
aVAnd what does a lump of coal have to do with the Internet?
p163
aVYou see, it takes the energy in one lump of coal
p164
aVto move one megabyte of information across the net.
p165
aVSo every time you download a file,
p166
aVeach megabyte is a lump of coal.
p167
aVWhat that means is, a 200-megabyte file
p168
aVlooks like this, ladies and gentlemen. OK?
p169
aVSo the next time you download a gigabyte,
p170
aVor two gigabytes, it\u2019s not for free, OK?
p171
aVThe connection is the energy it takes to run the web ,
p172
aVand to make everything we think possible, possible.
p173
aVThanks, Chris.
p174
aV(Applause)

human imagination. <em>TIME</em> twice named him one of the &quot;50 most influential business leaders in the digital age,&quot; and he holds more than 200 patents. Jay Walker&#39;s companies -- under Walker Digital -- have alone served tens of millions of people and amassed billions in value.&nbsp;</p><p>A chunk of his net worth went into building this enchanting library space, whose exhibits (please touch!) go back, roughly, to the point our species learned to write, with a slight post-moveable type bias. Brimming with exquisitely illustrated books and artifacts (Enigma machine; velociraptor skeleton), the library itself is a marvel. Is it the glowing etched glass panels, or the Vivaldi piped from hidden speakers that gives it that je ne sais quoi? Maybe it&#39;s Walker himself, whose passion for the stuff just glows. It&#39;s apparent to those lucky enough to snag a tour. </p><p>At the 2008 TED Conference, Walker lent many of his priceless and geeky artifacts to decorate the stage -- including a real Sputnik artificial satellite, a Star Wars stormtrooper helmet and a Gutenberg bible.

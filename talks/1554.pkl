VHi. So I'd like to talk a little bit about the people
p5
aVwho make the things we use every day:
p6
aVour shoes, our handbags, our computers and cell phones.
p7
aVNow, this is a conversation that often calls up a lot of guilt.
p8
aVImagine the teenage farm girl who makes less than
p9
aVa dollar an hour stitching your running shoes,
p10
aVor the young Chinese man who jumps off a rooftop
p11
aVafter working overtime assembling your iPad.
p12
aVWe, the beneficiaries of globalization, seem to exploit
p13
aVthese victims with every purchase we make,
p14
aVand the injustice
p15
aVfeels embedded in the products themselves.
p16
aVAfter all, what's wrong with a world in which a worker
p17
aVon an iPhone assembly line can't even afford to buy one?
p18
aVIt's taken for granted that Chinese factories are oppressive,
p19
aVand that it's our desire for cheap goods
p20
aVthat makes them so.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo, this simple narrative equating Western demand
p23
aVand Chinese suffering is appealing,
p24
aVespecially at a time when many of us already feel guilty
p25
aVabout our impact on the world,
p26
aVbut it's also inaccurate and disrespectful.
p27
aVWe must be peculiarly self-obsessed to imagine that we
p28
aVhave the power to drive tens of millions of people
p29
aVon the other side of the world to migrate and suffer
p30
aVin such terrible ways.
p31
aVIn fact, China makes goods for markets all over the world,
p32
aVincluding its own, thanks to a combination of factors:
p33
aVits low costs, its large and educated workforce,
p34
aVand a flexible manufacturing system
p35
aVthat responds quickly to market demands.
p36
aVBy focusing so much on ourselves and our gadgets,
p37
aVwe have rendered the individuals on the other end
p38
aVinto invisibility, as tiny and interchangeable
p39
aVas the parts of a mobile phone.
p40
aa(lp41
VChinese workers are not forced into factories
p42
aVbecause of our insatiable desire for iPods.
p43
aVThey choose to leave their homes in order to earn money,
p44
aVto learn new skills, and to see the world.
p45
aVIn the ongoing debate about globalization, what's
p46
aVbeen missing is the voices of the workers themselves.
p47
aa(lp48
VHere are a few.
p49
aa(lp50
VBao Yongxiu: "My mother tells me to come home
p51
aVand get married, but if I marry now, before I have fully
p52
aVdeveloped myself, I can only marry an ordinary worker,
p53
aVso I'm not in a rush."
p54
aa(lp55
VChen Ying: "When I went home for the new year,
p56
aVeveryone said I had changed. They asked me,
p57
aVwhat did you do that you have changed so much?
p58
aVI told them that I studied and worked hard. If you tell them
p59
aVmore, they won't understand anyway."
p60
aa(lp61
VWu Chunming: "Even if I make a lot of money,
p62
aVit won't satisfy me.
p63
aVJust to make money is not enough meaning in life."
p64
aa(lp65
VXiao Jin: "Now, after I get off work, I study English,
p66
aVbecause in the future, our customers won't
p67
aVbe only Chinese, so we must learn more languages."
p68
aa(lp69
VAll of these speakers, by the way, are young women,
p70
aV18 or 19 years old.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo I spent two years getting to know assembly line workers
p73
aVlike these in the south China factory city called Dongguan.
p74
aVCertain subjects came up over and over:
p75
aVhow much money they made,
p76
aVwhat kind of husband they hoped to marry,
p77
aVwhether they should jump to another factory
p78
aVor stay where they were.
p79
aVOther subjects came up almost never, including
p80
aVliving conditions that to me looked close to prison life:
p81
aV10 or 15 workers in one room,
p82
aV50 people sharing a single bathroom,
p83
aVdays and nights ruled by the factory clock.
p84
aVEveryone they knew lived in similar circumstances,
p85
aVand it was still better than the dormitories and homes
p86
aVof rural China.
p87
aa(lp88
VThe workers rarely spoke about the products they made,
p89
aVand they often had great difficulty explaining
p90
aVwhat exactly they did.
p91
aVWhen I asked Lu Qingmin,
p92
aVthe young woman I got to know best,
p93
aVwhat exactly she did on the factory floor,
p94
aVshe said something to me in Chinese that sounded like
p95
aV"qiu xi."
p96
aVOnly much later did I realize that she had been saying
p97
aV"QC," or quality control.
p98
aVShe couldn't even tell me what she did on the factory floor.
p99
aVAll she could do was parrot a garbled abbreviation
p100
aVin a language she didn't even understand.
p101
aa(lp102
VKarl Marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism,
p103
aVthe alienation of the worker from the product of his labor.
p104
aVUnlike, say, a traditional maker of shoes or cabinets,
p105
aVthe worker in an industrial factory has no control,
p106
aVno pleasure, and no true satisfaction or understanding
p107
aVin her own work.
p108
aVBut like so many theories that Marx arrived at
p109
aVsitting in the reading room of the British Museum,
p110
aVhe got this one wrong.
p111
aVJust because a person spends her time
p112
aVmaking a piece of something does not mean
p113
aVthat she becomes that, a piece of something.
p114
aVWhat she does with the money she earns,
p115
aVwhat she learns in that place, and how it changes her,
p116
aVthese are the things that matter.
p117
aVWhat a factory makes is never the point, and
p118
aVthe workers could not care less who buys their products.
p119
aa(lp120
VJournalistic coverage of Chinese factories,
p121
aVon the other hand, plays up this relationship
p122
aVbetween the workers and the products they make.
p123
aVMany articles calculate: How long would it take
p124
aVfor this worker to work in order to earn enough money
p125
aVto buy what he's making?
p126
aVFor example, an entry-level-line assembly line worker
p127
aVin China in an iPhone plant would have to shell out
p128
aVtwo and a half months' wages for an iPhone.
p129
aa(lp130
VBut how meaningful is this calculation, really?
p131
aVFor example, I recently wrote an article
p132
aVin The New Yorker magazine,
p133
aVbut I can't afford to buy an ad in it.
p134
aVBut, who cares? I don't want an ad in The New Yorker,
p135
aVand most of these workers don't really want iPhones.
p136
aVTheir calculations are different.
p137
aVHow long should I stay in this factory?
p138
aVHow much money can I save?
p139
aVHow much will it take to buy an apartment or a car,
p140
aVto get married, or to put my child through school?
p141
aa(lp142
VThe workers I got to know had a curiously abstract
p143
aVrelationship with the product of their labor.
p144
aVAbout a year after I met Lu Qingmin, or Min,
p145
aVshe invited me home to her family village
p146
aVfor the Chinese New Year.
p147
aVOn the train home, she gave me a present:
p148
aVa Coach brand change purse with brown leather trim.
p149
aVI thanked her, assuming it was fake,
p150
aVlike almost everything else for sale in Dongguan.
p151
aVAfter we got home, Min gave her mother another present:
p152
aVa pink Dooney & Bourke handbag,
p153
aVand a few nights later, her sister was showing off
p154
aVa maroon LeSportsac shoulder bag.
p155
aVSlowly it was dawning on me that these handbags
p156
aVwere made by their factory,
p157
aVand every single one of them was authentic.
p158
aa(lp159
VMin's sister said to her parents,
p160
aV"In America, this bag sells for 320 dollars."
p161
aVHer parents, who are both farmers, looked on, speechless.
p162
aV"And that's not all \u2014 Coach is coming out with a new line,
p163
aV2191," she said. "One bag will sell for 6,000."
p164
aVShe paused and said, "I don't know if that's 6,000 yuan or
p165
aV6,000 American dollars, but anyway, it's 6,000." (Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
VMin's sister's boyfriend, who had traveled home with her
p168
aVfor the new year, said,
p169
aV"It doesn't look like it's worth that much."
p170
aa(lp171
VMin's sister turned to him and said, "Some people actually
p172
aVunderstand these things. You don't understand shit."
p173
aa(lp174
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p175
aa(lp176
VIn Min's world, the Coach bags had a curious currency.
p177
aVThey weren't exactly worthless, but they were nothing
p178
aVclose to the actual value, because almost no one they knew
p179
aVwanted to buy one, or knew how much it was worth.
p180
aVOnce, when Min's older sister's friend got married,
p181
aVshe brought a handbag along as a wedding present.
p182
aVAnother time, after Min had already left
p183
aVthe handbag factory, her younger sister came to visit,
p184
aVbringing two Coach Signature handbags as gifts.
p185
aa(lp186
VI looked in the zippered pocket of one,
p187
aVand I found a printed card in English, which read,
p188
aV"An American classic.
p189
aVIn 1941, the burnished patina
p190
aVof an all-American baseball glove
p191
aVinspired the founder of Coach to create
p192
aVa new collection of handbags from the same
p193
aVluxuriously soft gloved-hand leather.
p194
aVSix skilled leatherworkers crafted 12 Signature handbags
p195
aVwith perfect proportions and a timeless flair.
p196
aVThey were fresh, functional, and women everywhere
p197
aVadored them. A new American classic was born."
p198
aa(lp199
VI wonder what Karl Marx would have made of Min
p200
aVand her sisters.
p201
aVTheir relationship with the product of their labor
p202
aVwas more complicated, surprising and funny
p203
aVthan he could have imagined.
p204
aVAnd yet, his view of the world persists, and our tendency
p205
aVto see the workers as faceless masses,
p206
aVto imagine that we can know what they're really thinking.
p207
aa(lp208
VThe first time I met Min, she had just turned 18
p209
aVand quit her first job on the assembly line
p210
aVof an electronics factory.
p211
aVOver the next two years, I watched as she switched jobs
p212
aVfive times, eventually landing a lucrative post
p213
aVin the purchasing department of a hardware factory.
p214
aVLater, she married a fellow migrant worker,
p215
aVmoved with him to his village,
p216
aVgave birth to two daughters,
p217
aVand saved enough money to buy a secondhand Buick
p218
aVfor herself and an apartment for her parents.
p219
aVShe recently returned to Dongguan on her own
p220
aVto take a job in a factory that makes construction cranes,
p221
aVtemporarily leaving her husband and children
p222
aVback in the village.
p223
aa(lp224
VIn a recent email to me, she explained,
p225
aV"A person should have some ambition while she is young
p226
aVso that in old age she can look back on her life
p227
aVand feel that it was not lived to no purpose."
p228
aa(lp229
VAcross China, there are 150 million workers like her,
p230
aVone third of them women, who have left their villages
p231
aVto work in the factories, the hotels, the restaurants
p232
aVand the construction sites of the big cities.
p233
aVTogether, they make up the largest migration in history,
p234
aVand it is globalization, this chain that begins
p235
aVin a Chinese farming village
p236
aVand ends with iPhones in our pockets and Nikes on our feet
p237
aVand Coach handbags on our arms
p238
aVthat has changed the way these millions of people
p239
aVwork and marry and live and think.
p240
aVVery few of them would want to go back
p241
aVto the way things used to be.
p242
aa(lp243
VWhen I first went to Dongguan, I worried that
p244
aVit would be depressing to spend so much time with workers.
p245
aVI also worried that nothing would ever happen to them,
p246
aVor that they would have nothing to say to me.
p247
aVInstead, I found young women who were smart and funny
p248
aVand brave and generous.
p249
aVBy opening up their lives to me,
p250
aVthey taught me so much about factories
p251
aVand about China and about how to live in the world.
p252
aa(lp253
VThis is the Coach purse that Min gave me
p254
aVon the train home to visit her family.
p255
aVI keep it with me to remind me of the ties that tie me
p256
aVto the young women I wrote about,
p257
aVties that are not economic but personal in nature,
p258
aVmeasured not in money but in memories.
p259
aVThis purse is also a reminder that the things that you imagine,
p260
aVsitting in your office or in the library,
p261
aVare not how you find them when you actually go out
p262
aVinto the world.
p263
aa(lp264
VThank you. (Applause)
p265
aV(Applause)
p266
aa(lp267
VChris Anderson: Thank you, Leslie, that was an insight
p268
aVthat a lot of us haven't had before.
p269
aVBut I'm curious. If you had a minute, say,
p270
aVwith Apple's head of manufacturing,
p271
aVwhat would you say?
p272
aa(lp273
VLeslie Chang: One minute?
p274
aa(lp275
VCA: One minute. (Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
VLC: You know, what really impressed me about the workers
p278
aVis how much they're self-motivated, self-driven,
p279
aVresourceful, and the thing that struck me,
p280
aVwhat they want most is education, to learn,
p281
aVbecause most of them come from very poor backgrounds.
p282
aVThey usually left school when they were in 7th or 8th grade.
p283
aVTheir parents are often illiterate,
p284
aVand then they come to the city, and they, on their own,
p285
aVat night, during the weekends, they'll take a computer class,
p286
aVthey'll take an English class, and learn
p287
aVreally, really rudimentary things, you know,
p288
aVlike how to type a document in Word,
p289
aVor how to say really simple things in English.
p290
aVSo, if you really want to help these workers,
p291
aVstart these small, very focused, very pragmatic classes
p292
aVin these schools, and what's going to happen is,
p293
aVall your workers are going to move on,
p294
aVbut hopefully they'll move on into higher jobs within Apple,
p295
aVand you can help their social mobility
p296
aVand their self-improvement.
p297
aVWhen you talk to workers, that's what they want.
p298
aVThey do not say, "I want better hot water in the showers.
p299
aVI want a nicer room. I want a TV set."
p300
aVI mean, it would be nice to have those things,
p301
aVbut that's not why they're in the city,
p302
aVand that's not what they care about.
p303
aa(lp304
VCA: Was there a sense from them of a narrative that
p305
aVthings were kind of tough and bad, or was there a narrative
p306
aVof some kind of level of growth, that things over time
p307
aVwere getting better?
p308
aa(lp309
VLC: Oh definitely, definitely. I mean, you know,
p310
aVit was interesting, because I spent basically two years
p311
aVhanging out in this city, Dongguan,
p312
aVand over that time, you could see immense change
p313
aVin every person's life: upward, downward, sideways,
p314
aVbut generally upward.
p315
aVIf you spend enough time, it's upward, and I met people
p316
aVwho had moved to the city 10 years ago, and who are now
p317
aVbasically urban middle class people,
p318
aVso the trajectory is definitely upward.
p319
aVIt's just hard to see when you're suddenly
p320
aVsucked into the city. It looks like everyone's poor and
p321
aVdesperate, but that's not really how it is.
p322
aVCertainly, the factory conditions are really tough,
p323
aVand it's nothing you or I would want to do,
p324
aVbut from their perspective, where they're coming from
p325
aVis much worse, and where they're going
p326
aVis hopefully much better, and I just wanted to give
p327
aVthat context of what's going on in their minds,
p328
aVnot what necessarily is going on in yours.
p329
aa(lp330
VCA: Thanks so much for your talk.
p331
aVThank you very much. (Applause)

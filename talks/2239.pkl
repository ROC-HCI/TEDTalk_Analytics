VTo be honest, by personality,
p5
aVI'm just not much of a crier.
p6
aVBut I think in my career that's been a good thing.
p7
aVI'm a civil rights lawyer,
p8
aVand I've seen some  horrible things in the world.
p9
aVI began my career working  police abuse cases in the United States.
p10
aVAnd then in 1994, I was sent to Rwanda
p11
aVto be the director of the U.N.'s  genocide investigation.
p12
aVIt turns out that tears  just aren't much help
p13
aVwhen you're trying  to investigate a genocide.
p14
aVThe things I had to see,  and feel and touch
p15
aVwere pretty unspeakable.
p16
aa(lp17
VWhat I can tell you is this:
p18
aVthat the Rwandan genocide
p19
aVwas one of the world's greatest failures of simple compassion.
p20
aVThat word, compassion, actually  comes from two Latin words:
p21
aVcum passio, which simply mean  "to suffer with."
p22
aVAnd the things that I saw and experienced
p23
aVin Rwanda as I got up close to human suffering,
p24
aVit did, in moments, move me to tears.
p25
aVBut I just wish that I,  and the rest of the world,
p26
aVhad been moved earlier.
p27
aVAnd not just to tears,
p28
aVbut to actually stop the genocide.
p29
aa(lp30
VNow by contrast, I've also been involved
p31
aVwith one of the world's greatest successes of compassion.
p32
aVAnd that's the fight against  global poverty.
p33
aVIt's a cause that probably has involved all of us here.
p34
aVI don't know if your first introduction
p35
aVmight have been choruses of "We Are the World,"
p36
aVor maybe the picture of a sponsored child on your refrigerator door,
p37
aVor maybe the birthday you donated for fresh water.
p38
aVI don't really remember what my first introduction to poverty was
p39
aVbut I do remember the most jarring.
p40
aa(lp41
VIt was when I met Venus \u2014
p42
aVshe's a mom from Zambia.
p43
aVShe's got three kids and she's a widow.
p44
aVWhen I met her, she had walked about 12 miles
p45
aVin the only garments she owned,
p46
aVto come to the capital city and to share her story.
p47
aVShe sat down with me for hours,
p48
aVjust ushered me in to  the world of poverty.
p49
aVShe described what it was like  when the coals on the cooking fire
p50
aVfinally just went completely cold.
p51
aVWhen that last drop  of cooking oil finally ran out.
p52
aVWhen the last of the food,  despite her best efforts,
p53
aVran out.
p54
aVShe had to watch her youngest son, Peter,
p55
aVsuffer from malnutrition,
p56
aVas his legs just slowly bowed  into uselessness.
p57
aVAs his eyes grew cloudy and dim.
p58
aVAnd then as Peter finally grew cold.
p59
aa(lp60
VFor over 50 years, stories like this have been moving us to compassion.
p61
aVWe whose kids have plenty to eat.
p62
aVAnd we're moved not only  to care about global poverty,
p63
aVbut to actually try to do our part  to stop the suffering.
p64
aVNow there's plenty of room for critique  that we haven't done enough,
p65
aVand what it is that we've done hasn't been effective enough,
p66
aVbut the truth is this:
p67
aVThe fight against global poverty is probably the broadest,
p68
aVlongest running manifestation of the  human phenomenon of compassion
p69
aVin the history of our species.
p70
aVAnd so I'd like to share a pretty shattering insight
p71
aVthat might forever change the way you think about that struggle.
p72
aa(lp73
VBut first, let me begin with what you probably already know.
p74
aVThirty-five years ago, when I would have been graduating from high school,
p75
aVthey told us that 40,000 kids every day died because of poverty.
p76
aVThat number, today, is now  down to 17,000.
p77
aVWay too many, of course,
p78
aVbut it does mean that every year,
p79
aVthere's eight million kids who don't have to die from poverty.
p80
aVMoreover, the number of  people in our world
p81
aVwho are living in extreme poverty,
p82
aVwhich is defined as living off about a dollar and a quarter a day,
p83
aVthat has fallen from 50 percent,
p84
aVto only 15 percent.
p85
aVThis is massive progress,
p86
aVand this exceeds everybody's  expectations about what is possible.
p87
aVAnd I think you and I,
p88
aVI think, honestly, that we can  feel proud and encouraged
p89
aVto see the way that compassion  actually has the power
p90
aVto succeed in stopping  the suffering of millions.
p91
aa(lp92
VBut here's the part that you  might not hear very much about.
p93
aVIf you move that poverty mark just up to two dollars a day,
p94
aVit turns out that virtually  the same two billion people
p95
aVwho were stuck in that harsh poverty when I was in high school,
p96
aVare still stuck there,
p97
aV35 years later.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo why, why are so many billions still stuck in such harsh poverty?
p100
aVWell, let's think about Venus for a moment.
p101
aVNow for decades, my wife and I have been moved by common compassion
p102
aVto sponsor kids, to fund microloans,
p103
aVto support generous levels of foreign aid.
p104
aVBut until I had actually talked to Venus,
p105
aVI would have had no idea that  none of those approaches
p106
aVactually addressed why she had to watch her son die.
p107
aV"We were doing fine," Venus told me,
p108
aV"until Brutus started to cause trouble."
p109
aVNow, Brutus is Venus' neighbor  and "cause trouble"
p110
aVis what happened the day after Venus' husband died,
p111
aVwhen Brutus just came and threw Venus and the kids out of the house,
p112
aVstole all their land, and robbed their market stall.
p113
aVYou see, Venus was thrown  into destitution by violence.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd then it occurred to me, of course,
p116
aVthat none of my child sponsorships, none of the microloans,
p117
aVnone of the traditional  anti-poverty programs
p118
aVwere going to stop Brutus,
p119
aVbecause they weren't meant to.
p120
aa(lp121
VThis became even more clear to me when I met Griselda.
p122
aVShe's a marvelous young girl living in a very poor community
p123
aVin Guatemala.
p124
aVAnd one of the things we've learned over the years
p125
aVis that perhaps the most powerful thing
p126
aVthat Griselda and her family can do
p127
aVto get Griselda and her family  out of poverty
p128
aVis to make sure that she goes to school.
p129
aVThe experts call this the Girl Effect.
p130
aVBut when we met Griselda,  she wasn't going to school.
p131
aVIn fact, she was rarely ever  leaving her home.
p132
aa(lp133
VDays before we met her,
p134
aVwhile she was walking home from church with her family,
p135
aVin broad daylight,
p136
aVmen from her community  just snatched her off the street,
p137
aVand violently raped her.
p138
aVSee, Griselda had every opportunity to go to school,
p139
aVit just wasn't safe for her to get there.
p140
aVAnd Griselda's not the only one.
p141
aVAround the world, poor women and girls
p142
aVbetween the ages of 15 and 44,
p143
aVthey are \u2014 when victims of  the everyday violence
p144
aVof domestic abuse and sexual violence \u2014
p145
aVthose two forms of violence account for more death and disability
p146
aVthan malaria, than car accidents, than war combined.
p147
aVThe truth is, the poor of our world are trapped in whole systems of violence.
p148
aa(lp149
VIn South Asia, for instance, I could drive past this rice mill
p150
aVand see this man hoisting  these 100-pound sacks
p151
aVof rice upon his thin back.
p152
aVBut I would have no idea, until later,
p153
aVthat he was actually a slave,
p154
aVheld by violence in that rice mill since I was in high school.
p155
aVDecades of anti-poverty programs right in his community
p156
aVwere never able to rescue him or any of the hundred other slaves
p157
aVfrom the beatings and the rapes and the torture
p158
aVof violence inside the rice mill.
p159
aVIn fact, half a century of  anti-poverty programs
p160
aVhave left more poor people in slavery
p161
aVthan in any other time in human history.
p162
aa(lp163
VExperts tell us that there's about 35 million people in slavery today.
p164
aVThat's about the population  of the entire nation of Canada,
p165
aVwhere we're sitting today.
p166
aVThis is why, over time, I have come to call this epidemic of violence
p167
aVthe Locust Effect.
p168
aVBecause in the lives of the poor, it just descends like a plague
p169
aVand it destroys everything.
p170
aVIn fact, now when you survey very, very poor communities,
p171
aVresidents will tell you that their greatest fear is violence.
p172
aVBut notice the violence that they fear
p173
aVis not the violence of  genocide or the wars,
p174
aVit's everyday violence.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo for me, as a lawyer, of course, my first reaction was to think,
p177
aVwell, of course we've got to change all the laws.
p178
aVWe've got to make all this violence against the poor illegal.
p179
aVBut then I found out, it already is.
p180
aVThe problem is not that  the poor don't get laws,
p181
aVit's that they don't get law enforcement.
p182
aVIn the developing world,
p183
aVbasic law enforcement systems are so broken
p184
aVthat recently the U.N. issued  a report that found
p185
aVthat "most poor people live outside the protection of the law."
p186
aVNow honestly, you and I have  just about no idea
p187
aVof what that would mean
p188
aVbecause we have no  first-hand experience of it.
p189
aVFunctioning law enforcement for us  is just a total assumption.
p190
aVIn fact, nothing expresses that assumption more clearly than three simple numbers:
p191
aV9-1-1,
p192
aVwhich, of course, is the number for the emergency police operator
p193
aVhere in Canada and in the United States,
p194
aVwhere the average response time  to a police 911 emergency call
p195
aVis about 10 minutes.
p196
aVSo we take this just  completely for granted.
p197
aa(lp198
VBut what if there was no  law enforcement to protect you?
p199
aVA woman in Oregon recently experienced what this would be like.
p200
aVShe was home alone in her  dark house on a Saturday night,
p201
aVwhen a man started to tear  his way into her home.
p202
aVThis was her worst nightmare,
p203
aVbecause this man had actually put her in the hospital from an assault
p204
aVjust two weeks before.
p205
aVSo terrified, she picks up that phone and does what any of us would do:
p206
aVShe calls 911 \u2014
p207
aVbut only to learn that because  of budget cuts in her county,
p208
aVlaw enforcement wasn't available  on the weekends.
p209
aVListen.
p210
aVDispatcher: I don't have anybody  to send out there.
p211
aVWoman: OK
p212
aVDispatcher: Um, obviously if he comes inside the residence and assaults you,
p213
aVcan you ask him to go away?
p214
aVOr do you know if he is intoxicated or anything?
p215
aVWoman: I've already asked him. I've already told him I was calling you.
p216
aVHe's broken in before, busted down my door, assaulted me.
p217
aVDispatcher: Uh-huh.
p218
aVWoman: Um, yeah, so ...
p219
aVDispatcher: Is there any way you could safely leave the residence?
p220
aVWoman: No, I can't, because he's blocking pretty much my only way out.
p221
aVDispatcher: Well, the only thing I can do  is give you some advice,
p222
aVand call the sheriff's office tomorrow.
p223
aVObviously, if he comes in and unfortunately has a weapon
p224
aVor is trying to cause you physical harm, that's a different story.
p225
aVYou know, the sheriff's office doesn't work up there.
p226
aVI don't have anybody to send."
p227
aa(lp228
VGary Haugen: Tragically, the woman  inside that house
p229
aVwas violently assaulted, choked and raped
p230
aVbecause this is what it means to live outside the rule of law.
p231
aVAnd this is where billions of our poorest live.
p232
aVWhat does that look like?
p233
aVIn Bolivia, for example, if a man  sexually assaults a poor child,
p234
aVstatistically, he's at greater risk of slipping in the shower and dying
p235
aVthan he is of ever going  to jail for that crime.
p236
aVIn South Asia, if you  enslave a poor person,
p237
aVyou're at greater risk of being  struck by lightning
p238
aVthan ever being sent  to jail for that crime.
p239
aVAnd so the epidemic of everyday  violence, it just rages on.
p240
aVAnd it devastates our efforts to try to help billions of people
p241
aVout of their two-dollar-a-day hell.
p242
aVBecause the data just doesn't lie.
p243
aVIt turns out that you can give  all manner of goods and services
p244
aVto the poor,
p245
aVbut if you don't restrain the hands  of the violent bullies
p246
aVfrom taking it all away,
p247
aVyou're going to be very disappointed in the long-term impact of your efforts.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo you would think that the disintegration of basic law enforcement
p250
aVin the developing world would be a huge priority
p251
aVfor the global fight against poverty.
p252
aVBut it's not.
p253
aVAuditors of international assistance recently couldn't find
p254
aVeven one percent of aid going  to protect the poor
p255
aVfrom the lawless chaos  of everyday violence.
p256
aVAnd honestly, when we do talk about  violence against the poor,
p257
aVsometimes it's in the weirdest of ways.
p258
aVA fresh water organization tells a heart-wrenching story
p259
aVof girls who are raped on the way to fetching water,
p260
aVand then celebrates the solution of a new well
p261
aVthat drastically shortens their walk.
p262
aVEnd of story.
p263
aVBut not a word about the rapists who are still right there in the community.
p264
aVIf a young woman on one  of our college campuses
p265
aVwas raped on her walk to the library,
p266
aVwe would never celebrate the solution of moving the library closer to the dorm.
p267
aVAnd yet, for some reason, this is okay for poor people.
p268
aa(lp269
VNow the truth is, the traditional experts
p270
aVin economic development and poverty alleviation,
p271
aVthey don't know how to fix this problem.
p272
aVAnd so what happens?
p273
aVThey don't talk about it.
p274
aVBut the more fundamental reason
p275
aVthat law enforcement for the poor in the developing world
p276
aVis so neglected,
p277
aVis because the people inside the developing world, with money,
p278
aVdon't need it.
p279
aVI was at the World Economic  Forum not long ago
p280
aVtalking to corporate executives who have massive businesses in the developing world
p281
aVand I was just asking them,
p282
aV"How do you guys protect all your people and property from all the violence?"
p283
aVAnd they looked at each other,  and they said, practically in unison,
p284
aV"We buy it."
p285
aa(lp286
VIndeed, private security forces  in the developing world
p287
aVare now, four, five and seven times larger than the public police force.
p288
aVIn Africa, the largest employer  on the continent now is private security.
p289
aVBut see, the rich can pay for safety and can keep getting richer,
p290
aVbut the poor can't pay for it and they're left totally unprotected
p291
aVand they keep getting thrown to the ground.
p292
aa(lp293
VThis is a massive and scandalous outrage.
p294
aVAnd it doesn't have to be this way.
p295
aVBroken law enforcement can be fixed.
p296
aVViolence can be stopped.
p297
aVAlmost all criminal justice systems,
p298
aVthey start out broken and corrupt,
p299
aVbut they can be transformed by fierce effort and commitment.
p300
aa(lp301
VThe path forward is really pretty clear.
p302
aVNumber one: We have to start making
p303
aVstopping violence indispensable  to the fight against poverty.
p304
aVIn fact, any conversation about global poverty
p305
aVthat doesn't include the problem  of violence must be deemed not serious.
p306
aa(lp307
VAnd secondly, we have to begin  to seriously invest resources
p308
aVand share expertise to support  the developing world
p309
aVas they fashion new,  public systems of justice,
p310
aVnot private security,
p311
aVthat give everybody a chance to be safe.
p312
aVThese transformations  are actually possible
p313
aVand they're happening today.
p314
aVRecently, the Gates Foundation  funded a project
p315
aVin the second largest city  of the Philippines,
p316
aVwhere local advocates and local law enforcement
p317
aVwere able to transform corrupt police and broken courts so drastically,
p318
aVthat in just four short years,
p319
aVthey were able to measurably reduce
p320
aVthe commercial sexual violence  against poor kids by 79 percent.
p321
aa(lp322
VYou know, from the hindsight of history,
p323
aVwhat's always most inexplicable and inexcusable
p324
aVare the simple failures of compassion.
p325
aVBecause I think history convenes  a tribunal of our grandchildren
p326
aVand they just ask us,
p327
aV"Grandma, Grandpa, where were you?
p328
aVWhere were you, Grandpa, when  the Jews were fleeing Nazi Germany
p329
aVand were being rejected from our shores?
p330
aVWhere were you?
p331
aVAnd Grandma, where were you when they were marching
p332
aVour Japanese-American neighbors off to internment camps?
p333
aVAnd Grandpa, where were you  when they were beating
p334
aVour African-American neighbors
p335
aVjust because they were trying to register to vote?"
p336
aVLikewise, when our grandchildren ask us,
p337
aV"Grandma, Grandpa, where were you
p338
aVwhen two billion of the world's poorest were drowning in a lawless chaos
p339
aVof everyday violence?"
p340
aVI hope we can say that we had compassion, that we raised our voice,
p341
aVand as a generation, we were moved to make the violence stop.
p342
aa(lp343
VThank you very much.
p344
aa(lp345
V(Applause)
p346
aa(lp347
VChris Anderson: Really powerfully argued.
p348
aVTalk to us a bit about some of the things
p349
aVthat have actually been happening to, for example, boost police training.
p350
aVHow hard a process is that?
p351
aVGH: Well, one of the glorious  things that's starting to happen now
p352
aVis that the collapse of these systems and the consequences are becoming obvious.
p353
aVThere's actually, now,  political will to do that.
p354
aVBut it just requires now an investment of resources and transfer of expertise.
p355
aVThere's a political will struggle  that's going to take place as well,
p356
aVbut those are winnable fights,
p357
aVbecause we've done some examples around the world
p358
aVat International Justice Mission that are very encouraging.
p359
aa(lp360
VCA: So just tell us in one country, how much it costs
p361
aVto make a material difference  to police, for example \u2014
p362
aVI know that's only one piece of it.
p363
aVGH: In Guatemala, for instance, we've started a project there
p364
aVwith the local police  and court system, prosecutors,
p365
aVto retrain them so that they can  actually effectively bring these cases.
p366
aVAnd we've seen prosecutions against perpetrators of sexual violence
p367
aVincrease by more than 1,000 percent.
p368
aVThis project has been very modestly funded at about a million dollars a year,
p369
aVand the kind of bang  you can get for your buck
p370
aVin terms of leveraging a criminal justice system
p371
aVthat could function if it were properly trained and motivated and led,
p372
aVand these countries,  especially a middle class
p373
aVthat is seeing that there's  really no future
p374
aVwith this total instability and total privatization of security
p375
aVI think there's an opportunity, a window for change.
p376
aa(lp377
VCA: But to make this happen, you have to look at each part in the chain \u2014
p378
aVthe police, who else?
p379
aVGH: So that's the thing  about law enforcement,
p380
aVit starts out with the police,
p381
aVthey're the front end of the pipeline of justice,
p382
aVbut they hand if off to the prosecutors,
p383
aVand the prosecutors  hand it off to the courts,
p384
aVand the survivors of violence  have to be supported by social services
p385
aVall the way through that.
p386
aVSo you have to do an approach  that pulls that all together.
p387
aVIn the past, there's been a little bit of training of the courts,
p388
aVbut they get crappy evidence  from the police,
p389
aVor a little police intervention  that has to do with narcotics or terrorism
p390
aVbut nothing to do with treating the common poor person
p391
aVwith excellent law enforcement,
p392
aVso it's about pulling that all together,
p393
aVand you can actually have people in very poor communities
p394
aVexperience law enforcement like us,
p395
aVwhich is imperfect in our  own experience, for sure,
p396
aVbut boy, is it a great thing to sense that you can call 911
p397
aVand maybe someone will protect you.
p398
aa(lp399
VCA: Gary, I think you've done  a spectacular job
p400
aVof bringing this to the world's attention
p401
aVin your book and right here today.

VSo I know TED is about a lot of things that are big,
p5
aVbut I want to talk to you about something very small.
p6
aVSo small, it's a single word.
p7
aVThe word is "misfit."
p8
aVIt's one of my favorite words, because it's so literal.
p9
aVI mean, it's a person who sort of missed fitting in.
p10
aVOr a person who fits in badly.
p11
aVOr this: "a person who is poorly adapted
p12
aVto new situations and environments."
p13
aVI'm a card-carrying misfit.
p14
aVAnd I'm here for the other misfits in the room,
p15
aVbecause I'm never the only one.
p16
aVI'm going to tell you a misfit story.
p17
aa(lp18
VSomewhere in my early 30s,
p19
aVthe dream of becoming a writer came right to my doorstep.
p20
aVActually, it came to my mailbox
p21
aVin the form of a letter that said I'd won a giant literary prize
p22
aVfor a short story I had written.
p23
aVThe short story was about my life as a competitive swimmer
p24
aVand about my crappy home life,
p25
aVand a little bit about how grief and loss can make you insane.
p26
aVThe prize was a trip to New York City to meet big-time editors and agents
p27
aVand other authors.
p28
aVSo kind of it was the wannabe writer's dream, right?
p29
aVYou know what I did the day the letter came to my house?
p30
aVBecause I'm me,
p31
aVI put the letter on my kitchen table,
p32
aVI poured myself a giant glass of vodka
p33
aVwith ice and lime,
p34
aVand I sat there in my underwear for an entire day,
p35
aVjust staring at the letter.
p36
aVI was thinking about all the ways I'd already screwed my life up.
p37
aVWho the hell was I to go to New York City
p38
aVand pretend to be a writer?
p39
aVWho was I?
p40
aa(lp41
VI'll tell you.
p42
aVI was a misfit.
p43
aVLike legions of other children,
p44
aVI came from an abusive household
p45
aVthat I narrowly escaped with my life.
p46
aVI already had two epically failed marriages underneath my belt.
p47
aVI'd flunked out of college not once but twice
p48
aVand maybe even a third time that I'm not going to tell you about.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd I'd done an episode of rehab for drug use.
p53
aVAnd I'd had two lovely staycations in jail.
p54
aVSo I'm on the right stage.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VBut the real reason, I think, I was a misfit,
p59
aVis that my daughter died the day she was born,
p60
aVand I hadn't figured out how to live with that story yet.
p61
aVAfter my daughter died I also spent a long time homeless,
p62
aVliving under an overpass
p63
aVin a kind of profound state of zombie grief and loss
p64
aVthat some of us encounter along the way.
p65
aVMaybe all of us, if you live long enough.
p66
aVYou know, homeless people are some of our most heroic misfits,
p67
aVbecause they start out as us.
p68
aVSo you see, I'd missed fitting in to just about every category out there:
p69
aVdaughter, wife, mother, scholar.
p70
aVAnd the dream of being a writer
p71
aVwas really kind of like a small, sad stone in my throat.
p72
aa(lp73
VIt was pretty much in spite of myself that I got on that plane
p74
aVand flew to New York City,
p75
aVwhere the writers are.
p76
aVFellow misfits, I can almost see your heads glowing.
p77
aVI can pick you out of a room.
p78
aVAt first, you would've loved it.
p79
aVYou got to choose the three famous writers you wanted to meet,
p80
aVand these guys went and found them for you.
p81
aVYou got set up at the Gramercy Park Hotel,
p82
aVwhere you got to drink Scotch late in the night
p83
aVwith cool, smart, swank people.
p84
aVAnd you got to pretend you were cool and smart and swank, too.
p85
aVAnd you got to meet a bunch of editors and authors and agents
p86
aVat very, very fancy lunches and dinners.
p87
aVAsk me how fancy.
p88
aa(lp89
VAudience: How fancy?
p90
aa(lp91
VLidia Yuknavitch: I'm making a confession: I stole three linen napkins \u2014
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
Vfrom three different restaurants.
p96
aVAnd I shoved a menu down my pants.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VI just wanted some keepsakes so that when I got home,
p101
aVI could believe it had really happened to me.
p102
aVYou know?
p103
aa(lp104
VThe three writers I wanted to meet
p105
aVwere Carole Maso, Lynne Tillman and Peggy Phelan.
p106
aVThese were not famous, best-selling authors,
p107
aVbut to me, they were women-writer titans.
p108
aVCarole Maso wrote the book that later became my art bible.
p109
aVLynne Tillman gave me permission to believe
p110
aVthat there was a chance my stories could be part of the world.
p111
aVAnd Peggy Phelan reminded me
p112
aVthat maybe my brains could be more important than my boobs.
p113
aVThey weren't mainstream women writers,
p114
aVbut they were cutting a path through the mainstream
p115
aVwith their body stories,
p116
aVI like to think, kind of the way water cut the Grand Canyon.
p117
aa(lp118
VIt nearly killed me with joy
p119
aVto hang out with these three over-50-year-old women writers.
p120
aVAnd the reason it nearly killed me with joy
p121
aVis that I'd never known a joy like that.
p122
aVI'd never been in a room like that.
p123
aVMy mother never went to college.
p124
aVAnd my creative career to that point
p125
aVwas a sort of small, sad, stillborn thing.
p126
aVSo kind of in those first nights in New York I wanted to die there.
p127
aVI was just like, "Kill me now. I'm good. This is beautiful."
p128
aVSome of you in the room will understand what happened next.
p129
aa(lp130
VFirst, they took me to the offices of Farrar, Straus and Giroux.
p131
aVFarrar, Straus and Giroux was like my mega-dream press.
p132
aVI mean, T.S. Eliot and Flannery O'Connor were published there.
p133
aVThe main editor guy sat me down and talked to me for a long time,
p134
aVtrying to convince me I had a book in me
p135
aVabout my life as a swimmer.
p136
aVYou know, like a memoir.
p137
aVThe whole time he was talking to me,
p138
aVI sat there smiling and nodding like a numb idiot,
p139
aVwith my arms crossed over my chest,
p140
aVwhile nothing, nothing, nothing came out of my throat.
p141
aVSo in the end, he patted me on the shoulder
p142
aVlike a swim coach might.
p143
aVAnd he wished me luck
p144
aVand he gave me some free books
p145
aVand he showed me out the door.
p146
aa(lp147
VNext, they took me to the offices of W.W. Norton,
p148
aVwhere I was pretty sure I'd be escorted from the building
p149
aVjust for wearing Doc Martens.
p150
aVBut that didn't happen.
p151
aVBeing at the Norton offices
p152
aVfelt like reaching up into the night sky and touching the moon
p153
aVwhile the stars stitched your name across the cosmos.
p154
aVI mean, that's how big a deal it was to me.
p155
aVYou get it?
p156
aVTheir lead editor, Carol Houck Smith,
p157
aVleaned over right in my face with these beady, bright, fierce eyes
p158
aVand said, "Well, send me something then, immediately!"
p159
aVSee, now most people, especially TED people,
p160
aVwould have run to the mailbox, right?
p161
aVIt took me over a decade to even imagine
p162
aVputting something in an envelope and licking a stamp.
p163
aa(lp164
VOn the last night,
p165
aVI gave a big reading at the National Poetry Club.
p166
aVAnd at the end of the reading,
p167
aVKatharine Kidde of Kidde, Hoyt & Picard Literary Agency,
p168
aVwalked straight up to me and shook my hand
p169
aVand offered me representation, like, on the spot.
p170
aVI stood there and I kind of went deaf.
p171
aVHas this ever happened to you?
p172
aVAnd I almost started crying
p173
aVbecause all the people in the room were dressed so beautifully,
p174
aVand all that came out of my mouth was:
p175
aV"I don't know. I have to think about it."
p176
aVAnd she said, "OK, then," and walked away.
p177
aVAll those open hands out to me, that small, sad stone in my throat ...
p178
aa(lp179
VYou see, I'm trying to tell you something about people like me.
p180
aVMisfit people \u2014 we don't always know how to hope or say yes
p181
aVor choose the big thing,
p182
aVeven when it's right in front of us.
p183
aVIt's a shame we carry.
p184
aVIt's the shame of wanting something good.
p185
aVIt's the shame of feeling something good.
p186
aVIt's the shame of not really believing we deserve to be in the room
p187
aVwith the people we admire.
p188
aa(lp189
VIf I could, I'd go back and I'd coach myself.
p190
aVI'd be exactly like those over-50-year-old women who helped me.
p191
aVI'd teach myself how to want things,
p192
aVhow to stand up, how to ask for them.
p193
aVI'd say, "You! Yeah, you! You belong in the room, too."
p194
aVThe radiance falls on all of us,
p195
aVand we are nothing without each other.
p196
aVInstead, I flew back to Oregon,
p197
aVand as I watched the evergreens and rain come back into view,
p198
aVI just drank many tiny bottles of airplane "feel sorry for yourself."
p199
aVI thought about how, if I was a writer, I was some kind of misfit writer.
p200
aVWhat I'm saying is,
p201
aVI flew back to Oregon without a book deal,
p202
aVwithout an agent,
p203
aVand with only a headful and heart-ful of memories
p204
aVof having sat so near
p205
aVthe beautiful writers.
p206
aVMemory was the only prize I allowed myself.
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd yet, at home in the dark,
p209
aVback in my underwear,
p210
aVI could still hear their voices.
p211
aVThey said, "Don't listen to anyone who tries to get you to shut up
p212
aVor change your story."
p213
aVThey said, "Give voice to the story only you know how to tell."
p214
aVThey said, "Sometimes telling the story
p215
aVis the thing that saves your life."
p216
aa(lp217
VNow I am, as you can see, the woman over 50.
p218
aVAnd I'm a writer.
p219
aVAnd I'm a mother.
p220
aVAnd I became a teacher.
p221
aVGuess who my favorite students are.
p222
aVAlthough it didn't happen the day
p223
aVthat dream letter came through my mailbox,
p224
aVI did write a memoir,
p225
aVcalled "The Chronology of Water."
p226
aVIn it are the stories of how many times I've had to reinvent a self
p227
aVfrom the ruins of my choices,
p228
aVthe stories of how my seeming failures were really just weird-ass portals
p229
aVto something beautiful.
p230
aVAll I had to do was give voice to the story.
p231
aa(lp232
VThere's a myth in most cultures about following your dreams.
p233
aVIt's called the hero's journey.
p234
aVBut I prefer a different myth,
p235
aVthat's slightly to the side of that
p236
aVor underneath it.
p237
aVIt's called the misfit's myth.
p238
aVAnd it goes like this:
p239
aVeven at the moment of your failure,
p240
aVright then, you are beautiful.
p241
aVYou don't know it yet,
p242
aVbut you have the ability to reinvent yourself
p243
aVendlessly.
p244
aVThat's your beauty.
p245
aa(lp246
VYou can be a drunk,
p247
aVyou can be a survivor of abuse,
p248
aVyou can be an ex-con,
p249
aVyou can be a homeless person,
p250
aVyou can lose all your money or your job or your husband
p251
aVor your wife, or the worst thing of all,
p252
aVa child.
p253
aVYou can even lose your marbles.
p254
aVYou can be standing dead center in the middle of your failure
p255
aVand still, I'm only here to tell you,
p256
aVyou are so beautiful.
p257
aVYour story deserves to be heard,
p258
aVbecause you, you rare and phenomenal misfit,
p259
aVyou new species,
p260
aVare the only one in the room
p261
aVwho can tell the story
p262
aVthe way only you would.
p263
aVAnd I'd be listening.
p264
aa(lp265
VThank you.
p266
aa(lp267
V(Applause)
